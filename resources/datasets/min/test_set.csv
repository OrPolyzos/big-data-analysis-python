1	2	Syria airstrikes: Jeremy Corbyn gives Labour MPs free vote 	 is to offer a free vote to MPs on David Cameron’s proposals for UK to bomb Isis in Syria but will make clear that Labour party policy is to oppose airstrikes. The leader will also press Cameron to delay the vote until Labour’s concerns about the justification for the bombing are addressed, as part of a deal he has thrashed out with the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and other senior members of the shadow cabinet over the weekend. His decision averts the threat of a mass shadow cabinet walkout while making it clear that his own firmly held opposition to airstrikes is official Labour party policy, backed by the membership. It will also create a dilemma for Downing Street about whether to press ahead with the vote this week, because undecided Labour MPs are likely to be tempted to back Corbyn’s call for a longer timetable. Cameron has been expected to try for a vote on Wednesday but he has said he will not do so unless he is sure there is a clear majority in favour of strikes. It is understood has been no discussion with No 10 about Labour’s proposals to put off the vote.
9	10	Apple faces damages bill after jury finds iPhone and iPad chip violates processor patent 	Apple Inc could face up to $862m in damages after a US jury on Tuesday found the company used without permission technology owned by the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s licensing arm in chips found in devices including the iPhone 6 and and several versions of the iPad. The jury in Madison, Wisconsin, also said the patent, which improves processor efficiency, was valid. The trial will now move on to determine how much owes in damages. The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (Warf) sued in January 2014 alleging infringement of its 1998 patent for improving chip efficiency. The jury was considering whether Apple’s A7, A8 and A8X processors, found in the 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, as well as versions of the iPad, violated the patent. Apple denied any infringement and argued the patent was invalid, according to court papers. Apple previously tried to convince the US Patent and Trademark Office to review the patent’s validity, but in April the agency rejected the bid. According to a recent ruling by the US district judge William Conley, who is presiding over the case, Apple could be liable for up to $862.4m in damages. He scheduled the trial to proceed in three phases: liability, damages, and finally, whether Apple infringed the patent willfully, which could lead to enhanced penalties. Warf used the patent to sue Intel Corp in 2008, but the case was settled the following year on the eve of trial. In September, Warf launched a second lawsuit against Apple, this time targeting the company’s newest chips, the A9 and A9X, used in the just-released and 6S Plus, as well as the iPad Pro. The case is Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v Apple Inc in the US district court for the Western District of Wisconsin, No. 14-cv-62. Representatives for Warf and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.
24	25	'I'm sitting next to a weirdo on the bus' and other true meanings of emoji 	"o there’s going to be a . Of course there is, there’s a film based on everything these days. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. But the emoji film is going to have a tricky time getting the meanings of emoji right. It’s often the case that the symbols’ official titles do not relate to how we use them every day. The truth is, emoji can mean a vast array of things. Here are some examples of the kinds of ways the following emoji could be used; not necessarily how their creators intended. We’ve mixed in emoji as they appear on both Apple and Android products. Probably one of the most popular emoji, the smirking face is perhaps closest to its intended purpose when used in day-to-day conversation. One-upmanship, nonchalant boasting, or sly good fortune. Examples: The “pensive face” does not look at all pensive, but instead is shorthand for quiet despair. It’s the signifier for the little defeats of modern life. Examples: One of the greatest of emoji, if not greatest. The emoji of true sass. This emoji either conveys a complete indifference, the embodiment of attitude, the equivalent of the meme, or just absolute queenliness. Examples: It’s a moon. Ostensibly a kind of friendly moon. But not according to the public. In popular parlance, this emoji is called “the creepy moon emoji” – although one entry on urban dictionary refers to it as the “ ”. It’s also used in situations of social awkwardness. And it’s been known to be . Perhaps the best ever use, however, was the creepy moon reinvented as the in Miley Cyrus’ video. Examples: i like being mysterious The speak-no-evil monkey – proper name Iwazaru is one of the “ ” in Japanese culture. Iwazaru’s nickname comes from the proverb: “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil”. Of course, speak no evil isn’t really how most of us use this monkey emoji. More than not, it’s to express a visual “oops” at a minor faux-pas, or cheeky recognition that we’ve done something a bit naughty or stupid. “Person with folded hands” doesn’t actually make much sense, so it’s no surprise that this emoji has adopted different meanings. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who use the folded hands emoji to represent prayer, and those who use it to give a high five. Most people come down on the side of prayer hands. But, as rapper Drake, who has on his arm, points out: this debate will run and run. ""If you thought the prayer hands emoji was two people high fiving you the worst kind of person"" This emoji is pretty clear, if the medical mask wasn’t a give away, the bead of cold sweat points to this little yellow blob being sickly, but its general use isn’t as black and white as that. Examples: He’s not exactly dressed for proper exercise, which is just as well, because that’s not how runner is used. Examples: The hundred points symbol is tucked away with all of the boring emoji: random shapes, utility symbols, boring arrows, but this emoji has really broken away from the pack to become one of the most used. It’s meant as show of agreement, or appreciation. Examples:"
27	28	Black Friday 2015: UK retailers serve up alternative options 	At fashion chain Fat Face, today is “thanks for giving” day, while ethical brands Traidcraft and People Tree are telling their shoppers it’s “Just Friday” and independent booksellers are promising that Saturday will be “Civilised Saturday”. A growing number of brands and retailers are cooking up charitable alternatives to the frenzied consumerism of the US-inspired discount day. “It’s obvious that consumers are growing tired of this materialistic consumption culture,” said Larry Bush, Traidcraft’s marketing director. “Imagine if just 1% of the [more than] £1bn that retail analysts predict will be spent on was spent with ethical, fair-trade organisations.” A survey carried out for Traidcraft suggested that 43% of British shoppers would like to see an end to Black Friday. As part of its counter-movement, FatFace will involve store staff and shoppers in helping locally chosen charities. It will donate 10% of any profits made over the weekend, up to a total of £250,000, to those charities. Braintree Clothing, meanwhile, is donating half the value of sales via its website to charities, including Trees for Cities and Care International. Civilised Saturday will see offering massages, tea and cake to soothe weary shoppers.
28	29	A third of boardroom positions should be held by women, UK firms told 	At least a third of boardroom positions at Britain’s biggest companies should be held by women by the end of the decade, according to a report, although it does not recommend that quotas are imposed. , who has been championing gender equality in the boardroom, shows that FTSE 100 companies have exceeded the target of having 25% women on their boards – more than doubling the number in . Then, just 135 of 1,076 (12.5%) FTSE 100 directorships were held by women. There are more women on FTSE 350 boards than ever before – 26.1% at FTSE 100 companies and 19.6% at FTSE 250 firms. Davies said 550 women had been appointed in just over four years. There has also been a dramatic reduction in the number of all-male boards. There were 152 in 2011, but there are no all-male boards in the FTSE 100 and only 15 in the FTSE 250, compared with 131 four years ago. Davies hailed the “near-revolution which has taken place in the boardroom and profound culture change at the heart of British business”. The former trade minister and chairman of Standard Chartered bank has set a new target of 33% female board members by 2020 and widened the scope to all FTSE 350 firms. But he says the introduction of legally enforced quotas was unwarranted as the progress so far proved that the voluntary approach is working. “There is no evidence to warrant an about-turn, but plenty of evidence to show the voluntary regime is working, as each and every month the percentage of women on FTSE boards increases,” the report says. However, Krystyna Nowak of executive search firm Norman Broadbent, who was at the launch of the report, deplored a “missed opportunity” and said Davies’ recommendations were disappointing. She said many companies would simply continue appointing women to non-executive director positions, leaving the executive board to continue to be dominated by men. She called on the government to address this in its equality-boosting measures planned for 2016. The UK ranks sixth in Europe behind Norway, Sweden, France, Finland and Belgium, many of which – including Norway, where women make up 35% of board members – have set formal quotas for female representation. Nora Senior, president of the British Chambers of Commerce, said there was no need for “overbearing government regulation” and called on business to “step up to the task of nurturing the pipeline of women at middle management level on to executive teams”. While British companies have been appointing more female directors, they have been slower to promote women into the top jobs – the chief executive, chief finance officer and chairmanship roles. Most female directors hold non-executive roles. Research by the Guardian conducted this year showed there were . The Davies review says “further work and a renewed focus is required” to increase women’s representation further and have more appointed to chair and senior independent director roles. It called for or an independent steering body to be set up to support companies and report next year. Fiona Woolf, former lord mayor of the City of London, said: “This is no time to rest on our laurels and think the job is done. The figures of 26% of boards now being women of only 100 companies are still far too low when you consider 47% of the workforce and 53% of our graduates are female. The figure of 9.6% in relation to executive positions shows how much room there is for improvement.” At FTSE 100 companies, consumer goods group Unilever is leading the way after doubling the number of women on its board to 50% since 2011 – the only company to achieve gender parity. At Marks & Spencer, female board representation has risen to 41.7%, from 27.3% four years ago. Drinks giant Diageo has gone to 40% from 36.4%. At drugmaker AstraZeneca, as well as Sainsbury’s, the proportion of women has risen to 33.3% from 27.3%. British American Tobacco has moved up to 30.8% from 25%; insurer Standard Life has seen a rise to 30% from 27.3%. The companies in the FTSE 350 with all-male boards were named as Allied Minds, Centamin, Deajan Holdings, HellermannTyton Group, Nostrum Oil and Gas, Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust, Telecom Plus, Wizz Air Holdings, Al Noor Hospitals Group, Clarkson, Genus, Lookers, P2P Global Investments, Scottish Investment Trust, and Tritax Big Box Reit. “It is unacceptable in this day and age to have any all-male boards,” Nicky Morgan, education secretary and minister for women and equalities, said at the launch of the review. The FTSE 100 board with the most dramatic change was Old Mutual, which went from no female representation to 38.5%. Rolls-Royce went from 7.1% to 33.1% while HSBC rose from 16.7% to 42.1%. Davies called on investors to play a more active role in improving gender balance in companies. He said customers and potential employees should act against companies which do not “get” gender diversity. “I think the customer should not be buying the product from those sorts of companies and young people should not be going to work for them,” he said. Reacting to the review, the CBI called on the government to assist companies in increasing the representation of women with more free childcare and promoting flexible working. The Institute of Directors said headhunters and recruiters had a big responsibility to ensure they were looking at candidates from “as wide a pool as possible”. Its chair, Barbara Judge, added: “Women that make it to the top must also help others follow in their footsteps, by acting as role models and mentors.” New research from Audeliss suggests Britain’s boardrooms risk going into reverse gear over the next 18 months, as the terms of current female non-executive directors expire. The executive search firm warns that because there are too few female executives in the pipeline to replace them, it is likely that the percentage of female non-executive directors on boards will fall from 31% to 26%.
32	33	Marks and Spencer customers hit by delays to online shopping orders 	Marks & Spencer has had to delay deliveries of online orders by up to two weeks and withdraw next-day delivery services to stores after being beset by problems at the busiest shopping time of the year. Disappointed customers have been complaining on social media about delays to their orders which have been caused by problems at the retailer’s distribution centre in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, which opened in May last year. While some orders have been delayed by up to two weeks, next-day deliveries to customers’ homes have been taking up to two or three days and M&S has withdrawn its next-day deliveries to stores. The company admitted it had been forced to extend delivery times after its Black Friday weekend promotions as its distribution centre could not keep up with demand. Other retailers have also struggled. Last week Tesco customers were complaining of long delays for click-and-collect orders placed around the time of Black Friday, a relatively new promotional event imported from the US. M&S’s Facebook page has a number of complaints from customers. One wrote that an item ordered a fortnight earlier had been delayed for another week. “Every other shop can deliver quickly – has Christmas crept up on M&S before they noticed. Huh – rubbish service,” the shopper wrote. Another shopper was annoyed after their order was delayed by a week: “Not good enough M&S as some of the items required for this week. Please get your act together or I will be thinking twice about ordering from you.” Monday is predicted to be the biggest shopping of the day of the year so far by data firm Experian and online retailing trade association IMRG. Consumers are predicted to spend £676m and retailers braced for 151m visits to websites. Experian predicted that online shopping would break records this year. “With increased confidence in the standard of delivery services and click and collect, we expect to see people break away from traditional shopping habits,” said James Miller from Experian. While other retailers are experiencing strong increases in online sales as shopping from the sofa becomes more popular, M&S’s website has been losing customers since the retailer took control of its running from Amazon in February. When M&S first opened its state-of-the-art distribution centre, the company said it would be able to handle 1m items a day by the end of this year. But sources said that the 900,000sq ft distribution centre’s high tech automation was beset with problems. The company has previously denied that there were problems at its distribution centre, but online sales slumped 6% at marksandspencer.com in the six months to the end of September. Close to 5 million customers had registered on the site by the start of November, 1 million fewer than on the previous one. Shoppers have found navigating M&S’s new magazine-style site tricky while some have been put off by having to re-register their details in the wake of the handover from Amazon. Sources said the problems at the distribution centre meant that online sales at M&S were set to fall again in this quarter, despite hopes of achieving the same level as last year. M&S said it had reinstated next-day delivery to homes but that deliveries to stores would take at least two days while standard deliveries, which normally take three to five days, could take up to 10 days. It said some products, such as wine and flowers which are not handled at Castle Donington, had not been affected. An M&S spokesperson said: “Our customer is always our top priority and that is why we’ve extended some of our delivery options. The vast majority of orders are delivered on time. If we do miss a delivery date, we will do all we can to rectify it for the customer.” M&S’s new delivery centre is part of a £1bn programme to improve ageing IT and distribution systems in order to ensure it has the right items in stores and is able to handle increasing demand for home deliveries. M&S initially hoped to cut costs by using three distribution centres, down from more than 50 warehouses last year. But it pulled out of building one of the new facilities earlier this year.
33	34	Argos owner sees distorting effect of Black Friday on sales 	Home Retail warned of the impact of Black Friday as sales at its Argos and Homebase chains disappointed over the key Christmas period, amid . Despite a 45% surge in sales on , Argos eked out like-for-like sales growth of just 0.1% in the 18 weeks to 3 January, well below the 2% rise expected in the City. At Homebase, like-for-like sales were up 0.6%, missing the 4.1% growth forecast by analysts. Shares in Home Retail, Britain’s biggest household goods retailer, fell more than 7% on the news. Chief executive John Walden said retailers have learned their lesson from last year’s Black Friday sales bonanza, which wreaked havoc on the high street and hit shops’ profits in the run-up to Christmas. “People will try to be a bit more selective about what’s on sale.” and leave the day focused on electrical goods. Greg Mulholland, the Lib Dem MP for Leeds North West, this week criticised major chains for adopting the US discount day that saw police called to stores across the country as sales events descended into chaos. Black Friday did not boost the total amount of sales or profits above what was already expected, according to online retailers’ association IMRG, but squeezed huge numbers of orders into a few days, putting enormous pressure on delivery systems. Argos had over 13.5 million visitors to its digital channels on Black Friday, three times as many as the year before. Sales slowed before that busy weekend and fell in the weeks after as “consumers satisfied their Christmas shopping lists with bargains”, it said, before returning to growth around Christmas. The chain normally sees a a gradual build in sales in November and December culminating in Christmas, but Black Friday completely distorted the usual pattern for Argos and other chains. Walden admitted that like other retailers, the Argos website had struggled to cope with the spike in demand on Black Friday, but stressed that the site never went down. While he was cautious about making predictions for the next Black Friday, another big sales event seems likely. “We’d be mad to plan for low growth.” Despite the sales miss, Argos managed to protect profit margins by not chasing sales with further aggressive discounts in the run-up to Christmas. It grabbed market share in video games and tablets, while jewellery sales slid.
36	37	TalkTalk says hackers accessed fraction of data originally thought 	A second teenager has been arrested in relation to the alleged theft of data during a cyber-attack on the Telecoms giant Talk Talk. The 16-year-old boy was arrested in Feltham, west London, Metropolitan police said on Friday. He was released on bail until a date yet to be confirmed. His arrest followed that on Monday of a , Northern Ireland, on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act. The 16-year-old’s Feltham home was searched during the arrest on Thursday, as was another residential property in Liverpool. TalkTalk has 4m customers whose bank details and personal information were feared at risk from the attackon its website, which took place a week ago. However, the company said on Friday that the data hacked was significantly less than originally suspected. It said fewer than 21,000 unique bank account numbers and sort codes had been accessed and fewer than 1.2m customer email addresses, names and phone numbers. Fewer than 28,000 obscured credit and debit card details and 15,000 customer dates of birth had been accessed. TalkTalk’s chief executive, Dido Harding, said: ““Given the potential size of this attack, we decided to be as open, honest and transparent as we could because we wanted to keep our customers informed and ensure they had the advice and support they need. Today, we can confirm that the scale of attack was much smaller than we originally suspected, but this does not take away from how seriously we take what has happened and our investigation is still ongoing. “On behalf of everyone at TalkTalk, I would like to apologise to all our customers. We know that we need to work hard to earn back your trust and everyone here is committed to doing that.” TalkTalk has stressed the credit and debit card details cannot be used for financial transactions, as they have the middle six digits missing. The company said it had shared the affected account details with the major UK banks so they could take action to protect customers in the event of attempts to defraud them. The company described the prospects of such attempts as “highly unlikely”. A spokesman said: “Even though the scale of the attack is significantly smaller than initially suspected, we continue to advise customers to be vigilant, and to take all precautions possible to protect themselves from scam phone calls and emails.” The company said it would not call or otherwise contact customers regarding this incident, requesting bank details or other financial or personal information. The cyber-attack is the third to hit TalkTalk in the past eight months, with incidents in August and February also resulting in customers’ data being hacked. with its slow and poor reaction and failure to encrypt and secure data. However, , while conceding that it would be “naive” to rule out the prospect of Talk Talk suffering a similar attack in the future. The Met’s cybercrime unit and officers from the National Crime Agency are investigating the latest breach. 
38	39	Gameover Zeus returns: thieving malware rises a month after police action 	"Online criminals have tried to revive sophisticated money-stealing software called Gameover Zeus - just as researchers have warned of new threats that use much of the same code and are aimed at UK users. The warnings arrived just over a month after , which stole hundreds of thousands of people’s banking logins and extorted victims out of millions of pounds. The original strains targeted by police forces across the world, including the National Crime Agency and the FBI, have been in decline. But it’s become apparent criminals have sought to re-establish GameOver botnets - networks of infected machines that digital crooks use to gather up information and pass it along to their own systems - by taking the code and repurposing it to avoid detection. Security company Malcovery said a new trojan “based heavily on the GameOver Zeus binary” was spreading in spam emails claiming to come from NatWest bank, promising an online statement in an attachment. Anyone who opened the file risked being infected, as many anti-virus systems were not able to detect the malicious software, the researchers said. “Malcovery was able to identify a number of the command-and-control hosts believed to be involved in this attempt to revive the GameOver botnet. Following contact with any of these hosts, the malware began to exhibit behaviors characteristic of the GameOver trojan,” security analysts Brendan Griffin and Gary Warner said in a . “This discovery indicates that the criminals responsible for GameOver’s distribution do not intend to give up on this botnet even after suffering one of the most expansive botnet takeovers/takedowns in history.” Though fresh GameOver Zeus variants will be a concern, Morten Kjærsgaard, CEO of Heimdal Security, which helped in the initial takedown of the malware, told the Guardian he believes the overlords of the original malware will increasingly use lesser-known strains to avoid law enforcement. ""Until we start to see a more clear movement pattern of these new Zeus variants, which are starting to surface, we can't say anything definitive about their extent,” said Kjærsgaard. “There is no doubt though, that many small malware variants could pose the same financial problem for end users as one big nasty piece of malware.” He said the kind of GameOver malware hit by the police action last month was “in a stable to slight decline state”. The GameOver Zeus botnet earned its owners more than $100m. In June, US authorities named Russian national Evgeniy Bogachev as the chief suspect behind the malware. "
39	40	TalkTalk boss says cybersecurity 'head and shoulders' above competitors 	TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding has insisted the company’s cybersecurity is “head and shoulders” better than its competitors in the wake of the massive hack attack affecting thousands of customers. In an interview with the Guardian, Harding conceded it would be “naive” to rule out the prospect of the telecoms firm suffering a similar cyber-attack in the future, describing the threat from hackers as “the crime of our generation”. Asked about claims by an IT researcher that he raised concerns about TalkTalk’s security with her office last September, Harding said its security had “improved dramatically” in the last year. She said: “We are understandably the punchball for everybody wanting to make a point at the moment. Nobody is perfect. God knows, we’ve just demonstrated that our website security wasn’t perfect – I’m not going to pretend it is – but we take it incredibly seriously. “On that specific vulnerability, it’s much better than it was and we are head and shoulders better than some of our competitors and some of the media bodies that were throwing those particular stones.” TalkTalk is unable to say how many of its 4 million customers were affected by the major data breach, in which peoples’ names, addresses and partial bank account details were stolen. The company said on Saturday that the amount of information was “materially lower” than first feared and insisted that it would be impossible for customers to lose any money solely as a result of . Harding said it was “too early to say” whether the company will establish a compensation fund to handle the fallout from the attack because it was still unclear how many customers had been affected and to what degree. Detectives from Scotland Yard’s cybercrime unit are investigating the hack attack specialists amid reports that specialists from BAE Systems have been called in by TalkTalk to track down the hackers. Harding declined to comment on whether she believed those behind the attack would be caught or say whether the company would rule out paying a ransom demand, which was received by the firm before it went public with news of the breach. Asked whether she could promise customers that such an attack would never happen again, Harding said: “No, that would be naive. It would be naive to say something like this will never happen again to any business. “Digital safety is no different to physical safety. You can do your upmost to minimise it. You can arm yourself to protect yourself, but in the end there are criminals everywhere and that’s the way of the world. It’s usually tempting to say there will never ever be another attack but that would be naive.” Paul Moore, an information security consultant, that he had contacted Harding’s office about vulnerabilities on TalkTalk’s website but said the company’s response was “aggressive, defensive and dismissive”. At the time Moore gave TalkTalk a poor cybersecurity rating after running tests on its website, but its score was later increased after the company took steps to fix the vulnerability. Harding, who was elevated to the House of Lords last year with the promise of raising awareness of the dangers facing children online, described hacking as “the crime of our generation” and said it affected every major company in the world. She also hit out at “scaremongering” by media commentators in the wake of the attack, insisting that it was “very irresponsible” to whip up “mass hysteria” about the dangers of the internet. “We are really frustrated with the number of sensationalist claims that are being made, not just about TalkTalk as a company but more importantly about customers losing millions and millions of pounds,” she said. “I think it’s actually very irresponsible because it’s whipping up fear about the digital world. Goodness knows I’ve been one of its biggest fans ... and it’s not right that having lost your bank account number and sort code that people can take money from your bank account – they can’t.” Harding insisted that TalkTalk would “thrive” following the attack if customers saw that it was being transparent about what had happened. She said: “We and our customers are the victim of a criminal attack. What we’re trying to do – and it’s very painful and hard for everybody in the organisation working their socks off – is to be open and transparent about it and share the information maybe earlier than people are used to, so we can warn our customers and protect them.”
43	44	Black Friday scuffles: 'I got a Dyson but I don’t even know if I want it' 	“I got a Dyson but I don’t even know if I want it. I just picked it up,” Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said of her 1am trip to the sales. “It was mental in there. It was crazy. It was absolutely disgusting, disgusting.” Haggerty had ventured out to the 24-hour Sainsbury’s in Harringay, north-east London, with a friend in the hope of snapping up a bargain flat screen TV. “But so many people pushed in the queue we didn’t have a chance,” she said. “The poor woman who was second in the queue was pushed out by the crowd of youths, she didn’t get anything. “People were behaving like animals, it was horrible,” she said. “I only saw two security guards.” Frustrated with not being able to buy a Blaupunkt 40” TV reduced from £299.99 to £149.99, Haggerty rushed to pick up a Dyson Animal Vac, down from £319.99 to £159.99. “I don’t even know how much it costs, I don’t know even know if I’m going to buy it. I just wanted something,” she said. “There are lads in there three, four, five tellies. It’s not fair.” One of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains. “I got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,” he said. “I couldn’t tell you the prices, but I know they’re bargains.” But his mate Henry Fischer, a 19-year-old student, wasn’t as successful. “Someone snatched my telly from me – it’s cos I’m the smaller one.” Blackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsbury’s at 12.45am after retreating from the “bedlam” of Tesco’s 24-hour Lea Valley store, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight. “Tesco was scary so we came here instead,” Blackett said. More than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items – TVs – for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticising the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an when it opened with a midnight sale in 2005. Police intervened at other stores including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said at least two people have been arrested at Black Friday sales events already this morning. The force said on its Twitter feed: “Keep calm people!”. South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became “concerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events”. If your going to Tesco Silverburn, don't bother. Police have shut it down due to fighting over sales. One of the first purchasers of a flatscreen TV, when TV sales began just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. “I bought them for £250, I’ll sell it to you for £350, £300 cash,” he said. Further back in the queue Christine Ball, 62, wasn’t impressed. “I got here at 10.15pm and I’m further back now than when I got here” she said. “None of that lot know what a queue is.” Ball, who like most of the shoppers had not heard of the US-inspired Black Friday sales until this year, said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a TV for Christmas. “Not one of those massive ones, just a normal one at £100 or so,” she said. In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread. “Telly, milk and bread – the necessities,” she said. Mel Mehmet, 23, had been to Black Friday sales last year and had expected queues, but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. “It’s crazy really having it a midnight – the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales. “We’re going to PC World first thing, their sale starts at 8am.” Online the scenes were less hectic but shoppers still faced frustrations: Currys had a waiting list for customers, who had to join a queue (see above). Those eager to snap up bargains on John Lewis also faced similar problems.
55	56	Shoppers flock to laptops rather than stores for holiday shopping 	Online shoppers set a set a single-day spending record on Cyber Monday, despite deals being stretched out this holiday season to a ‘ ’. Online sales Monday jumped 17% from last year, totaling nearly $2.04bn, research firm comScore said. That represents the heaviest online spending day in history and the first to surpass $2bn in sales, said the firm, which tracks online sales. Retailers from Target to Amazon have been offering online deals since the beginning of November, and are promising “cyber” deals all week. Some anticipated the extended period would hurt sales. And the lackluster start to the holiday shopping season at brick-and-mortar stores also lowered expectations. But shoppers appeared to be eager to go online. The weekend after Thanksgiving was popular for online shopping too, with sales up 26% compared to the same weekend last year. The two-day period raked in $2.01bn in online sales, according to comScore. “Any notion that Cyber Monday is declining in importance is really unfounded, as it continues to post new historical highs,” comScore Chairman Emeritus Gian Fulgoni said. This may be part of a larger shift toward online buying as mobile phones spur the practice known as “showrooming,” Fulgoni said in a statement. The term describes the practice of a consumer going into stores to see an item but then buying it or a similar product online. “The data we’re seeing suggest it may be more a change in shopping behavior than a lack of consumer demand,” Fulgoni said. Other organizations measured a more muted response for the day: IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark reported that online sales rose 8.5% this year compared to last on Cyber Monday. That is less stellar growth than last year’s, when IBM says online sales jumped more than 20% by its measure. “As the holiday shopping season becomes less concentrated on a single day, retailers and marketers took advantage by making it easier for consumers to find the best deals on the go, whenever and wherever they chose to shop,” said Jay Henderson, director of IBM Smarter Commerce. Still, Cyber Monday is the busiest US online shopping day of the year — a title it has held since 2010. The name Cyber Monday was coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation’s online arm, called Shop.org, to encourage people to shop online. The name was also a nod to online shopping being done at work where faster connections made it easier to browse. Some retailers painted a rosy picture of the day. Walmart.com said it received the most online orders in its history on Cyber Monday. It added that mobile made up about 70% of the traffic to its website between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. But some shoppers were disappointed by the deals. Preston Neill, 28, from Philadelphia, took advantage of early online deals over the weekend, like 40% off board games from Amazon and Banana Republic clothing that was 40% off. But he said the deals on Cyber Monday seemed similar to what he had already seen earlier. “I haven’t seen anything that jumps out at me,” he said. “I feel like [Cyber Monday] is the Super Bowl of shopping: there is a lot of hype, then it doesn’t quite live up.”
65	66	Apple Music: 6.5m people have paid for first month of streaming service 	 has more than 6.5 million paying customers three weeks after its earliest adopters reached the end of their free trial of the music streaming service, according to chief executive Tim Cook. Talking at the WSJD Live conference in California, Cook indicated that another 8.5 million people are still in the service’s three-month trial period, giving it 15 million users overall. “I think it’s fabulous, and to have over 15 million on there, and 6.5 million in the paid category, I’m really happy about it. And I think the runway here is really good,” said Cook, . Music launched on 30 June, and took its first monthly subscription payments from people who signed up at launch on 30 September. The company’s services boss Eddy Cue announced in early August that Apple Music had signed up 11 million trial members in its first month, but Cook’s comments are the first time the company has revealed any figures on the service’s conversion rate. Did all those 6.5 million subscribers intend to pay for Apple Music, though? Everyone signing up for the free trial agreed to an automatic subscription payment kicking in three months later, unless they cancelled it in the meantime. Music industry analyst Mark Mulligan of Midia Research that as many as half of first-month Apple Music payers would have forgotten to cancel, but would quickly rectify that. Still, according to Cook’s figure, Apple Music is now the second most popular music subscription service behind Spotify, which has 20 million subscribers – although that figure includes people who signed up to a three-month $1 trial of that service, some of whom may have cancelled once that period elapsed. Rival Deezer claims just over 6.3 million, but when the company recently filed to go public, it revealed that , with the rest classed as “monthly inactive bundle subscribers” getting it for free with a mobile contract, but not using it. US streaming radio service Pandora has 3.9 million people paying for its Pandora One premium tier, while Rhapsody – which operates as Napster outside North America – . Rivals like Google Play Music and Rdio have not announced their subscriber figures. 
74	75	Dave Lewis takes over day-to-day running of Tesco UK supermarkets 	, the new chief executive of Tesco, has taken over the day-to-day running of the embattled supermarket’s UK chain as it heads into the crucial Christmas trading weeks. Despite previously admitting that he had , Lewis will take over leadership of the group’s most significant business, which generates the lion’s share of profits. Lewis’s decision to take the reins follows last week’s disastrous handling of its Black Friday sales when police were called to restore order in at least 16 stores where . A senior policeman later referred to the scenes in some of its supermarkets as akin to a mini riot and scolded senior executives, arguing the force’s “scarce resources should not be used to bail out stores when they’ve not planned effectively”. Lewis replaces Chris Bush, the former UK managing director, who was suspended in September following the unearthing of the £264m accounting scandal that is now in the hands of the . Bush stepped aside from the business along with three others: Kevin Grace, the group commercial director, Carl Rogberg, the UK finance director, and John Scouler, food commercial director. The four men are now understood to have left the company. Analysts said the move exposed the shallow talent pool at the struggling grocer. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “It is tough to [be chief executive and run the UK operation] in a group as big as Tesco with its large Asian and European operations. I wish him good luck … a phrase like shuffling the deckchairs comes to mind. has huge problems and they shouldn’t be underestimated.” A Tesco insider added: “Since taking charge of Tesco, Dave Lewis has immersed himself in the day-to-day. The announcement says he is taking the job temporarily so it may be that he is looking for additional talent.” Tesco also revealed that Matt Simister, who was one of four more junior executives asked to step aside as the investigation unfolded, will return to his role as group food sourcing director next week. Lewis said: “We asked Matt to step aside to facilitate our recent investigation into commercial income recognition. During our work it became clear that Matt, in fact, worked tirelessly to resolve the issues we faced. Matt is one of our most capable leaders, and I am confident his leadership will support our agenda in commercial going forward.” Three further executives remain suspended over the accounting irregularities. The investigations into that more junior trio started at a later date. The news of Lewis, a former Unilever executive, being forced to take control of Tesco’s UK business was buried in a statement announcing a restructuring of the management team at the grocer. The changes see Robin Terrell, former online boss at the retailer who had stood in for Bush during his suspension, move to a new role as Tesco’s head of customer. Meanwhile, Jason Tarry, formerly head of clothing at Tesco, who has been standing in for Scouler, becomes head of commercial for the UK and the Tesco group. In a surprise move, Benny Higgins is taking on responsibility for group strategy, in addition to his role leading the bank and international financial services business. Tesco said the changes to the company structure left no role for chief creative officer Matt Atkinson or group business planning and strategy director David Hobbs – neither of whom were implicated in the accounting scandal – and the men are expected to leave the business. Lewis is taking charge of the UK chain during the most important trading weeks of the year. While analysts point to some improvements in Tesco stores, with fewer holes on shelves and shorter queues at its checkouts, that is yet to translate into improved trading with recent market share data showing Tesco’s performance continuing to lag that of its rivals.
76	77	Tesco loses £2bn in value as investigation of profit overstatement begins 	 has been plunged deeper into crisis after it was forced to suspend four senior executives and call in investigators following the discovery that its profits had been artificially inflated by £250m. More than £2bn was wiped off the value of Britain’s biggest retailer on Monday after its new chief executive told the City that forensic accountants and lawyers had been drafted in to scrutinise its books in the wake of a warning from a whistleblower that payments from suppliers were being misbooked and business costs were being glossed over. Tesco said the changes had misleadingly boosted profits by £250m in the first six months of the year. The retailer, which banked £1.6bn profit in the first six months of 2013, is now expected to make half that this year. The seriousness of the situation meant the figure could fall further still. One of the four men suspended was Chris Bush, the most senior executive outside the Tesco boardroom as the manager who oversees its UK operations, which rang up sales of £48bn last year. “We have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly,” said Tesco’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who admitted he did not yet know whether the practice had been going on for some time. There were reports that senior staff at what is the UK’s largest private-sector employer had been asked to hand in company laptops and phones as the inquiry, led by the accountancy firm Deloitte and law firm Freshfields, got under way. Lewis, who has been running Tesco for just three weeks after his predecessor, Phil Clarke, was axed amid a sales slump, said the matter had also been reported to the Financial Conduct Authority. The regulator has the power to prosecute those who make deliberately or recklessly misleading statements to the stock exchange. The company has also been forced to take the unprecedented step of delaying reporting its half-year results to the City by three weeks. Tesco refused to name the individuals at the centre of the investigation but they are understood to be Bush, who has worked for Tesco for 32 years, his number two, Carl Rogberg, John Scouler, its commercial director, and Matt Simister, head of group sourcing. The practices uncovered by the whistleblower are understood to include the acceleration of payments from suppliers for in-store promotions and bonus payments – also paid by suppliers – when the retailer hits sales targets. The question marks over business costs are thought to centre on figures booked for food that is out of date, and stock theft. The whistleblower alerted Tesco’s top lawyer to the mis-statements on Friday afternoon and the information was passed immediately to Lewis. Prior to joining the retailer, the chief executive spent 27 years at Unilever, a major Tesco supplier, but claimed to have never seen supplier payments handled in this way. “We have asked four people, senior people, to step aside,” he said, adding that the action was “not disciplinary or an indication of guilt”. “We will let the investigation determine whether any rules were broken and what I need to do to address that.” Clive Black, an analyst for stockbrokers Shore Capital, said he was “flabbergasted” by the latest turn in the ailing supermarket’s fortunes: “This is not the stuff of a well-operated FTSE-100 organisation.” The accounting inquiry is a disastrous start to Lewis’s reign. He was drafted in from consumer goods giant Unilever to turn around a business that is losing its grip on the UK grocery market as discounters Aldi and Lidl steal shoppers, and the big weekly shop falls out of fashion. More than £10bn has been wiped off the company’s stock market value this year as investors, faced with a grim picture of declining sales and profits, turn their backs. On Monday the shares closed down more than 11% at 203p, their lowest level in more than a decade. The revelations led to calls for Tesco’s chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, to go. His position, according to Black, is “untenable” after overseeing a clearout of top executives that by the end of the summer left the company with just one – Clarke – who was eventually sacked as well. “There should have been a resignation as well as four suspensions to my mind,” said Black. Tesco has poached Alan Stewart from Marks & Spencer to be its new finance director but he is not due to start until December. The previous finance director, Laurie McIlwee, resigned in April and is not thought to have been involved in the day-to-day running of the business since then, despite remaining on the payroll, leaving a critical post unmanned. Broadbent denied the board should have spotted the problem. “Things are always unnoticed until they are noticed,” he said. “This is not a welcome development but it has been caught.” Asked whether he would resign, Broadbent said: “Shareholders will have to decide whether I’m part of the solution or the problem. I intend to be part of the solution.” Also facing scrutiny are Tesco’s longstanding auditors PwC, who, in the retailer’s most recent annual report, said they had looked closely at the timing of payments from suppliers before signing off the accounts. PwC has been asked to assist with the investigation but rival accounting firm Deloitte has been asked to make an independent judgment. One Tesco shareholder said: “There are going to be questions about internal controls, oversight of the processes that were in place and the role of the auditor.” In the past, analysts have accused Tesco of overstating profits by booking rebates or bonuses from suppliers early. It is common practice in the industry to agree a cost price with a supplier at the start of the year but to receive a discount at a later date based on hitting sales targets. Deciding when to book these payments is “art rather than science”, according to one industry insider, but the margin for error would never be expected to be of the magnitude reported by Tesco. “Lots of different businesses flex when they choose to put certain cheques in the bank to hit quarterly targets,” said Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts of the supplier payments. “This is mobile money not related to the timing of sales. But its robbing Peter to pay Paul because if you bring it forward you would have to compensate in the following period.” Bush, 47, joined the company in 1982 and spent more than a decade as UK store director before stints heading Tesco in South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. He returned to the UK as chief operating officer in 2012 and was promoted to the top job in the UK, where the company makes 70% of its sales, in January 2013. Bush says in his that the best piece of advice he was ever given was: “Focus on doing your very best in the job you have and your career will look after itself.” Rogberg worked for Kraft between 1992 and 2000 before co-founding the mobile payments company Mint. In 2004 he went to work for the foreign study company Education First in Hong Kong. He began his career at Tesco as international finance director for Asia in 2006, moving to Thailand to be finance director of Tesco Lotus, where he worked for Bush. A and Newcastle United fan, Scouler joined Tesco in 2002, rising to become commercial director in Hungary before returning to the UK as director of packaged foods in 2010. In 2012 he became UK commercial director in charge of all household, healthcare, baby and beauty products as well as packaged food, beer, wine and spirits, petrol and tobacco products. In a , he was described as a “persuasive operator with a good understanding of the supplier side”. Simister was by Retail Week in 2012 for his work setting up the sourcing division. A business and marketing graduate from the University of Sheffield, Simister has worked as Tesco’s head of meat, fish and poultry and DIY, household and home utilities. He also spent three years as head of operations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. He hit the headlines in 2013 when he blamed Tesco’s customers and suppliers for .
84	85	Pressure mounts on Tesco chief as second-largest shareholder cuts stake 	Tesco’s second biggest shareholder has sold part of its stake in the troubled supermarket chain, it was announced last night, as repercussions mounted from the retailer’s £250m accounting scandal. The US investor BlackRock now controls less than 5% of the retailer’s stock, according to a statement issued to the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday which showed that the sell-off had taken place the day after news emerged that the mishandling of supplier payments meant Tesco’s profits would be much lower than predicted. BlackRock’s stake had edged through 5% in August, but it is not clear how far it has fallen back. shares stabilised after falling 11.5% on Monday and 4% the following day, when new market data revealed a further dive in the supermarket’s sales. The shares have halved in the last 12 months and closed last night at 194.9p. Tesco’s admission of potential accounting problems prompted ratings agency Standard & Poor’s to put its creditworthiness under review yesterday pending the outcome of the retailer’s internal investigation into the affair. Pressure on Tesco’s board, and particularly chairman Sir Richard Broadbent, increased as the ratings agency said it had lowered its assessment of management and governance at the group to “fair” from “satisfactory”. More than one shareholder is understood to be planning to discuss Broadbent’s position. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “Broadbent has said shareholders will decide if he is part of the problem or part of the solution. To my mind part of the problem is that Tesco needs to have an effective chairman.” Tesco confirmed it had not had a finance director for five months until Tuesday, when to help oversee investigators from Deloitte and Freshfields appointed over the weekend to review the accounts. The finances had been in the charge of a group of senior finance personnel reporting directly to the then chief executive, Philip Clarke. As well as the internal investigation, the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Serious Fraud Office and the accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, are all monitoring the situation. On Wednesday the FRC said that a non-executive director of the troubled supermarket business who also sits on the FRC board – Mark Armour – would be frozen out of any discussions . The FRC, which can force companies to restate their accounts and take action against auditors, said it would decide whether to take regulatory action once Tesco had completed its investigation. Tesco’s revelations have sent shockwaves through the retail sector and rivals Morrisons and Sainsbury’s moved to reassure shareholders that they had examined their own reporting standards on supplier incentives, payments and discounts. It is standard practice for suppliers to pay supermarkets for product placement, sales targets and promotions. One accountant said that six of the top 10 UK supermarkets had run an internal audit in the last six years of how they recorded the cash they get from suppliers. “Morrisons is satisfied that supplier income is calculated correctly and recognised in the appropriate period. In their report, KPMG described the work they did in their audit on supplier income and overall gave a clean opinion on the Morrisons accounts,” the Bradford-based chain said in a statement. Sainsbury’s declined to reveal whether it was checking its systems, but said: “Our accounting principles dictate that we recognise income and costs at the appropriate time and we abide by those principles.” Sainsbury is due to update the City on its second-quarter trading next week. Black said: “It is inevitable the subject is going to be raised. Supplier payments are a feature of the retail industry in general, not just the grocery industry, and a lot of company boards will be making sure their policies on revenue recognition are robust.” Began his career at HM Treasury before moving into investment banking and then back to Whitehall.

88	89	Buy-to-let landlords and retirees risk crowding out first-time buyers 	 have been warned that they face increasing competition for properties as figures showed that buy-to-let landlords are looking for mortgages with deposits averaging almost £100,000. Data from the Mortgage Advice Bureau (MAB) based on searches through the UK’s main price comparison sites showed that in the final quarter of 2014, people searching for a buy-to-let mortgage typically said they had £99,914 in equity to put down. The figures include remortgages and new loans taken out to buy properties; according to mortgage lenders, in 2014 the market divided roughly in half between the two. The amount of equity that buy-to-let landlords had was 15% higher than at this time last year, suggesting many have benefited from rising house prices. Savings provider Scottish Friendly suggested first-time buyers “have just months left to buy a house or risk missing out on the chance of getting on the property ladder for years to come”. The group, which offers insurance and investment products, said the imminent relaxation of pension rules in April meant newcomers to the market would be competing for properties with those retiring and keen to invest their funds in bricks and mortar. “The baby-boomer generation has always had an unhealthy obsession with property,” said Neil Lovatt, director at Scottish Friendly. “This has been manageable, even beneficial to the economy when people slowly climbed the property ladder. But the new pension rules will essentially bankroll a generation, allowing them to buy into an already over-inflated market in the expectation that it will help fund their retirement.” MAB’s figures, which are based on 250,000 mortgage searches a month, of which arbout a quarter are for buy-to-let loans, showed landlords were typically seeking to borrow £129,964 of a £229,878 purchase price. This meant an average loan to value of 56.5%, allowing them to secure mortgage rates as low as 1.99%. Brian Murphy, head of lending at MAB, said: “House prices have settled into a steadier pattern in recent months, but the current low rate environment offers many buy-to-let borrowers the chance to reassess their finances. “It means this part of the market is likely to see strong activity this year, both from people who are already involved with BTL and others who are learning the ropes.” There was some good news for first-time buyers, as and an easing off in the annual rate of growth. However separate figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals rose for the second consecutive month in January, prompting some experts to predict house prices will start rising again soon. The report showed the annual rate of price inflation fell for the sixth month running to stand at 5.7% – less than half the 11.8% rate in June 2014 and its lowest level for 16 months. The average price of a UK home has fallen back to £187,964, from the recent peak of £189,306 in August. Nationwide’s figures, which are based on home loans it has approved during the month and adjusted to reflect a typical house, are the first to show prices for February. They are in line with other indicators that have shown waning interest from buyers and a change of mood from a year ago when prices in London and south-east England were spiralling upwards. showed mortgage approvals continued to rise in January to hit a four-month high. There were 60,786 loans approved for home purchase, up from 60,349 in December. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, said the housing market appeared to be nearing a turning point. “House prices held their ground in February according to the Nationwide. But with mortgage approvals rising for the second consecutive month, and mortgage rates dropping yet again, prices will soon return to a gentle upwards trend,” he said.
91	92	How much do musicians really make from Spotify, iTunes and YouTube? 	"In 2010, data journalist and information designer David McCandless published an infographic on his Information is Beautiful website showing . It caused quite a stir within the music industry, which even then was debating what the emergence of streaming services like would mean for artists. In 2015, that debate is still going on, and it's even more heated. Now McCandless has created a new version of the infographic, updated for 2015. As before, it digs in to stats from various digital music companies, from the likes of Bandcamp, iTunes and Amazon that sell music, to streaming services: Spotify, Deezer, Apple's Beats Music, Rhapsody, and Tidal. Besides calculations for how much an artist can expect to earn from a single sale or stream, the infographic shows how many of those sales or streams they'd need to earn the US monthly minimum wage of $1,260. Some important caveats: these numbers apply to performing musicians, but they do not include publishing royalties for the songwriting. Plus, the most important factor in how much an artist signed to a label earns is the terms of their contract: some have good, fair deals. Others... less so. Averaging that out is also the reason why the figures here may not match those announced by the streaming services. For example, Spotify says that but Information Is Beautiful suggests that the average payment to an artist from the label portion of that is $0.001128 – this being what a signed artist receives after the label's share. Finally, the per-play figures for streaming service can be misleading, as they depend on how many (or few) users the service has. Beats may pay more per-stream than Spotify, but that's because it has relatively few users. Artists will be making a lot more money in aggregate from Spotify, and if Beats' user numbers grow, its per-stream payouts will come down. So this graphic isn't proof that one service is better for artists than another, in that sense. Information is Beautiful has included a metric of ""users per play needed"" – the little dots at the bottom right of each circle – to reflect this. Even so, it's a great conversation-starter. The full infographic is embedded below, while McCandless' other recent work can be found in his book. The infographic above was updated on 10 April 2015, correcting errors in the earlier version."
106	107	Spotify: five big challenges looming for the streaming music service 	"ts critics include Thom Yorke and Johnny Marr, but music streaming service has become an established industry fixture that poses a competitive threat to headline technology acts like Apple. will further excite US investors who are anticipating a flotation this year. Despite its detractors, Spotify’s growth confirms that the music-listening public likes the model of paying a monthly subscription – of £10, $10 or €10 – for unlimited access to tens of millions of tracks. The company has leapt from 24 million active users and 6 million paying subscribers in March last year and is the world’s biggest music subscription service. “We’ve had an amazing year, growing from 20 markets to 56 as people from around the world embrace streaming music,” said chief executive Daniel Ek in a statement. “Ten million subscribers is an important milestone for both Spotify and the entire music industry. We’re widening our lead in the digital music space and will continue to focus on getting everyone in the world to listen to more music.” Spotify also announced that its users have created 1.5bn music playlists; that Avicii’s Wake Me Up is its most-streamed song with 235m plays; and that David Guetta is its most-followed artist, with 5m fans subscribed to his updates on the service. The service now has a clear lead ahead of fellow music upstarts. Its rivals in the streaming music market include Deezer, which has 12 million active users and 5 million paying subscribers, and Rhapsody, which has 1.7 million paying subscribers around the world, split between its Rhapsody and Napster brands. But it is the bigger rivals, which have noted Spotify’s success, that pose the main threat. Beats Music in the US is not bigger – it launched in January – but its likely new parent is a problem. Beats Music’s owner, headphones firm Beats Electronic, is close to being acquired by Apple for $3.2bn (£1.9bn). Apple’s streaming music ambitions represent one of the biggest challenges to Spotify. Its iTunes Radio service – which streams personalised “stations” but does not allow users to choose individual songs unlike Spotify – is already available in the US and Australia with more countries, including the UK, expected to follow later this year. Meanwhile, YouTube is also expected to launch a subscription music service in the near future, although it is already the biggest online source of free streaming music. So Spotify may look good money for its mooted $4bn valuation in the wake of Wednesday’s figures, but it faces several key challenges to its business in the months and years ahead: Some prominent musicians don't like Spotify at all. in 2013, telling his peers that ""I feel like as musicians we need to fight the Spotify thing"", suggesting that the company is just another (unwanted) middleman in the music industry. ""All these fuckers get in a way, like Spotify suddenly trying to become the gatekeepers to the whole process. We don't need you to do it. No artists needs you to do it. We can build the shit ourselves, so fuck off."" David Byrne was more measured, but just as critical . ""It seems to me that the whole model is unsustainable as a means of supporting creative work of any kind,"" he wrote. ""What's at stake is not so much the survival of artists like me, but that of emerging artists and those who have only a few records under their belts."" There are various reasons some musicians don't like Spotify, although the company is something of a lightning rod for criticism of all streaming services. Some criticise the size of per-stream payouts compared to the money they receive for sales of CDs and downloads, or plays of their music on the radio. Others think that streaming funnels money towards the biggest stars and doesn't support emerging acts. And others simply distrust Spotify because major labels own a chunk of the business, and they don't think they'll get a fair share of advance payments made to those labels, as well as any profits if and when the company is either bought or floats on the stock market. Others are taking a more pragmatic – but still problematic for Spotify – approach of withholding their new albums until they've had a few months of sales on CD and download stores like Apple's iTunes. to adopt this approach, following Adele and Taylor Swift in previous years. Spotify has tried to tackle all this in several ways. It in December 2013 to explain how it calculates its payouts – including making it clear that it pays labels and publishers but can't make them more transparent about how they pass that money on to creators. It has also highlighted the success (in terms of streams and sales) of big artists like One Direction and Bruno Mars, whose last albums launched day-and-date on iTunes and Spotify, while launching new features to help artists sell merchandise and tickets from within its service. Spotify also has its supporters within the musician community. on Spotify in February, and defended the company from attacks by artists. ""Let’s not attack the platform: they’re making a lot of money, but they’re paying out a lot of money too,"" he said. ""It’s where the money is going to: the people who are collectively referred to as the rightsholders."" Meanwhile, Metallica and Pink Floyd – both formerly streaming music holdouts – have added their back catalogue to Spotify in recent times. Streaming music is a tough business, to say the least. Companies like Spotify pay out 70% of their revenues in royalties, spending the rest (and a lot more) on running their services, expanding globally and the other costs involved in a modern digital business. Spotify sees the $1bn that it has paid out to rightsholders since 2008 as a positive thing: a sign that it's adding value to the music industry. But that also means the company remains heavily lossmaking: €45.4m of net losses in 2011, €58.7m in 2012 and possibly more in 2013 – those figures haven't been announced yet. The argument in point one about whether Spotify is sustainable for artists is important, but so is the question of whether it is sustainable for itself. Thus far, the company has been fuelled by massive venture capital funding rounds – $537.8m so far, including a $250m round in November 2013. That valued Spotify at $4bn, with rumours of an IPO this autumn continuing to bubble away. Investors may not expect Spotify to be making a profit yet, but with no existing business in hardware (Apple, Beats, Sony, Microsoft) or advertising (Google, YouTube) to prop it up, the company's future depends on figuring out how to reach a much bigger scale with many more paying subscribers, managing its royalty commitments, running costs and investment in new features and countries. Note: renegotiating contracts to lower those royalties is one tactic, but a risky one given the artist-payouts controversies. In the US, streaming radio firm Pandora has been attracting even more heated criticism than Spotify, partly because it has been publicly lobbying to reduce the percentage of its revenues it has to pay out in royalties. 40m active users is a decent number, but it's not what Spotify needs. When the company launched its Spotify Artists website, it set out a target of sorts: 40m paying subscribers – which at its current conversion rate of 25%, would mean 160m active users. Four times its current size, in other words. Spotify has done a good job of appealing to early adopters: tech-savvy music fans. Its bigger long-term challenge is how to attract a much more mainstream audience to first use its service, then pay for it – this is a challenge facing every streaming service, obviously. Spotify and streaming is already truly mainstream in its native Sweden and nearby Norway, but there's lots of work to do to make this happen elsewhere in the world. It's likely to be a mixture of marketing and partnerships – the latter particularly focused on mobile operators and ISPs (often the same company, obviously) to promote Spotify to their customers, and perhaps to bundle its premium service in with monthly contracts, so it feels cheaper. Vodafone 4G in the UK is one example, and a recent deal with Sprint in the US another. Spotify and its rivals are all pursuing such partnerships aggressively, because they see them as an important way to both reduce the price (or perceived price) of a subscription music service, while raising awareness that they even exist in the first place. Appealing to a more mainstream audience is also about the product itself. Log on to Spotify (or, again, most of its rivals) and you'll see more than the ""search box"" that they've been accused of being in the past. Carefully-curated playlists based on genres, themes or moods, and recommendations of artists or songs you may like based on your listening habits, are to the fore. Spotify has made big strides in becoming a more accessible way to find music for people who don't want to spend that much time actually music. Those efforts – fuelled by competition from Beats Music, Deezer, Apple and others – will continue. Spotify is bigger than Deezer, bigger than Rdio, bigger than Beats Music and the rest of its direct rivals. But it has bigger 900lb gorillas to battle in the coming months and years. Spotify isn't the biggest on-demand streaming music service in the world: YouTube is, particularly among younger internet users. And YouTube is expected to launch its own streaming music subscription service this year. Then there's Apple. For now, the iTunes Store is mainly about buying downloads rather than playing streams. Mainly? Some albums are available to stream on iTunes before their official release, as an incentive to pre-order the download versions. There's also iTunes Radio, which is only available in the US and Australia so far, but is expected to launch elsewhere in the next few months. It's more about personalised ""stations"" of music based on your tastes, favourite genres or specific artists than Spotify's fully on-demand – play anything you like – service. But if Apple does buy Beats Music, the two will finally be head-to-head. Apple and YouTube (well, Google) are massive companies with deep pockets: formidable foes for a company like Spotify. Apple in particular already has proven clout in negotiating exclusives with big artists – Coldplay, the Black Keys and Beyoncé's latest albums aren't on Spotify but they all got big promotion on iTunes. If the streaming music world turns into a flurry of chequebook exclusive deals, Spotify could be at a disadvantage to these bigger beasts. Who, don't forget, own the two big platforms – iOS and Android – that have been such an important part of Spotify's growth so far. Every so often, Spotify is rumoured to be preparing to make a move into Netflix-style streaming video: TV shows and films. It hasn't happened yet, and it's fair to say the company has plenty on its plate expanding its music service around the world without trying to get into a different entertainment industry that has its own dominant players. Even so... there's an argument that the future of digital entertainment may move more towards people getting their content from fewer companies. Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Sony being the five that immediately spring to mind: all able to offer music, TV, films, e-books and games to customers from one place. Where does that leave Spotify – and for that matter Netflix too? This is a longer-term challenge, but Spotify's management team will already be thinking hard about what life might be like for a pureplay streaming music service in 5-10 years time. This doesn't necessarily mean Spotify should pile into video (and books, and gaming) as quickly as possible. It's about at least preparing the arguments for why people should still subscribe to a specialist music service in a potential world of digital jack-of-all-trades. "
111	112	What does Apple stand to gain from Dr Dre's Beats headphones? 	"Apple is , in a deal that would be the Cupertino-based company’s largest acquisition to date. But what does Beats offer Apple that the iPhone manufacturer can’t do itself? Beats is one of the most high-profile brands in headphones. The designs are big, flashy and bold; an excellent example of brand and style over substance, as Beats headphones demand a large premium for . Their sound generally does not match competing products from Bose, Sennheiser or a plethora of smaller manufacturers. Launched by the rapper Dre and and music producer Jimmy Iovine in 2008, the Beats brand headphones were first manufactured by Monster, then a boutique audio and cable manufacturer. The success of Beats can be put down to Dre and Iovine’s ability to market the brand. The duo used their high profile among hip-hop artists to ensure that Beats headphones appeared in every influential music video possible – which quickly launched them into the consciousness of the rap and hip-hop buying public. The genius behind Beats was to make wearing big, bulky and showy headphones cool again. Lots of manufacturers had ""cans"" – over-the-ear models – but until Beats came along and showed celebrities wearing them, they weren’t a fashion accessory in quite the same way that they are today. Beats shed Monster as a manufacturing partner at the end of 2012, building the headphones itself. Mobile phone manufacturer HTC paid $309m for a 50.1% controlling stake of Beats in 2011. The acquisition gave the Taiwanese firm exclusive rights to make smartphones with Beats branded audio systems, which included the company’s 2013 HTC One flagship smartphone which shipped with Beats audio - the DSPs (digital signal processors, which turn digital data into music) and audio amplifiers - inside. HTC then sold back half of its stake in Beats to the company for $150m in 2012, with Beats buying out the final 25.1% HTC stake in September 2013. In that time Beats launched a new range of headphones and portable speakers, designed and manufactured in house, and then in January 2014 the company launched Beats Music – a music streaming subscription service built upon the company’s acquisition of a similar service called MOG in 2012. In acquiring Beats, a deal that is currently still speculation – seem to suggest the is accurate – what Apple is buying, first and foremost, is a brand. This would mark the first time that Apple has bought a large brand that many consumers have heard of. Historically, Apple has bought much smaller, innovative companies for technology, products and talent, but they're in no way part of the mainstream public consciousness. Apple's previous biggest known acquisition was Anobit, an Israeli company with expertise in solid-state chips, for $390m in December 2011. Its - the ""digital voice assistant"" - though that was in 2010, well before the Siri name was publicly familiar. It will have also bought a marketing powerhouse. The double team of Iovine and Dre have significant sway in the music industry, and together have proved they have the ability to create a brand from nothing and bring it to the mass market in developed nations like the UK and US in the space of six years. Beats also has a history of clever, if somewhat unorthodox marketing strategies. Its beginning, with product placement in music videos was key, but a standout was the (alleged) circumvention of 2012 London Olympics sponsorship agreements that barred brands from being advertised during the Olympics that were not official Olympic sponsors. It's said Beats got around the ban by , who duly wore their brand new headphones walking out to events. At one point almost every swimmer in certain finals came walking out to compete wearing large Beats cans, presumably replacing whichever headphones they would have normally worn as part of their isolation and warm up strategies. Beyond the brand, Beats also poses a range of headphones and speakers, many of which are already sold in stores. Apple sells two models of its own headphones: the EarPods, which ship in the box with the iPhone, and the Apple In-Ear Headphones, which are more traditional in-ear “ ” costing £65. In purchasing Beats, Apple would then own seven lines of headphones, three lines of earphones and four lines of speakers. Apple, like all other smartphone manufacturers, is like the UK and US. At that point gaining new customers is difficult, and growing sales becomes difficult unless Apple can woo customers away from other mobile manufacturers. In some markets such as Japan, , saturation has led to price wars, fluctuating sales and fierce competition – which Apple is unlikely to want to face without a backup. Apple may see Beats as a way to expand its mobile device ecosystem beyond computing products like the iPhone, iPad and Mac computer line. Beats sits in an tangential market to smartphones. They are inherently linked because the smartphone powers most of what is listened to on the companies headphones, but they are an accessory or an addition to the smartphone and therefore something Apple can sell to people who already own a smartphone. In addition to the brand and hardware Beats produces, there is also the . Apple has the incredibly successful iTunes store, but its model is one where consumers buy music, rather than renting it under a subscription model. Downloads are slowing, while streaming services such as Spotify have shown that paying a monthly subscription for music and streaming it from a large library is a viable alternative. It is certainly eating into the bottom end of the music retail market. Apple launched its music streaming service in the US in 2013 – a free ad-supported service available to all iTunes users. iTunes Radio allows users to listen to pre-defined “stations” or to generate a playlist based on a single artist with songs by them, plus others. So far though it's only available in the US and Australia. Beats Music (also available only in the US and Australia) is a direct competitor to Spotify, offering both on-demand music streaming and a radio-like service, which combines algorithm and human curation to generate playlists based on artists or moods and events. The service has 20m songs available in its library, and also has the backing of both high-profile and independent artists, with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails acting as Beats Music chief creative officer. Beats Music also acquired Topspin Media, a company dedicated to a direct-to-fan model that gave music artists a direct relationship with fans circumventing recording labels. Beats Music is perceived as friendly to music artists in a way that other music services are not, especially Apple’s iTunes, which some of the music industry blames for the decline of revenues. With Beats Music, Apple would get another line into the music industry that made the original iPod and iTunes into a market leader. It also gives Apple access to both curation and music artist talent like Reznor and Beats Music’s Julie Pilat, who leads the music curation team, having previously been a broadcast radio music director. To say that it is unclear quite how Beats and Apple would fit is be an understatement. The news that the two were in acquisition talks has prompted head-scratching around the world. On the face of it, they're not a good business fit: iTunes Radio directly competes with Beats Music, the Beats brand status as expensive but average-sounding headphones does not match up with Apple’s premium-quality experience, and Apple’s brand in music and mobile technology far exceeds that of Beats. If confirmed, Beats would be the largest acquisition Apple has made to date, and while it will have certainly bought itself a powerful brand, it is difficult to see what justifies the large $3.2bn sum. Perhaps Apple has just bought another company with revenues in excess of $1bn and intends to leave it operating as a separate entity. But if so, that would be the first time it has done that, and is certainly uncharacteristic. Apple has refused to comment on the acquisition. Beats has yet to reply to request for comment."
114	115	Apple's iTunes Festival promises diversity in its eighth year 	Apple’s Festival has become a staple of the British music festivals season, with the livestreams of its annual month-long residency at London’s Roundhouse venue bringing it a global profile too. That’s even more the case in 2014, with set to be streamed to more than 100 countries, where fans will be able to watch the likes of Deadmau5, Kasabian, Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams and Kylie Minogue perform via various devices. As ever, tickets to attend the gigs are being distributed via a mixture of an online sweepstake and competitions run by media partners, from newspapers and radio stations to Twitter and Shazam. “This is our eighth year, and from the first year on, for us it was about diversity,” Oliver Schusser, senior director, iTunes International at told The Guardian, in an interview ahead of this year’s event. “It’s really a fully-curated month: we want to make sure we have some pop artists, some classical artists, jazz. Some well-established artists, and some up-and-coming artists that we really believe in. I’m really proud, because I think it’s as diverse as we can get.” The festival has become increasingly influential within the music industry, with a growing number of labels timing new releases and marketing campaigns around artists’ appearances at the event. In 2013, that included to most of the songs from her ARTPOP album; Justin Timberlake releasing his The 20/20 Experience - 2 of 2 album just after his headline set ended; and similarly-synchronised album releases from Arctic Monkeys, Avicii and Jack Johnson. “It happened already two years ago: all of a sudden this became a key part of everyone’s plan. Lady Gaga opened last year on the first, and that was the kickoff for her new project, and the same for Katy Perry at the end,” says Schusser. “It feels like this has become really a great part of everyone’s promo activity, from a label and manager and artist perspective.” You don’t get to be a senior director at Apple without being able to dead-bat questions about future announcements. Schusser deflects a question about the remaining two unannounced dates for this year’s festival, as well as the prospect of any alongside its gigs. Apple has been quietly increasing the ways it works with musicians and labels around the releases of new albums, though: for example, making full-album streams available through iTunes the week before release. The latest album was promoted through the use of “instant grat” tracks: seven of its songs could be downloaded early, over the days leading up to its official release, by fans who had pre-ordered it through iTunes. Schusser points out that Sheeran is also an example of a musician who first played the iTunes Festival in a support slot, before graduating to headline status – and then returning this year. “It’s about building a relationship with us. Ed Sheeran in particular, I’m proud of the campaign we ran up to his new album this year, but we’ve worked together for many years,” he says. The status of the album is currently a talking point within the music industry, most recently fuelled by , who suggested that “albums are edging closer to extinction... most people are not listening to albums. They are flicking through playlists.” Albums out, playlists in? It seems like a threat to iTunes, given the wider predictions of a move from downloads to streaming music, and the fact that Apple’s own streaming services – iTunes Radio and the recently-acquired Beats Music – are only available in a handful of countries. That said, Apple itself has often been accused of having helped get the album-destruction bandwagon rolling in the first place, by letting people buy individual album tracks digitally – as opposed to filesharing service Napster, which actually started that bandwagon, just without the “buy” part. Interestingly, while Apple waits to roll out its streaming services to battle Spotify, Deezer and other rivals, its iTunes strategy has seen it become almost one of the last bastions of the full-album format, sometimes who sold 829,000 copies of her last album in its first three days, and sometimes less so as with the , which hasn’t really taken off. “We were incredibly proud of the Beyoncé promotion, but it all starts with a great product. It’s a very strong album, with very strong videos: a really attractive package that was actually priced relatively highly,” says Schusser, in response to a question about whether it proved there’s life in the album yet. “I actually agree: it has made people think again about the future of the album. Creatively, we really believe in albums, but that doesn’t say we don’t believe in giving customers the choice to buy songs as they want. But as a creative concept, I think albums have actually been quite strong over the past year.” Apple also sees the global scale of iTunes as a key weapon for labels trying to make a splash with big albums. “We’re in 119 markets now: we spent a lot of energy in the last three to four years to expand, going from what used to be 23 markets to 119,” says Schusser. “That allows you to release your album at the same time in 119 markets, and that’s a huge opportunity that has never existed before, even if it’s not 100% the norm yet: the album release dates don’t exactly line up around the world.” That may be changing, with the music industry currently mulling – and, characteristically, arguing about – , that will potentially see new albums come out on Fridays, rather than Mondays (the UK) or Tuesdays (the US and Canada). What about that transition from sales to streams, though? A month-long music festival in September could be a great launchpad for Apple to launch iTunes Radio and Beats Music in the UK, at least, as well as other countries around the world. Will it? Schusser is politely unforthcoming. “Our focus is to make the festival better every year, and run a great event,” he says, in response to a question about whether the festival will host any marketing for Apple’s streaming services. A direct question on Beats Music and iTunes Radio launching in the UK is similarly dealt with: “There is nothing to talk about today. When we do have something to announce, we’ll be sure to give you a call.” Given the rumours of a 9th September unveiling of Apple’s next iPhone models, it’s possible that the company could use such an event to give more detail on its streaming music plans, then promote them at the concerts. For now, Apple’s emphasis is on streaming video of those gigs to iPhones, iPads, televisions and computers around the world: an impressive technical feat in itself, even at a time when other companies – Yahoo and Vevo for example – are following suit with their own livestreamed concerts. “We look at what people are doing out of interest, but it’s not like we’re comparing ourselves to any of the other activities. We are happy with the quality of the event, both for the people in the room as well as for the people at home,” says Schusser. “We do invest a lot in the technology: spending a lot of time, energy and R&D in making sure we have the right cameras, the best angles, the synchronisation between the cameras and the stage. It’s really a one-year project every time.” For up-and-coming British artists taking support slots on this year’s bill – including Jungle, Luke Sital-Singh, Foxes, Jess Glynne, MNEK and Wolf Alice – it’s an early chance to reach a global audience. “The support we can give the music industry includes exporting some of the talent we have seen here. We do it internally when we spot someone we really like,” says Schusser. “We can really promote up-and-coming British bands and artists in the US and everywhere around the world. It’s a fantastic opportunity.” 
138	139	UK sliding towards first bout of negative inflation in 55 years 	Britain is sliding towards its first bout of negative inflation in more than half a century, the has said, but strong economic growth should stave off the threat of a deflationary spiral. The slump in oil prices and falling food prices is likely to push inflation to zero in the second and third quarters of 2015, probably dipping into negative territory for one or two months this spring, the Bank said in its February inflation report. But the Bank also revised up its forecasts for growth in 2016 and 2017, helping push sterling to a seven-year high against the euro, with one euro worth 73.71p. The pound also rose 1% against the dollar to $1.5388 as investors bet on a rate hike coming sooner than expected, later this year or in early 2016. UK inflation was 0.5% in December, well below the Bank’s 2% target. Speaking as it published its latest quarterly inflation report, the Bank’s governor, , said: “It will likely fall further, potentially turn negative in the spring, and be close to zero for the remainder of the year.” The last time headline inflation was negative in Britain was March 1960, according to the closest comparable data from the Office for National Statistics. The Bank expects the slump in oil prices and falling food prices to keep inflation low in the short-term. However, lower oil prices – – are expected to significantly boost consumer spending. This in turn should fuel growth and push inflation higher over the medium term. “The combination of rising wages and falling energy and food prices will help houseshold finances and boost the growth of real take home pay this year to its fastest rate in a decade. This will support solid growth in consumer spending,” Carney said. He described the sharp fall in oil prices as “unambiguously positive” for the global economy and for the UK, and said the public should be prepared for an increase in borrowing costs. Rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009. “The most likely next move in monetary policy is an increase in interest rates. The message is clear,” Carney said. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital , said: “The Bank of England’s latest inflation report has confirmed that the monetary policy committee thinks that deflation is now on the horizon, but that this will be fairly short-lived. “With the MPC fairly relaxed about the prospect for deflation, we still think there is a reasonable chance of a hike before the end of this year.” Published alongside the inflation report was , explaining why inflation had missed the government’s targets. Carney said: “Inflation pressures could be greater if lower oil prices were to provide greater stimulus to global and domestic growth or if slack in the economy were to be absorbed more quickly than in the central projection. “If these risks materialise, it would be appropriate for Bank rate to increase more quickly than embodied in current market yields but the likelihood is that those increases would still be more gradual and limited than in previous tightening cycles.” Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: “One of the most notable changes to the Bank’s forecast is the upward revision to the inflation profile towards the end of the forecast horizon. “This reinforces our conviction that interest rate rises, while likely to be very gradual, will probably increase at a faster pace than the market expects. We expect the first hike to come in early 2016 and for rates to reach 1% by end-2016 and 1.5% by end-2017.” The Bank left its 2015 economic growth forecast unchanged at 2.9%, but raised its forecast for 2016 to 2.9%, up from 2.6% three months ago. It also raised its forecast for 2017 to 2.7% from 2.6%. Carney warned in his letter to Osborne that if low inflation persists for longer than expected and the global economy is weaker, the Bank stands ready to cut interest rates further and pump more money into the economy through quantitative easing. “To the downside the fall in near term inflation could be more persistent than the committee currently expects. In that case the MPC would need to provide more support to returning inflation to the target over the appropriate horizon.” One option would be an even more gradual increase in interest rates than the City expects but, Carney added: “The committee could also decide to expand the asset purchase facility or to cut Bank rate further towards zero.” The governor played down the risk posed to the UK by a potential Greek exit from the euro. “Would it have the same impact on the UK economy as it would have done in 2012? No.” He conceded the impact would be negative, but said the UK today would be better protected than it was three years ago, partly because the UK banking system is more resilient and because UK financial exposure to Greece was minimal.
139	140	London's Brent borough leads Britain for rising house prices 	"For years the borough of Brent was synonymous with Wembley stadium and Ken Livingstone's constituency when he was an MP. It included some of the capital's most deprived areas, and was once dubbed the drive-by-shooting capital of the UK. However, Brent residents, and more particularly those in the trendiest part of the borough, Queen's Park, woke on Wednesday to the fact that their small corner of north-west London last year witnessed Britain fastest rising house prices. Homes here outpaced the oligarch and banker hotspots of Chelsea, Westminster, and even Knightsbridge. Developers, foreign buyers, and a large number of families downshifting from the nearby and super-expensive Notting Hill area, have, according to agents, sent prices to hitherto unimaginable heights. Price increases in Queen's Park have made millionaires of thousands of residents. Nazir Shah, of Lewis Estates, in Queen's Park, said: ""It has been crazy in recent months, shocking. A couple of months ago we sold a two-bed flat that is due to complete on Friday for £560,000. If we put it back on the market today it would make £625,000, if not more. ""Houses that sold for £1.1m a few months ago are already worth £1.35m, and prices have been moving up so fast it's become very difficult to value houses. We've been asking the vendors what they hope to get, and unless their valuation is crazy, putting it on for that amount. Sealed bids are commonplace, with the winner often paying £15,000 to £20,000 over the asking price."" Across the road at the agents Queens Park Partnership, Alan Isaacs said the area had increasingly become the hot choice for London's well-off families spurred by its good transport links, wide tree-lined streets, park, and strong community. He said houses that sold for £155,000 in 1990 were now fetching in excess of £1.4m. Renting a house in the area now cost a minimum of £1,000 a week. Price increases in Queen's Park have sent a ripple through the borough, helped by the gentrification of nearby Kensal Rise and Willesden Green. Even Harlesden, once infamous for its shootings, is hugely on the up. ""If you're feeling brave now's the time to buy in Harlesden. It's only going one way,"" said one agent."
151	152	Oil price dips below $50 for first time since recession 	Brent crude dipped below the $50 a barrel mark on Wednesday for the first time since the great recession in 2009. Before a weak rally brought some relief to traders battered by six months of the declining price, the North Sea global benchmark slid more than 2% to $49.66. It later bounced back to just over $51 after data from the US Energy Information Administration showed stocks had run lower than thought last week. The late rally helped steady stock markets that have fallen heavily this week, with the FTSE 100 ending the day up 53 points at 6419. In New York, the was up 170 points. and Shell, which have both been battered by the recent fall in prices, recovered a little of their value while other energy stocks also made gains. The price of Brent crude has slumped from $116 a barrel in June, driven down by a glut in supply and shrinking demand caused by fears about the outlook for world economic growth. Analysts have also pointed to a flight of speculators who have taken cash out of the oil market as another reason for the drop in prices. James Hughes, the chief market analyst at Alpari, said: “Many will be asking just how much lower the oil price can go before some kind of stabilising effect kicks in. “However, after every $10 fall experts have been calling the end of the slide, but have seen it continue to drop like a stone.” Most oil producers have refused to cut production in order to stabilise prices. Saudi Arabia and its fellow members of the Opec cartel voted to maintain their 2015 production schedule at a meeting last month. The oil price came under sustained pressure once Opec ministers announced their decision not to cut supply. The US, which until recently was a major importer, sanctioned the export of light oil products just before Christmas from surpluses it has generated by fracking. This added to the amount of excess oil in the market. Hughes said: “Traders will be looking for the $40 level now as a base for the oil price, but after further comments from Saudi Arabia yesterday hinting there will be no move to curb output, no one would be surprised to see the price drop yet lower.” Several producers, including Russia, Venezuela and Nigeria need oil prices in excess of $100 a barrel to maintain their government finances without sinking into deficit. These so-called break-even levels illustrate the necessary tax revenues from oil production needed to support government spending. Venezuela and Nigeria are believed to be particularly vulnerable after depleting much of their reserves built up ahead of the price crash. Shippers, airlines and motorists stand to gain from the fall. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said last month that the slide in oil prices was a “net positive development” for the UK. George Osborne has fired a warning shot at energy companies, fuel retailers and airlines earlier this week, insisting they pass on the benefits of lower oil prices to their customers. With the cost of living expected to be a big election battleground, the Treasury is planning an investigation into whether lower oil prices are being adequately passed on to consumers by companies and industries linked to oil. The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise attacks from Labour, after the party leader, Ed Miliband, took on energy companies last year with his pledge to freeze energy bills for 20 months if he is elected prime minister this May. The price comparison site theenergyshop.com said British households were being overcharged by as much as £140 a year for energy as the big six gas and electricity suppliers refuse to pass on wholesale price falls.
155	156	Philips Fidelio M1BT review: great-sounding Bluetooth headphones 	The latest wireless M1BT headphones from Philips bring quality, balanced sound and great battery life to the compact, on-ear headphone market with very little in the way of compromise. The Philips Fidelio brand has long been known for quality headphones and speaker products, but the M1BTs mark its first move into Bluetooth headphones – a market which has rapidly expanded in recent years thanks to the vastly improved audio quality of new Bluetooth technologies like Bluetooth 4.0 and CSR's . The Philips M1BT Bluetooth headphones are a wireless variant of the well-received Fidelio M1 wired headphones, and as such match their look and feel almost exactly. With a compact but distinctively premium design, the M1BTs are very well built and feel robust enough to throw into a bag without having to worry about them too much. The headband is clad in a soft faux-leather, while the size adjustment has a reassuring resistance to it, ensuring that once sized correctly they say that way while on your head as you go about your travels. With soft, dense memory-foam ear cups, their on-ear configuration fits snuggly and comfortably while creating effective sound isolation, blocking out the hustle and bustle of the outside world. Depending on the size and shape of your head and your ears, you might find they pinch after a time as is the case with almost all on-ear headphones, but the M1BTs are some of the most comfortable I have ever worn. They are also light and slim enough not to be a burden while commuting; there's none of the scalp pain common with headphones. The left-hand ear cup sports a 3.5mm headphones jack for wired connections when at a desk or when the battery runs flat, while on the right-hand side there is a microUSB port for charging the headphones and the built-in music controls. Battery life on the M1BTs is rated at 10 hours of listening over Bluetooth, but in my testing I found that to be a significant underestimate. Connected to an aptX smartphone, I got more than 30 hours' listening, meaning that the M1BTs have more than enough playtime to get you through almost any listening scenario, and should power through at least 15 days of an hour-long commute to and from work, for instance. The Philips Fidelio range is well known for its decent, balanced sound quality and the M1BTs are no exception. Built for portable listening they reproduce smooth mids with relaxed treble, tight and punchy bass and decent, if not overly pronounced high notes. Their balanced sound profile will fit a wide range of musical genres, something particularly suited to listening while out and about. The M1BTs also articulate different sounds well for a compact portable set of on-ear headphones, allowing the listener to differentiate various instruments and sounds clearly within the audio track, while the soundscape is rather closed and direct as a consequence of the form factor. The M1BTs performance on Bluetooth is indistinguishable from wired, which is an achievement on the part of Philips. They support aptX, which provides higher sound quality over standard Bluetooth, but the drop was not noticeable when connected to devices that do not support aptX. In fact, the M1BTs sounded great whichever way you connected or used them, while Bluetooth signal strength was excellent with all devices tested including smartphones, tablets and computers, without any drop outs or interference. The M1BTs one area of weakness is the controls. Like most other Bluetooth headphones, they support wireless playback control of supported smartphones, tablets and computers over the Bluetooth AVRCP protocol. The music controls are mounted on the right-hand ear cup with a jog switch-type scheme, which for the most part moves and functions well enough. But Philips has tried to squeeze too many controls into the jog switch; it would be better suited to separate, dedicated buttons. The jog switch has to do everything. Flick up or down to adjust the playback volume. Press in once to pause or play. But you also have to press in twice to skip forward one track, or three times to skip back to the track start. This is fiddly: it's easy to change the volume by mistake while trying to skip, and if you click too fast it isn't noticed, while if you click too slowly you'll give the wrong instruction.  Given that the headphones are not short of space on either ear cup, the skip track buttons could easily have been given dedicated controls, making it a frustrating omission if you happen to be listening to an album with a few bum songs, for instance. The £250 price places these at the bottom of the high-end price bracket for wireless headphones. They're premium, though the jog switch feels a little cheap and plasticky compared to the rest of the build. The Philips M1BT Bluetooth headphones are compact, robust and sound great for general listening. Their long battery life means that they can go the distance without repeated charging, while the strong, good quality audio performance over Bluetooth means there is no tradeoff for forgoing the wire. If the battery runs out, or you need to listen to something without Bluetooth, the integrated cable is there and does not affect their sound.

161	162	Lady Gaga's manager Troy Carter earmarks $75m fund for tech startups 	"Troy Carter may be best known for his role as Lady Gaga's manager, but he's an increasingly prominent figure in the world of technology startups, having invested in firms including Spotify, Dropbox, Uber, Songza, Summly and other startups through his fund. Now Carter is preparing to ramp up his investment strategy, with PandoDaily reporting that he is to chip in to seed and Series A funding rounds for tech startups. Carter told the Silicon Valley site that his strategy will be ""opportunistic"" rather than focused on specific sectors: ""I didn't want to get hung up on a specific investment thesis just for the sake of a thesis."" Music may still be a big part of AF Square's plans, though, judging by Carter's comment that ""we need great minds around music: if entrepreneurs aren't incentivized, music is going to be stuck in the dark age"". Carter has been a longtime backer of Spotify, in terms of moral support as well as his financial investment. While some prominent artists and managers have worried about the amount of money they get paid for every stream on Spotify and its rivals, back in 2011 . ""What we're looking to do is not just about selling the CD or the digital file. It's how many people can we get the music to. How many people can experience it?"" he said at Facebook's f8 conference that year. ""If it was up to me, I'd give away the next album and put it on every handset that I can put it on, to get that scale."" That hasn't quite come to pass, but Carter is heavily involved in the decision to as well as a traditional album when it comes out on 11 November. Described earlier this year as ""a musical and visual engineering system that combines art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community"", the ARTPOP app has since been , dampening down some of the hype around it. Troy Carter's investments also include Backplane, the US startup that powers Gaga's Little Monsters web community. Together with Justin Bieber's manager Scooter Braun, he epitomises a growing sense among music industry figures that investing in technology may be just as important as investing in artists in the coming years. ""I think the idea of having an application is the future,"" he . ""People don't buy horses to ride around any more for transportation. I just think the world changes. As a business, we have to make the proper adjustments."" That applies to artists too. In response to a question from PandoDaily about Thom Yorke's recent attacks on , Carter gave a pithy response: ""Guess what – people had gripes when the CD came along."""
166	167	Aldi extending UK HQ for £70m 	" is spending £70m expanding its Warwickshire headquarters as it prepares to nearly double its stores in the UK by 2021. The German discounter has about 530 outlets in the UK and plans to have 1,000 in six years' time. Last year, the company opened 42 stores, with 54 more launching this year – creating 7,000 new jobs. Aldi is to lease a second building to accommodate additional staff until 2017 when it expects to complete the extension of its existing headquarters in Atherstone. The move comes as Aldi and fellow discount retailers including Lidl, B&M Stores and Poundland are driving dramatic change in the grocery market as their combination of low prices and convenience tempts shoppers away from big supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Aldi, which first arrived in the UK in 1990, now controls nearly 5% of the grocery market, up from 3.7% a year ago, putting it almost in line with the upmarket grocer Waitrose. Sales are rising by around 30% according to data from Kantar Worldpanel, the market analysts, as more than half of Britons now buy at least some goods at a discount store. Roman Heini, group managing director of Aldi UK, said: ""In addition to opening new stores, we are making strong investment in our behind-the-scenes operations. This ensures we can successfully grow, while keeping our customers at the heart of everything we do."""
169	170	UK house prices hit new record as London average breaks £500,000 	" hit a fresh record high in July after surging by 11.7% over the last year, according to official figures. The average price of a British home stood at £272,000 following three consecutive months of double-digit price rises. Most of the UK's regions saw house values jump above their pre-financial crisis peaks, fuelling concerns that much of the UK's recovery has been fuelled to a large degree by a booming housing market. Scottish house prices soared to a record high, while the east Midlands, the West Midlands and the south-west joined London, the east and the south-east in having price levels higher than their pre-financial crisis peaks of 2007/08, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. values in London continue to rise faster than the rest of the country, recording a 19.1% year-on-year jump, and taking the average property price in the capital to £514,000. But the pace of growth slowed from 19.3% in June and hinted at a cooling off in activity during the summer compared to the hectic pace of growth in the same period last year. Several surveys have showed a slowing in activity as a mix of low wage rises and sky-high prices restrict buyers from obtaining mortgages. Emphasising how difficult it has become for new entrants to the market, the ONS said prices paid by first-time buyers in July were 13.5% higher on average than the same month last year. For owner-occupiers moving home, prices increased by 10.9% for the same period. On a month-on-month basis, property values increased by 1.6% across the UK between June and July. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the consistent double-digit price rises will ""add to worries that the property market poses a key risk to financial stability"". He said there will be officials in the Bank of England, which is the chief financial regulator, who fear ""that macro-prudential tools may be insufficient to cool the housing market without an accompanying rate hike"". Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ""Stretched house prices to earnings ratios, the prospect that interest rates will start to rise before long and tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders will likely have some limiting impact on buyer interest. ""Even so, with the economy seen holding up pretty well going forward, employment high and rising, consumer confidence elevated and earnings growth likely to improve (particularly in 2015), and with housing supply still tight in a number of areas, house price growth seems unlikely to fall away."" Connells Survey & Valuation said its own survey of activity in August showed a drop in transactions over the last year. It said the total number of valuations was 13% higher than in July, though 4% fewer when compared with August 2013. Spokesman John Bagshaw said: ""August has seen a bounce back from a particularly quiet July. Yet this is still quieter than a year ago. That's partly because August 2013 was particularly strong – an exceptional month for comparison, being the first time where it was clear the property market was moving into sustained positive territory."""
170	171	Why iOS 7 is making some users sick 	"Apple's new mobile operating system for the and iPad, iOS 7, is stark and minimal, yet dynamic. It makes frequent use of zoom and slide animations; the home screen boasts parallax, with icons apparently floating above subtly animating wallpaper. And it's making people sick. Triggers and symptoms vary, but TidePool experience is not uncommon. A self-professed power-user, she frequently switches apps; but on iOS 7, this has caused headaches and feelings associated with motion sickness. ""I now have to close my eyes or cover the screen during transitions, which is ridiculous,"" she told The Guardian, adding that there's nowhere to hide: ""It's not apps that affect me, but accessing them. Tap a folder and the view zooms in. Tap an app and it's like flying through the icon and landing in that app's micro world — and I'm getting dizzy on the journey there."" This wasn't the case under iOS 6. That system wasn't devoid of triggers (full-screen slide transitions being fairly common), but zooming was minimal and parallax was absent, as were gamified animation effects such as subtly shifting and sliding balloons in Messages. The same minimal effect is true of stock Android and , which lack triggering animations and effects as dynamic and aggressive as those in iOS 7. The severity of the jump from iOS 6 to iOS 7 means some organisations dealing with such motion-sickness problems are recommending that people with such conditions don't upgrade their iOS devices. A number of affected users have reportedly switched iPhones that had already been upgraded to iOS 7 for models running iOS 6. Reactions to screen-based systems — especially those utilising 3D effects — aren't new. Cynthia Ryan, executive director of the , says 3D effects can cause ""intense nausea, dizziness and vertigo"", sometimes from general vision problems, but also from visual-vestibular conflict. She added symptoms ""manifest more severely if a viewer already has a disorder of the vestibular system"". The vestibular system is what gives us our sense of balance and sense of spatial awareness; it's dependent on three mutually orthogonal fluid-filled canals in the inner ear. But when the vestibular system and visual system come into conflict, the effect can be distressing. , professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster, says visually-induced motion-sickness often arises from ""the induction of perceived self-motion while at the same time the vestibular system and somatosensory systems signal that the body is in fact static"". The number affected is hard to pin down. Golding says that ""visually induced motion sickness"" has ""affected a relatively small proportion"" - less than 5% - of the population, compared with other stimuli such as from boats (sea sickness), cars/coaches (car sickness), etc. But prevalence may be much higher in some clinical grpoups with vestibular disease."" Ryan says: ""These symptoms manifest even more severely if a viewer already has a disorder of the vestibular system. An estimated 69 million US adults aged 40 and over — 35% of all Americans — experience vestibular system dysfunction."" Similar symptoms can also arise from neurological conditions that cause central dizziness. , an independent iOS developer, thought it made sense that those with such conditions ""would find some parts of the new iOS 7 interface uncomfortable or disorienting,"" because it ""makes more extensive use of animations — and those animations are more pronounced"". The problem for those suffering is twofold: first, many other people refuse to believe a problem exists; secondly, there's no fix. ""We're often contacted by people affected by moving images on screens, but people are affected in different ways — what's a problem for one person may not be for another,"" explained Natasha Harrington-Benton, director of the , a UK charity for peopel with disorders causing dizziness or balance disorders. ""But these disorders can be extremely debilitating, despite there being no visible symptoms"". , a podcaster and writer about hidden disabilities, suggests there was a ""lack of awareness"" about such issues: ""The words 'dizziness' and 'vertigo' don't strike fear into people, but those living with severe cases are in ongoing angst awaiting the next unwarranted attack"". The lack of a solution is the bigger problem. Apple provides a ""Reduce Motion"" option within the iOS 7 Settings app, but it is poorly labelled; it merely disables the parallax effect, but doesn't stop zooming or sliding. did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Which for now, leaves affected people on their own. Golding's suggestions to those affected include to ""rest often"", avoid situations which reduce peripheral visual clues which give the correct information the person is static (in other words, don't hold your to your nose), or ""just not use the device"". Those might suit some, but aren't practical if you're reliant on mobile devices. What's surprising is Apple's apparent blind spot regarding balance and related concerns. Gemmell said: ""Apple is more committed to accessibility than any other platform provider I know of."" This is borne out by the software's otherwise plentiful aids for people with vision, hearing and motor-control issues. However, technology writer Kirk McElhearn quesions whether Apple is . He told the Guardian: ""If Apple wants to truly cater to users with disabilities, it must look more closely at which features cause difficulties, make more effort to listen to users who find them hard to use, and enable them to be more comfortable"". Christina said Apple should start by acknowledging the issue and ""initiating an open dialog with those affected, developers, and Apple's own accessibility team"". The company must, she said, ""narrow in on what's adversely affecting people and ensure features can be disabled"". Gemmell says he is ""sure suitable options to more comprehensively disable motion will be forthcoming"". In the meantime, he recommended those affected send an email to accessibility@apple.com, succinctly stating which animations are problematic and requesting the means to disable them. In the meantime, developers can also do their part. With app creators often following Apple's lead, it's perhaps inevitable the short-term will see yet more animation in iOS 7. Gemmell urges developers to ""consider all categories and ability levels of user, and design interfaces judiciously""; they should enable users to disable anything that ""could be annoying or intrusive"", and UI effects should ""have a useful function, such as showing context, hinting about functionality, or demonstrating transition, rather than being purely decorative"". With the latest update to the popular calculator app , developer James Thomson has recognised the accessibility concerns, and provided the option to ""remove full-screen transitions throughout the app"". But he says= he'd sooner see Apple add this at system level, :so individual developers don't have to"". Gemmell hopes Apple and developers alike would react accordingly regarding animations and transitions, simply because it's the right thing to do: ""Accessibility affects everyone, and devices should be usable in all situations, by as many people as possible. Designing for accessibility levels the playing field, and increases the utility of devices for everybody."""
172	173	Ed Miliband: Cameron’s wage call is desperate bid to hide living cost failure 	 has poured scorn on the prime minister’s calls for wage rises by condemning the Tories for waiting until the general election year to address “the worst cost of living crisis in more than a century”. The Labour leader said people would be “choking on their cornflakes” at morning headlines reporting David Cameron’s appeal to businesses to share windfall profits from . In a speech to the Fabian Society on Saturday morning, Miliband said the prime minister was seeking to disguise his repeated failure to maintain or increase average wages in the face of rising costs. Miliband, whose party in most polls, said: “This is someone who has spent months and years telling us there was no cost of living crisis, and then if there ever was one, it had been fixed. You couldn’t make it up. Five years of denial, complacency and failure on living standards, and less than four months before an election, he claims to have woken up to the problem. “You can’t wipe out five years of failure on living standards with pre-election pleading. You can’t magic away people being £1,600 a year worse off by trying to take credit for falling oil prices.” Miliband’s claims over the prime minister’s failure to deal with stagnating wages and increasing prices had been dealt a blow last week with the news that inflation was at its lowest rate since 2000. The slide mirrored similar declines across the world in response to the falling price of oil. Miliband, however, confirmed during his speech that the so-called cost of living crisis would remain a central plank of his general election campaign. Next week, a major report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation is expected to give him further ammunition by exposing the deteriorating prospects of families with children since 2010. Claiming that the election in May presented the “biggest choice for a generation”, Miliband told a friendly audience: “For the first time since the 1920s, working people will be worse off at the end of a government than they were at the start … “Week after week, month after month, year after year, this government has shown a tin ear for what is really going on. “They have denied the cost of living crisis. They have been woefully out of touch with the daily struggles of families. They have rubbished the idea that people are worse off.” The Tories’s economic plans were represented as classic “trickle down” economics by the Labour leader in a well-received speech. Miliband said the country needed a new plan under which the deficit would be cut but public services would not be “shredded”. He said: “The Tories’ governing mission is this: Reduce government to its very core, cut services to the bone, give huge tax cuts to the very wealthiest and let powerful interests have things all their own way, and then sit back and hope the country will somehow succeed. But it has failed.” He also rejected the language of the UK Independence party and those on the right of the Conservative party, by speaking of the benefits of immigration to the British economy while pledging that wages of British workers would not be allowed to be unfairly undercut by those coming from abroad. He said: “Immigration makes us stronger, richer and more powerful as a nation. “But making immigration work for everyone and not just a few means people should contribute before they claim and we should never, ever allow companies to undercut wages and conditions of workers here by paying slave wages to those brought in from overseas.” Miliband also criticised the prime minister for his failure to commit to TV debates during the general election campaign, claiming Cameron was desperate because he “knows he has failed”. “That’s one of the reasons he is running from debates. He is neither proud of his record nor confident about his plans for the future,” he said. “Why did the chicken cross the road? To avoid the TV election debates,” he added to the applause of the hundreds of delegates at the conference.
181	182	Siri flaw leaves Apple playing 'whack-a-mole' with iOS 7 security bugs 	"Siri, the iPhone's voice control system, is at the root of a new lockscreen vulnerability which grants full access to the phone application. The hack, demonstrated by Israeli security researcher Dany Lisiansky, involves the use of Apple's voice-controlled digital assistant Siri on an iPhone's lockscreen. Siri can be used to initiate a FaceTime call allowing hackers to invoke a security glitch in the iOS 7 software to access the phone app. The hack requires two phones: the one to be hacked is used to initiate a call over Apple's Facetime system, which the receiving phone answers and then ends. That then leads via a series of actions on the first phone to the phone app. An attacker can then see a user's call history, contacts, and initiate answerphone calls. They can make calls, and send emails by initiating a ""send contact"" message and then altering it. ""This isn't quite as serious as some of the other iPhone security flaws that have been exposed in the past, because it doesn't grant access to other apps apart from the phone app,"" said Graham Cluley, an independent expert on IT security.  iPhone users can protect themselves from this latest vulnerability by deactivating Siri access on the lockscreen – found in the Settings app under the Passcode lock screen. Apple did not respond to a request for comment before publication. The company previously released a patch for another lockscreen security found in the initial release of iOS 7 . Questions about Siri's security   right from its launch in October 2011, because when active from the lockscreen it allows actions such as accessing calendars and sending emails even while the iPhone is locked. Cluley says: ""It just seems crazy that locking your phone doesn't entirely lock it down. ""A feature that enables access to any function of the phone while locked should not be enabled by default. It shows Apple's focus is on features rather than security."" Hackers have discovered security flaws in almost every major iOS release, including in the , which   including photos, email, Twitter and Flicker accounts. ""It's like Apple's playing security flaw whack-a-mole right now,"" Cluley said. ""A phone's operating software is very complex, involving many millions of lines of code, but it's because Apple's iOS garners much more attention than other platforms that these flaws are found. ""Hackers everywhere are having fun and gaining kudos for finding these flaws – should be hiring these guys to test its software,"" Cluley concluded. Apple's within days of its release by Germany's Chaos Computer Club – though nobody has yet shown whether fingerprint data can be extracted from the phone."
185	186	Chile’s Arturo Vidal looks beyond Spain to winning World Cup 	t the four years ago Chile faced Spain in the final round of group matches knowing that a win would almost certainly eliminate Vicente del Bosque’s men. On Wednesday afternoon, at the Maracanã, history will repeat itself. As things turned out in South Africa in 2010, Spain won 2-1 and both countries qualified for the knockout stages. This time round a win for Chile would all but confirm their presence in the last 16, while almost certainly eliminating the world champions. opened this tournament in typical barnstorming style, grabbing an early two-goal lead and, despite Tim Cahill’s header, they ended up beating Australia 3-1. That was in stark contrast to Spain’s thrashing by Holland and those results have left Spain’s future in Chile’s hands again. Arturo Vidal has been a key component in Chile’s rise to something approaching the status of third-best team in South America, behind Brazil and Argentina. The Juventus midfielder, 27, helped his country to the semi-finals of the 2007 Under-20 World Cup, he played in South Africa, where they lost in the last 16 to Brazil, and now the man with 55 caps has grander ambitions in this tournament beyond simply exacting revenge on . “We have our style and we will keep to it. We keep working in the same way and we’re not going to change that. We hope to play Spain and get all three points. If that eliminates them, so be it,” Vidal said. “We came to Brazil with the hope of becoming world champions and for that to happen you have to get through different stages and past your rivals.” Despite Chile’s and Spain’s differing fortunes last Friday, Chile’s manager, Jorge Sampaoli, has made sure that his men are not complacent, and Vidal added: “We have played several times against Spain but every game is different. We have watched those matches and we have analysed the mistakes we made. “They were friendly matches, though. We can only compare with the match played in South Africa but still that was different.” Sampaoli is also likely to tweak his line-up, with Gary Medel in the middle of a defensive three and with a five-man midfield, as Chile prepare for an onslaught. Vidal did not exactly cover himself in glory against Australia. He helped Juve win Serie A but had a knee operation last month and has been playing catch-up since for fitness. That may have explained his substitution after an hour against Australia, although not his reaction. By the dugout, the man nicknamed The Warrior kicked out at a water bottle. He swiftly realised the error of his ways. “Nobody likes to be off the pitch,” he said. “I always want to play. But, if I’m not playing, I support my team-mates from the bench. The other day something bad happened and I apologised to my teammates.” There will be no need for apologies should he help guide Chile past Spain.
192	193	iPhone 5s review: Apple shows its touch 	"pple did it differently this time: it released two phones, not just one. In a world where Samsung seems to release that many each week, and Chinese makers of low-cost Android phones are scrambling over each other for scraps of market share, takes what you could call a stately approach to this ""release"" stuff. Even so, notice what it hasn't done. The screens aren't bigger. There's little concession to cost. And, in fact, there are plenty of people in line for upgrades, or who are still using phones of all sorts whose screens are smaller than the 4in of the 5, 5c and 5s - just look around. For them, Apple has something to lure them: fast connections, a simple interface, and really great usability. Apple calls this its ""most forward-looking"" phone. What's it got to offer? A 64-bit dual-core chip, a fingerprint reader that really works, a much better camera (and dual flash) and an intriguing coprocessor - apparently for motion detection. Unlike the iPhone 5c, the 5s ( , apparently) is the same template as the iPhone 5: metal, chamfered edges. It's not on sale in black - possibly because that colour shows up every little ding - but instead in ""gold"", silver and ""space grey"". There are pricey leather cases, though I don't think they add anything useful. As with the 5c, the 5s does all the LTE bands. Depending what you do with it, you can get than the 5c - the M7 coprocessor can take over from the A7 CPU if it's sitting motionless with no wireless networks in sight. (Which usually means it's in, say, a metal locker or similar Faraday cage.) is rapid - I've been very impressed by this aspect of the iPhone. Given that its normal battery life, if you use it intensively for a few hours a day, is 16 hours at best, being able to pick up quick charges makes a big difference. And to those who say ""replaceable batteries!"" I say ""external power packs"", such as the Mophie Juice range. It's the fingerprints, isn't it? You wanted to know if the fingerprints work, and whether they're beamed back to the NSA. First of all: training the phone to accept a fingerprint is a doddle. It takes about 30 seconds of pressing your digit onto the home button in various orientations before you're declared a signed-up user. You can enrol up to five prints, and delete them as you like. If like me you've got a long passcode protecting your phone (a four-digit passcode isn't really enough; every extra digit makes cracking it ten times slower), then unlocking it quickly becomes tedious - moreso when you hurry and miss a digit. (Though iOS 7's use of the whole screen for the unlock buttons, compared to iOS 6's half-screen, makes miscues less common.) The fingerprint unlock? It just works. Again and again. Wake the phone up with a press of the home button, then rest your finger on it, wait a second - and you're in. I've tried fingerprint scanners on desktop computers (see review from May 2008). They were frustrating - always in the way. Apple has the advantage of faster processors, but even so the simplicity of this feature is remarkable. And Touch ID is just a brief obstacle. Now, to address our post-Snowden paranoia, is the NSA able to reach in and grab your fingerprints? A first question might be ""why would it want to, when you leave your fingerprints all over the place, and gave them to US border control if you visited it in the past decade?"" But on the basis that it just , what's stored is an encrypted hash of a mathematical representation of your prints; it's retained in what Apple calls a ""Secure Enclave"" of the chip. Apple says that isn't backed up or sent off the device. As a colleague remarked, if Apple had introduced this six months ago, everyone would have been cooing; now, everyone cooks up conspiracy theories. It's notable how none of those have attached to Android's own biometric system, Face Unlock, which apparently can be fooled with a picture from Facebook. ""That's because nobody uses it,"" came a suggestion from Twitter. By contrast, people will use Touch ID. A lot. Some have indicated that that's why they're getting the 5s over the 5c. It's supremely convenient, and I suspect that once Apple feels that people have regained confidence in these systems, it will become available to more payment methods than just its own App Store. (You can buy iTunes and App Store content, though I wasn't able to do this; Apple said it was a bug in a pre-production product.) I do expect that we'll see companies trying to imitate this in the near future (LG put out a phone with a fingerprint reader recently; not much has been heard). Then we'll realise just how well Apple has set this up. This question has been . Clearly, Apple sees a need to move in that direction, rather than to more cores (the A7 is dual-core; Samsung is offering eight-core 32-bit phones). The Camera app is designed for the Instagram generation (there are filters galore), but also adds two extra elements. Last year gave us Panorama (now available throughout Android). Now there's ""Burst mode"" for stills, where you hold the shutter button and get 10 frames per second. Let go, and you're presented with the phone's choice of the best picture. (Though the other shots are still there in its library, and can be retrieved for selection.) It's good at this. Compare it to other smartphone cameras, where you have to wade through a gigantic menu of never-used options, and you can see Apple has this right. (Motorola's MotoX also has this feature - which is laudable.) There's also a dual LED flash, offering two colours, which are mixed to balance against the prevailing lighting - so if you're under fluorescent light, it will add more yellow to give a better white balance. Here's the 5c photo (no dual flash): And here's the 5s photo (with dual flash) No other top-end smartphone has this, though Samsung's new Galaxy Note 3 phablet does. On the video camera, you can swipe to a setting where you shoot slo-mo video at 120 frames per second: the editing process is simple (you drag some sliders around the point you want to be slowed). Again, it's not the first to offer slo-mo; but it is to make it simple to enable and edit. This, and the Burst mode, are where those who complain that Apple offers ""limited"" functionality miss the point. There's no use having every function under the sky available if it takes you valuable time to find it. Slo-mo, Burst mode, Panorama, square shots (for Instagram) - they're all located within a swipe of each other. No menus; no stabbing at a faraway button. It's the difference between enjoying using the device, and being frustrated by it. The introduction of the M7 coprocessor, which is able to monitor the phone's movements (so that it can do health monitoring, for example, or tell when you're in a car and where you're heading) seems like Apple offering us a little peek into its future plans. Movement? Low-demand processors? What can it be about? If the 5s is forward-looking, this might be something that it's looking to make more in the shorter term. I wouldn't be surprised if the M7 turns up in another Apple product soon. The 5s is typical Apple: it's got top-end characteristics, at a top-end price. But with that you get really good implementation of complex problems. Fingerprint unlocking has seemed like a great idea for ages, but nobody could make it work well (Motorola tried it on the Atrix in 2011; it frustrated users). Apple has it nailed. Different camera modes are an obvious feature which smartphone makers have added with abandon (HTC's One has 13 camera options you get to the ""Camera options"" tab, which has another six options). Apple has added useful ones, but kept the clutter away. If the 5s is forward-thinking, it's clearly looking at a world where we use fingerprints to buy stuff, and our phones serve us simply rather than entangling us in useless choices. I liked the iPhone 5 last year; the iPhone 5s just shows that you can improve on it."
195	196	Vince Cable asks banks to reduce size of mortgages they offer 	"The business secretary, , has intervened to ask banks to reduce the size of the mortgages they offer amid concerns of an overheating housing market. Ministers have requested that the Bank of England do more to press banks to accept a new cap on loans of three and a half times the applicant's income. Speaking on Thursday, the business secretary said he had been appalled by the size of the loans being handed out in some cases. ""It is crucially important that the banks don't throw petrol on the fire, and traditionally most of us who been through housing booms in the past have recognised that a stable level is about three, three and a half times people's income,"" he told the Today programme. ""This is the key area that the Bank of England has now got to operate in, to make sure that this boom in house prices in the south of England doesn't destabilise the whole economy. ""I don't want anybody to suffer [but] we have got to make sure that the boom that is currently taking place in prices doesn't get out of control. The problem is that the further prices go up, the fewer people can get into the market. And certainly in the parts of London I represent we are getting families on middle income who can't dream of getting a house under the present conditions, and so the market does need to be stabilised."" His intervention came before the Mansion House speech on Thursday by the chancellor, George Osborne, in which he will call for new housebuilding measures, especially on brownfield sites. His intervention comes after a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found that the number of inquiries from new homebuyers had fallen to its lowest since February 2013, suggesting that the housing boom could be cooling. The coalition is aware it is vulnerable on the issue of housing and is facing intense pressure over rising house prices in the south-east, mainly due to a lack of supply but also fuelled by demand subsidised by the government. Cable has fought innumerable battles to increase government funding for social housing, but has faced a disagreement on the extent to which councils and housing associations should borrow to build. Figures published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) on Thursday showed how borrowers were stretching their salaries to raise enough money to get on the housing ladder. In April, first-time buyers across the UK took on mortgages that were 3.42 times their salary, and worth 83% of the value of the property they were buying. Only in December 2013 have first-time-buyer income multiples been higher, although as the property market reached its last peak they were up at 3.39 times salary. The CML figures showed that movers were also taking on large commitments, with typical borrowing in April at 3.03 times salary, compared with 2.87 the previous year. The average size of a first-time-buyer mortgage reached its highest level on record, rising to £121,500 from £118,750, in March. At the same time the typical income of a first-time-buyer household increased to £37,000 from £35,704, also the highest average income on record. The most recent data for London showed first-time buyers were taking out mortgages worth 3.83 times their salaries. Deposits from parents and the fact that buyers in the capital are slightly older, at an average of 32 when they take their first loan, compared with 29 across the UK, meant that loan-to-values in London were lower, at 75%. The government on Wednesday published new figures on affordable housing showing nearly 200,000 homes had been delivered since April 2010. The housing minister, Kris Hopkins, said 41,654 affordable homes had been started in the year to March 2014 – 15% more than in the previous year. It said the government had delivered 445,0000 new homes since April 2010. In contrast, between 1997 and 2010 the amount of social housing had dropped by 420,000, the government said. Some mortgage specialists challenged Cable's intervention. The vice-president for mortgage insurance at Genworth, Simon Crone, said: ""There is still a gulf between April's 17% average first-time-buyer deposit and the 5-10% deposits that were the norm throughout the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. ""There is clearly room for some fine-tuning of 'Help to Buy 2', as the £600,000 ceiling on purchases is far higher than is needed to support aspiring first-time buyers. But today's Council of Mortgage Lenders figures suggest that any moves to significantly limit the scheme may have dire consequences and add to the difficulties that have blighted this part of the market since the recession. It remains a long-term issue that demands a long-term solution from government in partnership with the private sector."" The head of research at the property firm Hamptons International, Johnny Morris, said it was too early to call for caps on income multiples. He said: ""First we need to see the impact of stricter affordability rules recently introduced through the Mortgage Market Review. Lenders are already aware of the risks associated with deteriorating affordability and the increased vulnerability of highly geared borrowers. ""The numbers of mortgage applications failing lenders' tests has been increasing according to the Bank of England's credit conditions survey, and looking ahead there is a clear expectation that affordability terms and conditions will bite much harder."""
209	210	Mortgage loans to be capped by Bank of England – but why? 	"The chancellor is saying that he will give the the power to cap the size of mortgage loans as a share of a borrower's income or the value of the house. Several months of headlines about runaway house prices have forced the chancellor into action. According to Nationwide while other indices are all showing sharp rises. London has been driving the boom, with an average annual price rise of 18%, but there are increasing signs that buyers are having to stretch themselves to buy in other parts of the country too. The International Monetary Fund has been scrutinising the housing market in the UK and called on the Bank of England to act ""early and gradually"" to avoid a housing bubble. Among the concerns of the IMF is that policymakers are also facing the prospect of having to sanction a first rise in interest rates in almost six years – a move which could put additional pressure on borrowers who have been enjoying low mortgage rates. According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, first-time buyers are typically borrowing 3.4 times their household income to get on the housing ladder, while movers are taking on loans of just over three times their salary. That's the median – so half are borrowing more. And the average disguises big regional differences: in London the median is 3.8 times salary, while in Northern Ireland it is 2.9. Some borrowers have been taking loans that are more than five times their salary. Around 2.6% of Royal Bank of Scotland's lending in London is at more than five times salary and above £500,000. Figures from the Bank of England show that in the first three months of 2014 almost 12% of lending was based on four or more times a single income, and 27% was based on three or more times joint earnings. Loan to values – the proportion of a property's cost that the borrower takes as a mortgage – have been creeping up but remain below the levels seen in the mid-90s and the run-up to the last crash. The median LTV among first-time buyers now stands at 83%. In London, LTVs are lower than the national average because of the monthly cost of repaying a big loan. New buyers in London typically borrow just 75%. Yes – since April banks and building societies have been required to carry out tough checks before they offer mortgages to prevent a return to the reckless lending seen in the run-up to the crash. These involve scrutinising applicants' income and outgoings – including in some cases what they spend on evenings out – and checking that loans can still be afforded if interest rates rise. However the mortgage market review, as it's called, did not set a limit on income multiples, and borrowers have still been able to borrow high income multiples. Lloyds Group was the first to raise the alarm about house prices in London by capping applications for mortgages of more than £500,000 at no more than four times a borrower's salary. RBS followed shortly afterwards. The Financial Policy Committee, was set up by the coalition government in response to the 2008 banking crisis, which in turn exposed a lack of forward thinking by policymakers about the risks to the financial system. It is chaired by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney and charged with monitoring risks to the financial system and taken steps to remove those risks. Until now the FPC has been able demand that banks (via their regulators) hold more capital in general and also specifically against three sectors – residential loans, commercial property lending and financial institutions. It has also been able to make recommendations about the way banks are lending in terms of the value of mortgages compared to borrowers' income or value of their home. It also monitoring the Help to Buy scheme set up to make it easier to get a home loan. When it was first asked about the tools it would like to able to control the markets two years ago, the committee rejected asking for this power because it felt there needed to be more debate about the way it could intervene in the markets. Last year banks in New Zealand were forced to restrict new lending to customers with small deposits, in a move that made it more difficult to get a mortgage with less than a 20% downpayment on a home. Mark Carney has experience from Canada where he ran the central bank until a year ago and steps were taken to cool the housing market by forcing borrowers to pay off their mortgages over a shorter time scale. Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore are examples of other countries which have taken steps to cool their housing market. In Switzerland, the banks have been forced to hold more capital against mortgages. The next quarterly meeting of the FPC takes place next week. It is scheduled to announce what decisions it has taken on 26 June when there were already expectations that it would take steps to take the some of the heat out of the mortgage market. But it is not expected that it will decide to use the new power to limit the size of a mortgage as a share of a borrower's income or the value of the house yet because policy makers do yet think there is a systemic risk from the housing market. After the 2008 banking crisis, the mortgage market came to a halt as confidence dried up, the economy deteriorated and lenders found it difficult to raise the money to pass on to borrowers. A series of measures were introduced to try to get the home loans flowing again. The FPC has already forced the government to modify the funding for lending scheme so that it could no longer support lending for homes and instead be focused on small businesses. The concern of politicians – and policy makers – is to ensure these are not storing up problems, and creating a new set of problems for the financial system."
217	218	Danny Welbeck seeking Manchester United exit despite Van Gaal new era 	Danny Welbeck has expressed his frustrations about the frequency with which he has been played out of position at , rejecting the chance to say he wanted to be part of the Louis van Gaal era and making it clear that he is still contemplating leaving the club despite the arrival of the new manager. Welbeck, speaking for the first time about the uncertainty surrounding his future, said he had started to feel disaffected because of his “frustrating” inability to establish himself in the central role he craves. It had been his “unhappiest season, without a doubt” and the player is concerned it will continue that way when Van Gaal takes charge after the World Cup. “I’d like to play centrally,” he said. “I’ve been playing on the left for a while and it’s got to the time when I want to stake a place up front.” Those chances appear slim, as Welbeck is aware, when the competition is provided by Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney and especially when United’s exploratory talks about Edinson Cavani’s potential availability from Paris St-Germain demonstrate they are open to the idea of bringing in another attacker. Welbeck’s advisers have already let United know he is willing to sever his ties with the club, albeit reluctantly, and Tottenham Hotspur are among his admirers. Asked directly whether he could clarify that he still wanted to leave, he replied: “I’d rather not answer that question.” Welbeck was subsequently asked whether it had reached this point because of his desire to play as a centre-forward. “Yes,” he said, “it does get frustrating. You want to play in a certain position and you’re not getting the opportunity to do that. It’s the same for everyone else when they are being played out of position and they don’t really like it.” The 23-year-old is often criticised for his goal output but made the point that, as a wide player, it was regarded as “a bonus” to score. His issue is particularly when United operate with a 4-4-2 system. “It depends what formation we are playing. On the left of a four-man midfield there are a lot more defensive duties so you can’t find the time to keep attacking. But if you’re on the left of a 4-3-3, I find that position really good. I can play in any formation but, if I play on the left, I’d rather play there if there are three in midfield.” Ideally, though, he wants the chance to show he can score regularly as an orthodox striker. “I played there for United over the Christmas period and scored a few then. I just want opportunities.” Welbeck said he had become particularly unhappy over the last season – “I’d rather not think about it,” he replied, when asked to elaborate – and is known to be one of the players who found it difficult accepting David Moyes’ style of management. At one point Moyes publicly stated that Welbeck should put in extra work on the training ground, a statement that went down badly with the player. “I was pretty surprised, to be honest. I’ve grown up at Manchester United and been professional all through my career and I always do extra work. It’s born and bred in me to do extra work after training. He came out with that statement but, before then, I had been doing extra training. Maybe he just didn’t see it.” To illustrate the point Welbeck took a personal fitness trainer with him to Dubai when the members of Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad had a week off before joining England’s training camp in Portugal. “I wouldn’t say I play better for England but my goals-per-game ratio is definitely better,” he continued. “Formation-wise, I’m much freer up front because, when I play on the left for England, with three in midfield and three up front, there is more defensive cover rather than me being that defensive cover. For United I’m more likely to be left-wing in a four-man midfield, with only two central midfielders, so it’s a bit more difficult for me to make runs and score goals when I’ve got to think about my defensive duties. Maybe I’m let off the leash a bit more for than United.”
223	224	Currency market rigging could become criminal offence 	"Rigging the foreign exchange, bond and commodity markets could become a criminal offence, the government will warn the City on Thursday as part of its latest effort to clean up the financial markets after a wave of scandals and allegations relating to key benchmarks. Criminal offences for manipulating these global markets, which are based in London, will be among measures considered in a year-long review being launched by the chancellor, which was immediately criticised by Labour for being too late. It follows steps in 2012 to allow prison sentences of up to seven years for anyone involved in rigging the key interest rate benchmark Libor. is expected to say in his Mansion House speech: ""The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. ""Markets here set the interest rates for people's mortgages, the exchange rates for our exports and holidays, and the commodity prices for the goods we buy. I am going to deal with abuses, tackle the unacceptable behaviour of the few and ensure that markets are fair for the many who depend on them."" A European directive published in February set out rules for making abuse of such markets a criminal offence, but Osborne intends to opt out of this directive – a move a Treasury source insisted was not intended to delay the implementation of possible prison sentences but to give the UK the ability to bring in new rules more quickly than the EU's 2016 deadline. The chancellor is asking the new deputy governor of the Bank of England, Minouche Shafik, to lead the review of ""fair and effective markets along with Martin Wheatley, the boss of the who led a review into Libor rigging, and Charles Roxburgh, the director general of financial services at the Treasury. But any tougher regime will take time to implement as the review will not be completed until after the general election and a consultation on the review will not begin until the autumn. Cathy Jamieson MP, the shadow financial secretary, said: ""This review is too little, too late. We pressed ministers to regulate commodities markets and the full array of financial benchmarks back in 2012, but the chancellor failed to act."" The Libor-rigging scandal, blown open in June 2012 when Barclays was fined £290m by regulators in the UK and US, prompted scrutiny of other benchmarks used to price financial products and has led to investigations into the £3tn-a-day currency markets as well as an analysis of gold pricing. The chancellor signalled his intention to target foreign exchange markets – already under investigation by regulators in the UK and abroad – at a conference last week, he had to ensure the UK was ""bolstering the integrity of the London markets"". A panel of market users is also being set up to contribute to the new review. The chancellor will be speaking alongside the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, and criticised bankers' adoption of a ""heads I win, tails you lose"" system. The global Financial Stability Board, chaired by Carney, is working on ways to bolster the forex markets, which trade 24 hours a day but rely on a daily ""fix"" at 4pm. The Bank has called in Anthony Grabiner, a leading QC, to look into whether its staff condoned manipulation of the markets. Osborne also intends to consult on extending one of the recommendations of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by the Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie and set up after the Barclays fine, for new regimes governing senior managers and the certification of top bankers. This could be extended to foreign bankers with branches in the UK."
226	227	Apple in court over ebook price-fixing accusations 	" went on trial in New York on Monday over accusations by the US department of justice of conspiring with publishers to raise the price of ebooks in the US. Though the company does not face a fine, the outcome could shape what deals online retailers can make with content owners. The DoJ is seeking a block on Apple engaging in similar conduct in future – and the company is resisting. The five publishers previously cited in the case have already settled with the DoJ. The trial judge has urged Apple to follow suit, after looking at evidence including emails from Steve Jobs to James Murdoch, then head of News Group-owned Harper Collins. Jobs, who died in 2011, told his biographer: ""We told the publishers, 'We'll go to the agency model, where you set the price, and we get our 30% and yes, the customer pays a little more, but that's what you want anyway.'"" Yet chief executive insisted last week that he would not settle. ""We're not going to sign something that says we did something we didn't do,"" he said. ""And so we're going to fight."" The suit, filed in April 2012, accused Apple and the publishers of trying in 2009 to set ebook prices across the industry so that they could break the hold of Amazon, which at the time had around 90% of the market and sometimes sold ebooks at a loss to promote sales of its Kindle. Apple says it acted independently rather than conspiring with publishers. The DoJ says two publishers encouraged Apple to set up an ""agency"" model, where they would set the retail price, from which Apple would keep a set percentage – unlike at Amazon, which bought wholesale and determined its own retail price. District judge Denise Cote, who is hearing the case without a jury, urged the company to settle. She said in a hearing on 23 May: ""I believe that the government will be able to show at trial direct evidence that Apple knowingly participated in and facilitated a conspiracy to raise prices of ebooks."" Apple could still face damages from individual US states and consumers if found guilty. The publishers – Penguin Group, Harper Collins, Simon & Schuster, Hachette and Macmillan – have already agreed to pay a total of $164m (£107m) and not to ban wholesale discounting of their ebooks."
229	230	Welsh assembly members to boycott £10,000 pay rise 	Senior Welsh politicians who are to receive a £10,000 pay rise after next year’s assembly election have said they will not accept the increase. The annual salary of backbenchers will jump by 17% to £64,000, it was confirmed on Friday by the independent body that sets the pay and allowances of assembly members (AMs). Members voiced their unease at next year’s planned salary increase – which comes during a time of continued cuts to public spending and the ongoing squeeze on taxpayers’ budgets. The Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, Kirsty Williams, said: “At a time when public sector workers have seen their pay packets either frozen or rise only slightly, it is wrong to hand out such a huge hike in assembly members’ pay.” She added she would scrap the proposed increase if re-elected. , the Plaid Cymru leader, echoed these sentiments and said: “When many in the public sector and private sector are getting a 1% pay rise, a pay freeze or even a proposed real-terms cut, I cannot support such a large salary increase for assembly members. “I have said before that I would accept the proposed increase when there is a living wage for all of the quarter of a million Welsh workers who are currently earning less than is needed to live on.” Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister and Labour AM said he could not see how his party would support the increase. Under the scheme, his pay will increase to £140,000 while his cabinet members will receive £100,000 each. When the plans were first announced last year, Jones said: “I was as surprised as anyone at the proposals we have seen come forward. I recognise, of course, in these difficult times, how people will feel about this.” The pay increase, first proposed six months ago, is expected to cost taxpayers about £700,000 more next year. However Sandy Blair, chairman of the remuneration board, said the increased pay was necessary to help politicians deal with increased devolution in . He said: “Our duty is to ensure that there is financial support in place that attracts the best people to put their names forward for the role of assembly member. “Where we have found barriers that dissuade people from standing for election, we have tried to address them.” Blair added that while AMs’ basic pay would increase, changes to their pensions would see a reduction in taxpayers’ contributions. The chair of the pay panel said the job of being an assembly member had changed significantly since 2010, when the salary was last reviewed. Friday’s news of the pay hike comes as the the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is consulting on plans to increase the pay of MPs in Westminster by £7,000 – from £67,000 to £74,000.

De Boer added that until the season ends next week, he is concerned only with Ajax, . Then, he will be willing to entertain the possibility of a change, though the 43-year-old coach said he is satisfied at Ajax, his first major coaching job. ""I'm going to listen and talk,"" he said. ""Then I'll make my feelings known. I want to add something to a club, so that people can say that they see the hand of Frank de Boer. Liverpool are a good example of this with Brendan Rodgers."" The current Spurs manager Tim Sherwood had . ""At every press conference at our training centre, it was 'you're keeping the seat warm for someone else'. Yeah, I am but the seat's getting quite hot,"" Sherwood said. ""Every press conference I do it's 'this manager's coming in … [Louis] Van Gaal … then [Glenn] Hoddle, this one and that one.' Some of these managers are actually touting themselves for my job. I don't think that's right. It's something that doesn't sit well with me. ""If anyone ever asks me about another job I just tell them that they've got another manager. Until they haven't got a manager and until I haven't got a job, say nothing."""
246	247	World Cup 2014: what did we learn from Klinsmann's USA squad 	"With Landon Donovan’s omission from the 23-man USA party still reverberating, the other story lines within Jürgen Klinsmann’s squad have, inevitably, been overshadowed. But there's a lot going on in the final 23, and Donovan's exclusion was far from the only surprise in a young squad. So: position by position, how does this squad stack up? (Aston Villa) (Everton) (Real Salt Lake) Nobody The one area where there was little argument. The best three keepers available are going to Brazil, with Howard the starter. Klinsmann has experimented with DC United’s Bill Hamid and the Chicago Fire’s Sean Johnson, to give them experience, but on consistency alone it’s hard to argue with Rimando as the No3 behind two Premier League players. Then again, Klinsmann has made more than one selection for the future … (Puebla) (Sporting Kansas City) (Hertha Berlin) (Stoke City) (Nürnberg) (Los Angeles Galaxy) (Borussia Mönchengladbach) (Seattle Sounders) (Seattle) (San Jose Earthquakes) (Columbus Crew) Before we get into the implications of the defensive selection, let’s take a moment to congratulate DaMarcus Beasley on making a fourth World Cup. Then let’s take a moment to wonder whether Beasley has the speed or legs to operate in a fourth World Cup. He can still get forward and contribute intelligently but anyone who has watched him over the past year or so knows that with that comes a long journey back to defend. Given the USA’s group opponents, it will be a risk every time he crosses the halfway line. Looking at the rest of the defensive lineup, we see the first evidence of the dominance of two of the three US constituencies with which Klinsmann has experimented. Of the Mexican-based players tried out along the backline in the most recent cycle, Jose Torres of Tigres, Edgar Castillo of Tijuana and Michael Orozco of Puebla missed the final 30, and when it came to the final 23, Klinsmann tended to favour German-based Americans over MLS players he had used in qualifying. So Nürnberg’s Timothy Chandler, absent for most of the last year, makes the squad, as does Hertha Berlin’s John Brooks. Borussia Monchengladbach’s Fabian Johnson looks like he’s got a full-back nod, while Brad Evans, who played extensively at right-back in qualifying, missed out. Evans was in sanguine mood afterwards: You got off easy this time In one of the surprises of the squad, Evans’ team mate DeAndre Yedlin, a speedy, homegrown Seattle player, did make the 23. Like Beasley, he offer an attacking threat on the overlap, but is still very raw defensively and can be caught upfield. He is an undoubted prospect though, in a squad weighted with them. One of the most intriguing partnerships of the last year is still potentially intact going into the World Cup, as Omar Gonzalez and Matt Besler are in the frame to complete what at one time would have seemed an unthinkable all-MLS central defensive partnership. Clarence Goodson’s European experience was not enough to dislodge them, or indeed Brooks, and he leaves the 30 to head back to San Jose. The final piece of the jigsaw, one that has knock-on effects in midfield, is the inclusion of Geoff Cameron, whose ability to play right-back (as he does at Stoke), central defender and defensive midfield gets him the nod as a vital utility man. It meant that Evans’ limited versatility could be discounted, as could Michael Parkhurst’s ability across the backline, and indeed Maurice Edu’s ability to move between defence and midfield. Other than Beasley, this is a very inexperienced defence at international level. It does have the potential to counter at pace. Whether it has the intelligence to know when to do so will be one of the tests. (RSL) (Nantes) (Toronto FC) (Houston Dynamo) (Rosenborg) (Bayern Munich) (Besiktas) (Sporting KC) (Galaxy), (Tijuana), (Philadelphia Union) Let’s assume . How does the remaining roster look? Well first of all there’s no room for Joe Corona, who’d done enough to edge the likes of Sacha Kljestan and Benny Feilhaber but hadn’t quite shown enough to buck the trend of Mexican-based players missing out. Edu might have hoped his ability to fill in at the back would have got him one of the defensive midfield spots, but he misses out for Kyle Beckerman, who is an intriguing inclusion. In the recent game against Mexico, Beckerman played at the base of a midfield diamond, as he does for RSL, and allowed Michael Bradley to get forward. Beckerman doesn’t have great foot speed, but he’s a player who makes intelligent and responsible decisions and as a potential counterpoint to the risks that come from springing into attack, he’s an intriguing option. He’s also a necessary option, given that the first choice midfield partner for Bradley, Jermaine Jones, is prone to yellow cards. So to perhaps the most controversial inclusion in the squad – 18-year-old Julian Green. As is widely known and discussed, Green currently plays with Bayern Munich’s German fourth-division affiliate, and was recently persuaded by Klinsmann to commit to the rather than Germany, with some suggesting that a World Cup place may have been dangled as part of a quid pro quo deal. Being on the books of one of the biggest club sides in the world, Green undoubtedly has rare promise among potential USA players, but given the few minutes he has played for USA the question of whether he will be trusted in a crisis evokes memories of Sven-Goran Ericksson’s inclusion of the unused Theo Walcott in the 2006 England squad – and a USA squad arguably has less room for anyone who might conceivably be a passenger. The presence of Mix Diskerud is equally intriguing. Diskerud has shown in flashes that he’s not intimidated by big games and is willing to try something. In a best-case scenario, he could be the unheralded player who makes a decisive intervention in the group stages. At least as much as the central-defensive pairing of Besler and Gonzalez, the inclusion of Brad Davis and Graham Zusi represents something of an endorsement for MLS. When Zusi broke into the national set-up last year, he was seen to be getting his chance through the absence of Donovan on his sabbatical. Davis has a sweet left foot and is very dangerous from set-pieces. He has also been in form this year, and is an honest and industrious player. Is that enough for him to have supplanted Donovan? It’s a pressure he could have done without. For pressure, read Michael Bradley. Simply put, Bradley is the lynchpin of this team. If he doesn’t play, neither do they. Clint Dempsey may have the ability to put the team on his shoulders, but without Bradley, they’ll fall straight off. Finally, Alejandro Bedoya of Nantes – a name that should probably figure in the Donovan conversation at least as much as Davis. Like Davis he offers a wide attacking option, a decent work ethic and as yet not a lot else that suggests that he will be the man to make the difference in a tight game, as Donovan can. Perhaps it’s his cheerleading skills: (Sunderland) (Seattle) (AZ Alkmaar) (San Jose) (Rapid Vienna) Again, this is an intriguing line-up. Every player on this list comes into the tournament with questions hanging over them – none more so than Jozy Altidore after his annus horribilis with Sunderland. Even from an optimistic point of view, looking at how hard he worked as an isolated front man, and the occasional piece of smart link-up play he provided, Altidore’s return as a Premier League striker was very poor. His club coach, Gus Poyet, has indicated he’ll stick with him, but Altidore played himself as close to the exit as he could this year. It’s not to say Altidore couldn’t hit the patch of confidence and form that saw him go on an international goalscoring spree this time last year, but the last year seems to have taken its toll on his ability to hit anything. A lot will depend on how Dempsey and possibly Bradley, supporting the attack, are able to supply to him, and his ability to get off to a fast start against Ghana (or, ideally, in the remaining warm-up games). Clint Dempsey has been in imperious form for Seattle since returning from an indifferent loan spell at Fulham. There’d been a suggestion the US captain had plateaued before he signed for Seattle from Tottenham, and it seemed born out by a fatigued ending to the year and that Fulham loan. But given two consecutive seasons without a proper pre-season, owing to his transfers, and that being compounded by the staggered MLS calendar, Dempsey’s problem has been of getting the rhythms of his match fitness right. He’s a key player anyway, and the fact that he has rounded into form at just the right time is huge for the USA. Aron Johansson and Chris Wondolowski round out the striking options, with Terrence Boyd missing out – and Donovan, depending on how you look at it. Johansson’s goalscoring form in Holland sees him get the nod (it should be noted Altidore was piling home goals in Holland last season), while Wondolowski, poacher that he is, seems to have timed his run into the squad perfectly, with his goals in recent friendlies against South Korea and Mexico rubber-stamping his entry into the 23. Those goals were important. After a frustrating start in various cameos for the national team, Wondolowski scored five in the Gold Cup last year, but these were against weaker opposition – the more recent goals answered some questions about how he could perform against better defenses. Certainly Wondolowski’s movement and uncanny ability to find space in the six-yard box makes him a useful option to throw on late in games against tired defences. As the odd man out Terrence Boyd may count himself unlucky, after a strong season for Rapid Vienna ended in a run of goals. It seems those goals were enough to make the 30, but not enough to get the final call, with Wondolowski’s arc and style just eclipsing his. At least Boyd can console himself that he got closer than one-time wonder kid Juan Agudelo, who at 21 has found his way to Europe, but not to Brazil. Asked about the relative inexperience of the squad in his Friday press conference, especially at World Cup level, Klinsmann insisted World Cup players have ""got to start somewhere"", before insisting that the likes of Brooks, Yedlin and Green were more than capable of ""surprising a few people"". Beyond Donovan of course, the surprise is not so much Klinsmann's well established predilection for throwing youth into testing situations, but the critical mass of inexperience he has gone with. Even the older players have little World Cup experience between them. There is an argument that this was the type of brave but painful selection that had to be made at some point in the USA's development if there was to be a true generational flowering, beyond the traditional search for a functional 30-man pool in any given tournament June. Despite his claims to the contrary on Friday it's doubtless an argument that Klinsmann, with his mandate until 2018 and his unprecedented power in US Soccer, would conceivably make himself. He may even see it as a duty, given his contract extension, to realistically assess US prospects in this tournament and weigh them against the broader need for the technical side of US soccer to develop. As the white heat around Donovan's omission has shown, the immediate consequences of that decision will dog Klinsmann until – if – something goes right in the next seven weeks. This is not a generation of talented German starlets being given a chance on home soil. This is a USA soccer environment where true depth and development has hitherto been an unaffordable luxury. We may be about to find out if it still is."
261	262	Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand reveals how secret videos inspired players 	"Roberto Di Matteo had suggested he had something unexpected planned to motivate his players in the buildup to the final. Yet, as they gathered in a private room at the Mandarin Oriental hotel on the eve of the showpiece for what they anticipated would be a routine tactical team-talk, none of Chelsea's players had quite envisaged the lengths to which their interim first-team coach had gone in his preparation. Where the squad had anticipated ProZone graphics flitting across the big screen clamped to the far wall, instead the messages delivered were of a far more personal nature. Two weeks previously, Di Matteo had commissioned the club's video analysis team to compile video messages from members of each player's family, their words of encouragement inter-cut with YouTube clips from games and even footage of them growing up as children, which were duly delivered in Big Brother style in front of an increasingly emotional audience. The presentation lasted around half an hour, the playing staff veering from fits of laughter to the brink of tears. ""They really surprised us with those messages,"" said Didier Drogba. ""The families have always been there with us – in Moscow in 2008, against Barcelona in 2009, when we lost those games. This win I want to dedicate to them, all our families, because they have been supporting us, always believing in us. This is their victory."" For Ryan Bertrand, the rookie in the starting lineup, the moment was particularly poignant. The full-back had never previously featured in European competition, having failed to gain inclusion in the squad for the group stage or even on the bench in the knockout ties. Yet, with injury and suspension limiting Di Matteo's options, the 22-year-old debuted in an unfamiliar midfield berth on Saturday and, having been a steady presence for 73 minutes, departed Munich still pinching himself with a winner's medal draped around his neck. His own video message had served to inspire. ""We just got called into the meeting and there they were, for every single player,"" he said. ""First it was my mum and brother saying: 'Well done and good luck to the whole team,' and then it went to all the rabble, all the family, which was a little bit embarrassing. There could have been some tears but there was a bit of laughter and banter too, and the whole thing really spurred us on. That was a brilliant touch."" Bertrand had trained all week in midfield but, with Florent Malouda's hamstring injury on the mend, only discovered on Saturday morning that he would start the final. ""I did my best to put the fact that it was the Champions League final to the back of my mind and take it as another game,"" he said. ""I say that but pre-match, trying to prepare for the game, I had all these images flashing through my head: of where I have been and where I have come from. ""I thought about my brother, growing up in the Friary Estate in Peckham and around Bermondsey. I remember playing 'World Cup', like a tournament with every man for himself, at the bottom of these flats. There was spray paint on the wall and a sign saying 'No ball games'. That meant 'let's play football there'. I just wanted to go out there and do myself justice. "" His was a steady performance in direct confrontation with Arjen Robben and Philipp Lahm, the Germany captain, with the support offering him a standing ovation as he departed with 17 minutes of normal time remaining and the contest still goalless. This was reward for an apprenticeship served largely on loan at a collection of Football League clubs, with the defender, who had been signed controversially from Gillingham as a 15‑year‑old, now intent upon proving he belongs in this company. ""If you go out on loan, you have to think about yourself and your career and be realistic. There have been times when I've wondered about whether I'd make it but in life you have to have Plan A, B and C. So we looked at it realistically with my mum and my family and, thankfully, I have dug in there and managed to turn a few people's heads. ""This time last year I had just come back from Nottingham Forest and was trying to see how many games I could get before the end of the season. In the meantime, I was playing reserves and chipping in to keep my fitness. We won the Reserve League that year, so all this feels like a bit of a contrast."""
272	273	Bayern Munich party like it's 1999 after 'incomprehensible' defeat 	"ayern Munich went straight from the stadium to their end-of-season dinner at the Postpalast event hall but could not escape the Blues: the sombre, slow music blasting from the loudspeakers, coupled with the disastrous result in the European Cup final, turned the midnight banquet into a wake. The executive chairman, Karl‑Heinz Rummenigge, who conducted the post-mortem in front of hundreds of sponsors and VIPs, at first struggled to determine the cause of death of Bayern's dream. The raw pain of defeat made a rational analysis difficult. ""It's one of those evenings where you feel as if you'd better stayed at home; 1999 [against Manchester United] was incredibly brutal, but tonight is more sad, even more brutal and also more unnecessary,"" he said. ""You wonder how this result has come to pass. It's incomprehensible really. It's like Franz Beckenbauer just said on television: 'The English had little to do [with this game].' I think that when they wake up tomorrow with the cup they will ask themselves: 'What actually happened for us to win the cup and not , who were better, who did more for the game, who created unbelievable chances?' I feel sorry for this team because they've played a great Champions League season."" ""That's football, we've seen it in the past, the deserved winner doesn't always have the cup in their hands,"" said the distraught Thomas Müller, one of the few players who felt able to face the media at the final whistle. But Bayern, the club for whom second best is never acceptable, also faced up to their own shortcomings. ""When you see the game, you can't expect to win it,"" said the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. ""But we had three [match-winning] chances and we didn't take any of them. So we only have ourselves to blame."" That sentiment was echoed by the president, Uli Hoeness, who cut a desolate figure. The 1974 World Cup winner was close to tears in the stands and had to be consoled by his wife, Susi. ""We were in control throughout, I was only worried when it was 1‑1 and with three minutes of injury time,"" he said. ""You simply have to finish them off when you have this many opportunities."" Bayern had taken the lead through Thomas Müller in the 83rd minute – ""at the perfect time"", said Hoeness – but could not see out the game. Arjen Robben then missed a penalty in extra time before they squandered a 3‑1 lead in the penalties. For Bayern, who have built their reputation in Germany on scoring late goals and having a big-game mentality, this was failure on an unimaginable scale – on home soil, of all places. ""It's madness, really cruel,"" said Hoeness. The sporting director, Christian Nerlinger, called it ""a total nightmare, like a really bad film"". The Bavarians felt so bad that they went as far as comparing their fate with that of Bayer Leverkusen, runners-up in three competitions 10 years ago. ""We always laughed a little at them; now we're in the same situation,"" Hoeness said. ""In the long run, I don't feel like coming second all the time. It's not a situation I can accept."" As ever with Bayern, a season without trophies will have major repercussions. The manager Jupp Heynckes, a friend of Hoeness, will be safe until his contract runs its course next summer but Hoeness voiced doubts about his players' mental strength. ""We have to ask ourselves why this happened,"" he said. ""Do we have the players who really force the issue? Do we have enough of them? I don't want to criticise the team but I saw a few things I didn't like. I'm not sure how they will respond, I don't want to make any negative or positive predictions. But I didn't see a Jens Jeremies today, a guy who bites opponents in the calf on the way on to the pitch."" Jeremies, a former Germany midfielder, was a member of the Bayern side who won the 2001 Champions League final. Bayern can be expected to console themselves with a heavy dose of shopping this summer, even if Hoeness would not be drawn on the level of investment. ""We will have to sit down with the board and then make very calm decisions,"" he said. ""We don't want to put too much pressure on ourselves. It hasn't been a catastrophic season."" For the city of Munich, the anticlimax could not have been more soul-destroying after a day of sunshine and unbridled euphoria. Hundreds of thousands of Bayern supporters who had congregated at the many public viewing areas gasped in shock as Didier Drogba converted the decisive penalty, then struggled to get home as the subway broke down. Outside the Allianz Arena, dignitaries were scrapping for taxis. The delirious Chelsea fans who had successfully gatecrashed the Bavarian party were dancing and singing by themselves in the city centre; just as in 1999, the stunned Bayern supporters could only congratulate and leave in a funk of disbelief. One Chelsea fan had to be rescued by fire fighters after climbing a statue at Feldherrnhalle. ""Munich even had to help the Brits with celebrating,"" wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung. The media's bullishness in advance of the match was eerily out of sync with the mood in the city in the small hours of Sunday morning. ""For you the beer, for us the cup, with kind regards!"" local tabloid Abendzeitung had told the visiting supporters on the day of the final. In the end, the English had both."
275	276	Ways to right the coalition wrongs of NHS reorganisation 	The (8 April) clearly identifies the problems the NHS has experienced in recent years. Key to the future is the issue of funding. The NHS accounted for less than 4% of GDP in its early years and this has risen to more than 9% now, with a particularly steep increase under Labour from 1997. Such increases have led to concerns regarding the system’s sustainability. But this reflects a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the healthcare system. Decades ago the American economist defined certain sectors as being “handicraft industries” (health, education, the performing arts) that were disproportionately reliant on people rather than machinery, and as such with limited productivity gains. Elsewhere, productivity gains are more easily attained and goods become cheaper (such as the laptop I am using to write this). Technological developments in healthcare have been immense and we should always try to do things efficiently, but as any economy develops we should expect to spend proportionately more on the healthcare system. The good thing is that this is affordable because other “goods” are getting relatively cheaper. What is required is the political will to maintain and increase healthcare funding and less emphasis on trying to produce a system built on commercial values. Far from cutting down on bureaucracy the now has a bewildering number of new bodies Many hundreds more doctors could have signed the letter you published. The Tory/Lib Dem coalition wasted eye-watering amounts of money on an ill-thought-out and even less well understood reorganisation that set back the NHS many years. Far from cutting down on bureaucracy, the NHS now has a bewildering number of new bodies, with not enough clarity about who does what. There is little strategic planning and systems have become fragmented. What has this to do with patients, you might ask? One example: over three days last week we tried to find a scarce bed for a mentally ill and highly distressed 17-year-old languishing for far too many hours in an A&E department. There are too few beds for such unwell young people and where once we had some sort of system to facilitate an admission locally to those beds that did exist, now there is none. It is unconscionable. The letter about the state of the NHS is unsurprising as many doctors, alongside a wide range of organisations and individuals covering consumer and professional interests, had fought long and hard against the passage of the . At that time, as is normal, a “risk register” was drawn up by officials as part of the process of good governance. However, good practice does not stretch so far as openness. Jeremy Hunt, and his predecessor – the architect of the act – have both defiantly ignored a lawful instruction from the information commissioner and then a statutory information tribunal to publish that register. Perhaps they are aware that in publishing they may be damned – and that we will learn that officials had warned them of all these issues? Time to open the books. There is much disingenuousness, even hypocrisy, in the letter from the 140 NHS professionals. Almost all NHS purchases depend on private companies for supply – be it medicines, x-ray machines or computers. Most are essentially private contractors to the health service. Have the correspondents considered how their very adequate salaries are paid? The answer is from taxes made by profits. One might also ask how many promises on the NHS were broken by Tony Blair and his government? Certainly I was deceived by them. Thank you for printing the (7 April). Many of your readers will have examples of policies that could help reduce the misuse of the services the NHS so ably provide. My contribution involves the training of the thousands of staff with clinical expertise. Why is it that billions is spent on training staff to work in the NHS only for the private sector to then employ such staff with no contribution to their training? Surely there should be a contribution to this training; a tax contribution? Costed properly this could bring in funding that could be earmarked specifically for the training of the additional staff the political parties promise us. As a registered nurse of several decades’ standing, I ask for a simple act of honesty from any new government. Bus companies providing patient transport services; treatment centres that work for profit; social enterprise partnerships; community interest cooperatives and the rest should not be allowed to plaster the NHS logo all over their literature, buildings and vehicles. Our car does not have a particular supermarket logo on it just because it is our preferred provider. If a patient has a problem with one of these bodies and brings it to me, I feel unprofessional when explaining they are nothing to do with us, and I have to give them the relevant complaints number or email address. Their anger, directed at me on the frontline, is understandable. Martha Lane Fox is right ( , 31 March). We need a new kind of digital organisation – doteveryone – which would fight for civic public projects to balance the power of the commercial internet. An area where this could pay immediate dividends is in health. The , which I chaired, recommended just such an organisation in its report last October to support digital health innovations that have the potential to revolutionise healthcare. New York has such an organisation – the New York ehealth Collaborative – which works closely with 23 hospitals across the state to create cutting-edge products to improve care, increase patient involvement and provide access to personal health information. Is it possible the BBC is adopting a less-than-balanced approach to news reporting in the runup to May’s election? The amount of health data now available is opening up new possibilities to shift care from “diagnose and treat” to “predict and prevent”. Better data will mean more personalised medicine as well as better ways of understanding the effectiveness of treatments. But in London too many digital entrepreneurs find it too hard to access capital, obtain clinical input and get products adopted by the NHS. So they end up launching overseas. What would be good for patients would be good for London. London could lead the world in this field with its strong creative and tech industries. Just as the National Institute for Care and Health Excellence was the global pioneer for assessing new drugs and treatments in the last decade, London should become the pioneer for digital health technology assessments in the decade ahead. On 1 April the Telegraph published a letter signed by 103 business men and women, many of whom are Tory supporters and donors, stating that “Labour would threaten jobs and deter investment” ( , 1 April, guardian.com). This letter was widely reported and analysed on BBC radio and TV. On 8 April the Guardian published a letter signed by more than 100 doctors. I have heard no mention of the letter on either BBC radio or TV news bulletins. Is it possible that the BBC is adopting a less-than-balanced editorial approach to news reporting in the runup to May’s general election? I find this deeply worrying. The letter from NHS doctors surely fails the NHS in exactly the way that all political parties are failing it. The cost of healthcare is rising and will continue to rise as our population ages. Politicians may or may not be able to find a few billions to get us through the next few years but further ahead there is a stark choice. Either there must be a really large increase in taxation for healthcare or the system must be altered. The coalition has gone for the second and its failure to get many things (anything?) right does not alter the underlying argument. I would suggest three topics that should be brought into public debate. First, payment for some services. Payments could be low and might cost more to collect than the yield but it would help limit demand (the poorest should not pay). Second, a huge amount of money is spent on screening. This may save some lives but the main effect is to turn well people into patients while consuming medical resources. Finally, an enormous proportion of the budget is spent in the last few weeks of life. Surely we need to be a bit tougher about heroic measures for the dying. This would put a great burden on doctors but it is not clear that they have the balance right now. I am only suggesting an informed debate on these difficult subjects. Burying our heads in the sand will only work for so long. Many years ago I took round our general practice a visiting party of American family physicians. Discussing the large proportion of our work that was dealing with minor illness, they nodded their heads and said that although they all charged their patients for every consultation they found that a large proportion of their work was dealing with minor illness. Charges at the door would do nothing to keep down attendance rates and everything to destroy what surely even politicians can see is the finest of Bevan’s founding principles. It is clear there must be a stop to the return of a Conservative-led government, but how is this to be achieved? You can find out what your candidates think about the draft NHS reinstatement bill by visiting and following the links. This bill does not give a blueprint for the future but rather erases the mistakes of the past while minimising further reorganisation of the NHS. The Greens and the National Health Action party support it. If only we had a transferrable vote we could all express our feelings about it at the ballot box. Five years ago, I believed the Conservatives’ pledges on the NHS. It is not a mistake I will repeat Why is no one demanding of the Tories publication of the report on the NHS presented to government in December 2014 ( , 7 March)? It is said to be very critical of Andrew Lansley’s reforms and would be a major election issue. If the government will not release it why is there not a huge demand for transparency? The Tories are hiding this until after the election. What right have they to do this? Jeremy Hunt says he will “spend on the NHS whatever it needs”. As Polly Toynbee and David Walker’s book Cameron’s Coup reminds us, David Cameron stated just prior to the last election that “the last thing the health service needs is a major reorganisation”. Post-election, when we were in just such a reorganisation, Michael Portillo said, “They [the Conservatives] did not believe they could win if they told you what they were going to do.” Jeremy Hunt works hard to exude a well-meaning and concerned persona but this is the man who co-wrote a book that said: “Our ambition [is] in effect denationalising healthcare in Britain” and the NHS was “a 60-year old mistake”… “A fundamentally broken machine”. Five years ago, I believed the Conservatives’ pledges on the NHS. It is not a mistake I will repeat. Zara Aziz ( , Society, 8 April) is misleading on restrictions for exceptional funding, now called individual funding requests. IFRs are considered on a case-by-case basis by a multidisciplinary panel. In south-east London IFR decisions are based on well-developed ethical-legal principles and the process conforms to governance rules. For instance, a patient’s varicose veins exhibiting pain or bleeding above certain severities will be treated. A ganglion cyst will most likely be treated if pain severity criteria are met, but recurrence rate can be high. Some 60 years ago I came to London as a qualified radiographer. I wanted to work as a locum ( , 2 April). I was horrified to learn that agencies would charge both me and the NHS for their services. I could not understand why each hospital did not have its own employment office. I still cannot understand this. I decided to contact each hospital myself and this resulted in all the work I wanted. At the same time I saved myself and the NHS some money.
278	279	Southampton 2-0 Everton 	"Roberto Martínez may have used up all his miracles when he led Wigan Athletic to the FA Cup last season and, if that is the case, then Everton's Champions League dream is surely over. Making predictions is always a dangerous business and Martínez's sides have been renowned for their powers of escapism in the past but a victory for Arsenal against Newcastle on Monday would move them four points clear of with two matches left and the battle for fourth place would be all but over. This was a traumatic defeat for Everton, one that began with Antolín Alcaraz scoring a spectacular own goal inside the first minute and ended with a wonderfully vibrant playing keep-ball as the minutes ticked away. For Everton, dishevelled and despondent by the end, what was most galling was that they had almost beaten themselves. ""We are going to give everything we can,"" Martínez promised. Yet Everton knew that there could be no more slips. last week, a defeat that suggested that Everton do not quite possess the cold-blooded conviction required to take the next step in their evolution, left them with no room for error, even though that is often when Wigan were in their element under Martínez. The feeling before kick-off was that the game would be defined by whether Everton could cope without the injured Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin and on this evidence, their return cannot come soon enough. Suffice to say, it was a difficult afternoon for their replacements, Alcaraz and John Stones. Alcaraz looked every inch a player who had not started since January, so rusty you feared he might eventually grind to a complete, creaking halt, while Stones was a bag of nerves throughout. Everton will also assess Leighton Baines after he limped off near the end, feeling his knee and his calf, although Martínez said it was not a serious injury. ""It's a matter of days,"" he said. While Southampton played well, Everton's inept defending was the story and given what was at stake, this was not a time for farce. But farce was what we got and it took less than a minute for Southampton to expose Everton. Rickie Lambert was found in space on the left and, when he aimed for Sam Gallagher in the middle, Alcaraz took matters into his own hands, flying through the air and bulleting a diving header past a stunned Tim Howard, a Keith Houchen of a header that will stand the test of time. In its own way, it was a brilliant goal. Roy Hodgson, a fixture at St Mary's these days, will have delighted in Adam Lallana's turn away from James McCarthy to initiate the move, while the way Gerard Deulofeu was kept quiet by Southampton's right-back, Nathaniel Clyne, may have also caught the England manager's eye. Stones is another player whose performances have impressed Hodgson recently but the jittery young Everton defender picked the wrong time to have a stinker. He could have given away a penalty after handling a Lallana cross and when he appeared to get a faint glance to Clyne's cross after 31 minutes, Seamus Coleman stooped to head past a thoroughly fed-up Howard. ""Our arrogant way of playing got affected,"" Martínez admitted. Everton, whose extensive injury list meant that they named a 16-year-old, Ryan Ledson, on the bench, were not much better in attack, where the underwhelming Romelu Lukaku wasted three presentable opportunities. Southampton will justifiably say they also had injury problems to overcome but they have now amassed their highest ever points total in the . Their energy rattled Everton, who felt that Leon Osman, replacing Ross Barkley at half-time, should have had a penalty when he tumbled over Dejan Lovren's outstretched leg. McCarthy also had a strong claim ignored and Osman was booked for diving instead, a decision Martínez called ""cheap"". But not quite as cheap as Everton's defending."
283	284	Lloyd Blankfein. King of Wall Street defiant under siege 	" postal worker's son raised on a tough estate in a down-at-heel neighbourhood of Brooklyn, the boss of Goldman Sachs has traded his way from a scrappy job as a gold dealer to the top of Wall Street's most powerful bank. But suddenly, in the eyes of , the US government is trying to destroy him. In a series of angry, defiant phone calls last week, Blankfein told top clients that a $1bn fraud case brought against Goldman by the Securities and Exchange Commission was politically motivated and would ultimately ""hurt America"". A generally humorous man with a self-deprecating wit, Blankfein's usual bonhomie has been shelved. A dimunitive, bald figure who often seems swamped by his grey pinstripe suits, Blankfein, 55, has seen his bank become a lightning rod for outrage over reckless behaviour on Wall Street. The SEC's prosecution, which alleges that Goldman fiddled customers by selling them mortgage derivatives doomed to fail, strikes at the very core of the 141-year-old firm's cherished reputation for financial integrity. The case has helped the Obama administration get the upper hand in a fight with Republicans in Congress for tougher Wall Street regulation. In a speech attended by Blankfein and other top financiers at New York's Cooper Union college last week, Barack Obama harangued bankers, telling them: After politely applauding the president, Blankfein hurried out without a word, surrounded by a supportive posse of senior lieutenants and attendants. Approached by the , he steadfastly refused to acknowledge questions, declining even to offer a ""no comment"". That's unusual for a man who prides himself on his repartee and his dry wit that has, at times, made Goldman's difficulties worse. ""I know I could slit my wrists and people would cheer,"" Blankfein quipped to one interviewer last year. That came hot on the heels of an ill-judged joke to another interviewer, intended, his spin doctors insist, to be self-aware irony, that the bank was doing ""God's work"". A scholarship boy who made it to Harvard, Blankfein's first Wall Street job was for a gold dealer, J Aron & Co, in 1981. The same year, J Aron was bought by Goldman, kicking off Blankfein's rise, initially trading commodities, then fixed-income debt products and, by 2002, as head of Goldman's entire trading floor. He got the top job at Goldman four years ago when the Bush administration tapped up the bank's previous chief executive, Henry Paulson, to become treasury secretary. His appointment surprised many at Goldman, who viewed him as a less polished figure than his predecessors at a bank noted for its elaborately courteous loyalty to corporate clients. Insiders say his background in trading is telling; once best known for its financial advisory and deal-making activities, Goldman's trading operation has become paramount under Blankfein's watch. ""He's really smart, he works very hard and he's got a very irreverent sense of humour,"" says Charles Ellis, author of , a recent book on . ""He's the kind of guy who'll say to you with sincerity, 'I look better on the telephone.' And he's right – he's not a handsome man."" For the first two years of Blankfein's tenure, everything went swimmingly for Goldman. After the bank racked up vast profits of $11.6bn in 2007, Blankfein was awarded a bonus of $68m, making him the highest-paid chief executive on Wall Street and exposing him, seemingly unprepared, to unprecedented scrutiny. Shortly afterwards, the financial crisis began in earnest and Goldman's sure-footedness began to seem malevolently opportunistic. The bank took huge hedging positions, betting that the US property market would plummet and, as millions of Americans faced foreclosure, it ratcheted up profits. When competitors, such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, foundered, Goldman took advantage of cheap credit available from the US Treasury. Admirers say Blankfein's coal-face experience gives him an edge, allowing him a ready grasp of his bank's risk positioning. A former Goldman partner said: ""He's a soldier's soldier. He's been a trader himself and a manager of traders. He somehow knows how to do it."" When asked about his motivation, Blankfein likes to talk of his father, a sorter for the US postal service. On his retirement, Seymour Blankfein's role was filled by a machine. Blankfein junior is said to have been haunted by the spectre of his father working for years at a job that was, in reality, redundant. He is an unlikely character to play the role of Wall Street demon. For all his personal wealth, Blankfein is far from flash and is more likely to spend his evenings reading history books than waving around a platinum credit card in an upmarket cocktail bar. He has been married since 1983 to a former corporate lawyer, Laura, and the couple have three children. . One of Goldman's clever ploys to protect its wealth was to take out billions of dollars of swap positions with insurer AIG, guarding itself against default on complex derivatives. When the credit crunch hit, Goldman made vast collateral calls against AIG and was blamed as a key player in the collapse of the insurance empire, which has required $180bn of aid from taxpayers. The Treasury's decision to meet AIG's commitments played into criticism of Goldman's undue influence; in the space of a single week at the height of the crisis, phone records showed that Blankfein spoke to the US treasury secretary 24 times. Blankfein, who lives in a $26m apartment on the edge of Central Park and has a weekend estate in the Hamptons, has struggled to comprehend the public backlash against his firm's prosperity. To senior Goldman executives, the bank has merely been a canny investor on the financial markets, contributing to ""liquidity"" with its esoteric derivatives and helping business clients across America to raise funds for investment. Within the sanctuary of Goldman's brand-new $2.4bn, 43-storey headquarters on West Street in lower Manhattan, public discontent initially mattered little. The writer captured the popular mood in July when he characterised Goldman as a vampire squid ""relentlessly jabbing its blood funnel into anything that smells like money"". Goldman's flippant response was to point out that vampire squids are harmless to humans. Finally stirred by the extent of public opprobrium, Blankfein offered a vague apology in November, telling a financial conference that his firm ""participated in things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret"". But he has declined to explain exactly what he is sorry for and, in hearings in Washington probing the financial crisis, he has been bombastic in his defence. The SEC's lawsuit against Goldman, is a stark shift in gear. No longer simply the subject of a whispering campaign, Goldman is facing the most damaging allegation that can be levelled against a bank – that it tricked its own clients. Regulators have accused Goldman of encouraging investors to punt on a shaky package of home loans named Abacus without mentioning that the contents were hand-picked by a hedge fund, Paulson & Co, which had a ""short"" position betting on default. Within nine months, 99% of the loans in the Abacus deal had been downgraded, leaving Royal Bank of Scotland with an $840m liability. Richard Bove, an influential US banking analyst, has forecast Blankfein's departure, suggesting that ""someone must fall on their sword for the devastating decline in this company's persona"". Even the , usually sympathetic to business, has twisted the knife, summing up that Goldman is ""greedy until proven guilty"". Blankfein seems determined to fight, adamant that the firm is a victim of envy. He will testify before Congress on Tuesday to argue Goldman's case. He can count on certain allies – the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, stood up for the bank last week. And Blankfein has, in the past, shown a capacity for putting things in proportion. When a colleague began flagging during a series of marathon meetings in the wake of the demise of Lehman Brothers, the Goldman boss reportedly offered limited sympathy. ""You're getting out of a Mercedes to go to the New York Federal Reserve,"" said Blankfein. ""You're not getting out of a Higgins boat on Omaha beach."""
285	286	Gareth Bale goal: I don't think I've seen anything like it, says Xabi Alonso 	"Carlo Ancelotti hailed Gareth Bale after the Welshman's late goal sank Barcelona and for the 19th time in their history. The Welshman galloped towards goal with five minutes remaining and had to swerve off the pitch to beat the defender Marc Bartra before sliding the ball through the legs of the goalkeeper José Manuel Pinto to secure a 2-1 win. The goal came after Bartra had pulled Barcelona back into the game with a powerful header, which cancelled out Ángel di María's first-half opener. It was Bale's first match-winning goal since joining Madrid from Tottenham Hotspur last summer for a world-record fee. ""It was his most important goal, it was the most defining moment of the game,"" the manager Ancelotti said in the post-match press conference. Xabi Alonso added: ""The goal was incredible, I don't think I've seen anything like it. It looked like the ball was going out and he was under pressure, he ran off the pitch to keep it in, it was just amazing. ""Now we have the taste of victory. It was a really exciting game, with both sides playing at their best."" The win earned Ancelotti his first trophy since succeeding José Mourinho as the Madrid manager last summer, and kept the team's hopes of securing a treble alive. Ancelotti added: ""I think we played very well, we were playing against a very strong team. We had to suffer at times but I think it is a deserved victory. We are very proud to have won this competition."" ""More than anything I want to congratulate the players. The atmosphere inside the stadium from both sets of supporters was fantastic, I am happy to be here and to have experienced this spectacle."" Next up for Madrid is their Champions League semi-final tie with the holders, Bayern Munich,while they trail the Primera División leaders, Atlético Madrid, by three points with five games of the campaign to go. Barcelona, meanwhile, look set for their first season without a trophy since 2008, knocked out of the Champions League by Atlético and four points adrift of Diego Simeone's side in the table. However, Ancelotti refused to write off the Catalans. ""You cannot say Barcelona are finished, not everything has gone well for them this season but I think they will remain hopeful of achieving something until the end of the season,"" he said. ""We can say from experience this season that playing against Barcelona is very, very difficult. At times you need a bit of luck to win. In my opinion Barça are not a team at the end of an era. They are still very dangerous."" Gerardo Martino could not hide his disappointment at his side's third straight defeat. The Barcelona manager said: ""Obviously this is not a happy time for us. It has been a very hard week for us but there is nothing else we can do but look ahead to what is left of the league season. It is a very hard blow to take, the expectation on us today was huge and it was a final so everyone was desperate to win."" However, the beleaguered coach vowed to keep going until the end of the campaign. ""I am hurting due to the defeat and for the people that came here with great expectations to support us, but we still have a lot left in the tank,"" he said. ""There is no recipe for recovery. The league doesn't look favourable for us but we are obliged to fight on until the last day."""
286	287	Bank of England denies its rules forced Nationwide into business lending delay 	"The Bank of England has denied that its insistence on holding a bigger capital cushion had forced the UK's largest building society to slow its launch of small business lending. Nationwide admitted plans to expand lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are unlikely to take effect until 2014 at the earliest. It said plans to begin lending to smaller firms were still under development but ""moving slowly""; , it denied a report that it had shelved a planned launch date for later this year. A spokesman for Nationwide said: ""We are building our expertise in this area and hiring people experienced in working with SMEs. These things are happening, albeit they are moving slowly."" The Bank of England rejected any suggestion that Nationwide's decision to hold off from a launch into the SME sector was due to its demands on capital strength. A spokesman added: ""The plan agreed with Nationwide to meet the 3% leverage ratio in 2015 will not result in them restricting lending to the real economy. Therefore it is wrong to blame their SME decision on the regulator."" The lender's slowness to offer loans to SMEs will disappoint ministers concerned that small firms continue to be starved of credit. Nationwide's entry into the market has been seen by business secretary Vince Cable as a way to increase competition and break the dominance of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. However, regulators warned the lender had rapidly expanded its mortgage business while still wrestling with an overhang of bad commercial property loans. It was rebuked in July by the regulator, the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), for running an aggressive lending policy without adequate reserves to insure against a possible collapse. Analysts at credit ratings firm Standard & Poor's followed with a warning that a doubling in the losses on commercial property loans to £450m weakened the lender's financial position. S&P downgraded Nationwide's credit rating this month and signalled that further downgrades could follow without a rapid improvement. ""These impairment charges have hindered Nationwide's internal capital generation. As a result, we have revised down our assessment of its risk position to 'adequate' from 'strong',"" it said. The lender revealed plans to enter the SME loans market last year, where lending has shrunk as banks retreat and demand wanes. At the time boss Graham Beale described it as a ""natural extension of what we can do"". A Nationwide spokesman said: ""We have previously said that it is our strategic intention to enter the SME banking market and that we will do this at the right time for the society and our members. That remains our intention."" He said the lender was unable to give an official launch date. ""We have never talked about it being this year, just sometime in the future. We have never committed to a date."" The spokesman was reacting to a report in the Financial Times that a planned launch later for this year had been scrapped. The newspaper said it understood that a service offering loans to SMEs was unlikely to be ready before 2016."
304	305	Barclays allegations and inside the murky world of dark pools 	"Banks in the US and Europe created these pseudo exchanges to carry out transactions on behalf of big clients who wanted to conduct huge buy or sell deals without the price moving as the deal was done. The term ""dark pool"" was coined to sum up the opaque nature of these privately run platforms, which have become one of the main devices banks use to match buyers and sellers away from the main exchanges. They are computer-driven, and cheaper than sending buy and sell orders through the US's 13 public exchanges. Around 45 dark pools are in operation. The biggest are understood to be run by JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. There are several selling points. The trades tend to be large slugs of shares that would attract the attention of other large shareholders, either spooking them into selling their shares of encouraging them to buy more. Dark pools only report data after a trade has occurred. At that stage, information about the trade has little influence on the price. In the past investors who wanted to process a big trade would break it up into a number of smaller transactions – but algorithmic traders used computers to spot these trading patterns and prices were effected as they moved in to buy and sell at the same time. There was also a promise that high frequency traders – dubbed the great white sharks of the investment business in Michael Lewis's new book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt – and algorithmic traders would also be prevented from participating and incorporating dark pool trading in their computer-driven dealings. Lastly, there was the price tag. Banks promised to process trades at cheaper, bulk rates compared with rival big exchanges. This price promise has now attracted many smaller investors in search of a cheap transaction. Critics say dark pools are parasitic, largely unregulated and open to abuse. Parasitic because they price trades using data off the main exchanges. Unregulated because while banks must submit detailed accounts to regulators about their reserves and liabilities, dealing in client funds has been, to a great extent, a private affair – at least until there are complaints (see Barclays). They are open to abuse when the balance of information is uneven between the client and the matchmaker. The dark pool operator is in possession of very big, market-moving information on trades which they, or their staff, might front-run (ie deal in advance with inside knowledge). According to Reuters, dark pools now account for up to 40% of shares traded in the US, up from around 16% six years ago. John Ramsay, a former head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) trading and markets division, told reporters in February that dark pools were ""a real concern"". Without saying when regulators should intervene, he said: ""We have academic data now that suggests that, yes, in fact there is a point beyond which the level of dark trading for particular securities can really erode market quality."" Since then, and with added pressure of Lewis's book – in which he says the markets are effectively rigged in favour of banks and high frequency traders – it appears the SEC has been digging around to see what goes on. The UK bank is accused of ushering in the high-frequency traders to its secretive LX Liquidity Cross alternative trading system and letting them run riot. Or more precisely, let them bid on trades with clients without their knowledge. The New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said told customers who chose to trade in its dark pool that they would be protected from these ""predatory traders"", which use their speed advantage – processing trades through superfast fibre-optic cables – to deprive other investors of small profits on every trade. The bank courted high-frequency traders in part by charging them virtually nothing, Schneiderman claimed. In the months after the financial crash, regulators have worked to put exotic derivatives trading behind the sub-prime mortgage crash through open exchanges, where it can be monitored. Now it looks like the trading of shares, which has drifted away from the main exchanges in London, New York and Tokyo into dark pools,may need to be forced back onto the main exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq exchange have allowed brokerages to place dark pool-style orders on their platforms, with the trade hidden until after it is executed. This practice could be tackled by regulators."
315	316	The 2010 'flash crash': how it unfolded 	It was 6 May 2010. In the UK it was general election day, in the US,Wall Street was gripped by mounting anxiety about the Greek debt crisis. The euro was falling against the dollar and the yen, but despite the turbulent start to the trading day, no one had expected the near 1,000-point dive in share prices. In a matter of minutes the Dow Jones index lost almost 9% of its value – in a sequences of events that quickly became known as “flash crash” . Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off the share prices of household name companies like Proctor & Gamble and General Electric. But the carnage , which took place at a speed never before witnessed, did not last long. The market rapidly regained its composure and eventually closed 3% lower. There was a frenzy of speculation about what might have caused the rout, with explanations ranging from fat fingered trading to a cyberattack. But within days, officials in the US were blaming . By the end of September, an official report by the two main US regulators pointed to a $4.1bn (£2.7bn) sell order instigated by a US mutual fund, said to be Waddell & Reed. At 2.32 pm, the mutual fund had used an automated algorithm trading strategy to sell contracts known as e-minis. It was the largest change in the daily position of any investor so far that year and sparked selling by other traders, including high frequency traders. The by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission outlined a “hot potato” effect as the HFTs started and buying and then reselling the e-mini contracts. Some orders were executed at “irrational prices” as low as one penny or as high as $100,000 before the share prices returned to their pre-crash levels by 3pm. In just 20 minutes, 2bn shares worth $56bn had changed hands. 
336	337	Caroline Lucas: 'The Green movement has to talk about the positives' 	"aroline Lucas was standing for parliament the last time we met, and this time round she's standing trial. As far as I can establish, she's the first sitting MP to be prosecuted over a matter of principle since a Labour member refused to pay the poll tax 25 years ago – and she hasn't even been in the Commons for a full term yet. But her reason for risking arrest is exactly the same as the reason she ran for election: she is frightened that we're heading for environmental Armageddon. It's not exactly a reason to be cheerful – and we meet in her Brighton constituency this week just as air pollution began swaddling the country, only hours after warned that climate change is already wreaking havoc on the planet, causing heatwaves and floods. But if she was relentlessly cheerful last time round, this time she's practically Pollyannaish. Lucas must wait until 17 April for her trial to conclude, when she will discover whether magistrates find her guilty or not of last summer in Balcombe – so there are some legal constraints on what she can say now. But the more striking constraints are political, and she's stuck with them, regardless of the verdict. As the country's first MP, Lucas cannot afford to say that voters will have to forego some luxuries to combat climate change, because turkeys don't vote for Christmas. She can't acknowledge that Brighton's Green-led council may well have muffed up her re-election chances by making some howlingly unpopular mistakes. ""Um, it's maybe made it a bit more challenging."" She can't risk telling us bluntly that we're losing the fight against climate change, because then everyone would give up trying. And for obvious reasons, she can't say she was glad that so many of us spent the winter under water. ""But I can say that I hope it will have been a wake-up call."" What Lucas has to be is resolutely optimistic – and she is, doggedly, with a sort of heroic determination. Why she is on trial is still a puzzle to Lucas. She and other protesters had been sitting on a small off-road driveway in Balcombe for five hours last August, and were talking about leaving, when the police decided to arrest them. ""Another 15 minutes and we'd probably all have been gone."" So she is angry about that, but glad to be on trial, ""to the extent that the coverage can be about fracking. I was pleased about the protest overall, in the sense that it did put the spotlight again on fracking. If you look at opinion polls before and after that summer of protest, the numbers against fracking were much higher by the end, so I think it really raised awareness."" A local councillor told her that when the , ""And it felt really important to make sure that could never be a reason again."" For Lucas, the big problem with fracking has nothing to do with the risk that it will cause earthquakes, contaminate the water table or pollute the soil. In fact, she thinks it possible that stringent regulations could minimise those risks. ""It's not that fracking itself is necessarily worse than ordinary gas extraction. It's the fact that we're just about to put into place a whole new infrastructure for a whole new fossil-fuel industry, at exactly the time when we need to be reducing our emissions."" The problem, in other words, is climate change. Some environmentalists argue that shale gas is the obvious answer to our energy needs, until we've worked out how to power the country with renewables. Lucas accepts that we do need gas to tide us over, ""but I would prefer to keep importing it from Norway, for example, because it will be easier to turn that tap off than it would be to dismantle an entire new industry that we had deliberately incentivised. That's why Balcombe felt so important, because it is literally on the frontline."" It is a total myth, she insists, that fracking shale gas would bring down our energy prices. It has in the US, but she says any shale gas fracked in the UK would have no impact on our heating bills, and wouldn't even be used in this country, because we are locked into European energy prices. ""What will reduce prices is a significant investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Just exactly as the price of gas is going up, the price of renewables is coming down, and that's why there is such a fierce battle going on in places like the department of energy. I don't think we should be naive about this. There is a massive battle of vested interests going on, because the fossil fuel companies can see the writing on the wall – they can see that quite soon those renewable sources are going to be cheaper, and that is why we've had such a fightback from the nuclear industry, and such a fightback from companies like Cuadrilla, who absolutely don't want to see that."" When anyone talks about renewable energy I confess my spirits sag. The government's much-hyped Green Deal has been , who did the sums and decided they couldn't afford to make their homes more environmentally friendly after all. I'm one of them, and had got the impression that renewables were proving trickier to develop than hoped. This week it emerged that , and may even pledge to dismantle some in next year's manifesto. Many Tory voters may conclude that if even a government this committed to renewable energy can't make it work, then clearly it's just not possible? ""There is just such a cognitive dissonance – I suppose hypocrisy is a better way of putting it – between what the government says, and what it does. What evidence do you have, beyond the rhetoric, that David Cameron is remotely interested in the green agenda? He's got Owen Paterson as his environment secretary, for heavens' sake, who doesn't even think that climate change is a problem! Everyone can look back on and see it for the photo opportunity that it was. It was a very clever way of detoxifying the Tory brand at the time. To talk about closing wind farms in this of all weeks, the very week of the IPPC report, I think shows the Tories in their true colours, and just shows that 'Vote blue, get green' meant nothing. The government seems to have an ideological opposition to renewable energy."" Even more revealing, Lucas thinks, is the news this week that the government intends to alter the law of trespass, to allow shale gas to be fracked underneath private land even without the owner's permission. ""The government obviously feels that it is not going to be able to win the argument, so it's going to take away people's right to decide what happens under their own homes. And this was a government that came to power championing localism!"" How does she explain it? ""The only answer I have is that the fossil fuel companies have a direct line to government."" More than 50 energy company employees have been seconded to the government free of charge, and dozens of them to the department of energy and climate change. ""They're not doing that out of the goodness of their hearts. They're doing it because they want to shape the kind of policy that comes out of it – and frankly they're doing a rather good job. I cannot come up with another answer for why government would look evidence in the face and turn its back on it."" When the evidence on climate change is as bleak as it looks in the latest IPCC report, Lucas doesn't blame the public for wanting to look away in despair. We've been reading IPCC reports for quarter of a century – and she admits that ""essentially it's been the same story for 25 years. Increasingly, we are recognising that the science is not what's going to move this. To me the really interesting thing about climate change right now is less about the science and much more about psychology. I think the green movement has learned the hard way that handing out small print leaflets saying 'If we don't change soon then we're all doomed' is not an effective way of getting people to change. So I think there's a much greater emphasis now within the Green party and the green movement about talking about the positives."" Her favourite cartoon shows a lecturer giving a presentation about what a low-emissions society would look like – sustainability, more livable cities, cleaner air, healthier kids etc – and an audience member asking, 'But what if climate change is a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?' ""I'm a great believer in needing things that give us some hope,"" Lucas smiles. ""With a positive vision of the benefits then I think we'll have a much better chance of bringing people with us."" She is probably right. But the imperative of positivity makes it hard to know exactly what she thinks. She smiles an awful lot, but would have to be a saint to feel this permanently cheerful in private, so I try to guess how she really feels by timing the pauses that often preface her smiley answers. After four years in parliament, I ask if she feels more or less optimistic that politicians will do what is necessary to combat climate change – and I count more than six seconds of silence before her reply. ""I suppose I get a sense that we can build coalitions, and that with enough political will, things can change. That's been quite interesting to see up-front."" There has been some great collaborative work between her party and the trade unions, she goes on hopefully. But when pressed, it transpires that Ed Miliband has had a grand total of two meetings with Lucas since she was elected – and Cameron has not spoken to her once. She has been staggered by the lack of legislative scrutiny in Westminster, and by the stunning inefficiency of the entire system. ""Parliamentary reform has gone right up my list of priorities,"" she grins. For 12 years before her election to the Commons, Lucas was an MEP, ""and I never thought I would say this, but in some respects the European parliament is more efficient than Westminster"". She must have had moments when she's questioned the point of her being there at all. ""Um … No, I haven't thought that, because it's so important that the Greens have a place. We've had much more coverage, it's been an amplifier. And I can take a position that helps shift the other parties. I see my role very much as being there to hold their feet to the fire. It feels important, and that matters. I didn't do this because I thought it was fun,"" she smiles, ""but because I thought it was important."" The funny thing is, Lucas reflects, smiling again, that she has been trying for years to work out where the real power lies: ""And it always seems to be where I'm not."" She didn't find it on Oxfordshire county council in the 90s, nor in Strasbourg, nor now in Westminster. She feels hopeful about her party's prospects in next month's European elections, and urges any supporters worried about wasting their vote in next year's election to remember that if everyone in Brighton had done the same, her party still wouldn't have a single MP. But she also recalls something Miliband said when he was climate change minister. ""There he was, the minister – which you would have thought made him influential – appealing for NGOs to organise a campaign that would give him permission to mobilise in government."" Does she mean she might well have been more powerful sitting down on the pathway in Balcombe than she can be on the House of Commons benches? Sometimes I wish Lucas would be a bit less cautiously cheerful, and just let rip about what's wrong with our political system. But after a few seconds' pause she says. ""No, no, I think the two are complementary."""
341	342	Mark Carney won't rule out pre-election interest rate rise 	"Interest rates could rise before the next election, according to governor Mark Carney, who said that higher rates would be a ""welcome sign"" that the economy was recovering. In an , Carney said interest rate rises would be ""gradual"" as the economy improved. ""We are one year into a recovery, but it is an uneven recovery,"" the governor said. ""Our job is to help turn this into a strong, sustainable and balanced expansion"" for the country as a whole. He added: ""There is still slack in the labour market. You can see that here and right across the country. We need to use up more of that slack before we raise rates."" Asked if he would rule out an increase before the election next spring, he said: ""No, absolutely not. We will set policy as appropriate to meet our core responsibility to meet the 2% inflation target. We haven't set timing conditions on when that will be. But we are absolutely clear that it will happen independent of the political cycle."" He said the rate rises would be confirmation the economy was recovering after some difficult years. ""I'm not sure we will get a lot of cards or letters to thank us, but we will do it when it needs to happen."" The Bank of England has postponed its May 2015 meeting so it does not coincide with the election. The to the afternoon of Friday 8 May and continue on the following Monday morning, with a decision due to be announced at noon on the Monday after the election. On his first visit to the north-east of England, where he met business leaders and GCSE economics students, Carney also said bankers needed to do more to salvage their tarnished public reputation. ""I'm not sure bankers need to wear sackcloth, but nor should they jump back into wearing Gucci suits,"" he said. ""There needs to be an improvement in terms of banker conduct. Some institutions have made real progress but it needs to be industry wide. Banking needs to be treated more as a profession. We also need to improve infrastructure, both in how markets are organised and the codes of conduct behind markets."""
348	349	Jon Finch 	"In the 1970s, it seemed a sure bet that the actor Jon Finch, who has died aged 70, would become a durable film star of some magnitude. He had the dark good looks, the voice, the charisma and the opportunities. At the beginning of his film career, he played the title role in Roman Polanski's The Tragedy of Macbeth (1971) and starred in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy (1972). Around the same time he was offered the chance to replace Sean Connery as James Bond in Live and Let Die (1973). The fact that Finch turned the part down stupefied many commentators. That Finch never achieved the level of stardom that was anticipated may be attributed to his dislike of the kind of media publicity that goes with it and his self-proclaimed lack of ambition. ""I never wanted to be a big star,"" Finch once said. ""I usually do one film a year, so I always have enough money to enjoy myself and keep myself out of the public eye. It's a very pleasant life, not one of great ambition."" Actually, leaving aside the great expectations, Finch's career was a reasonably successful one by normal standards. Finch was born in Caterham, Surrey, the son of a merchant banker. He first started acting at school, later gaining experience in amateur theatre groups. After serving in a parachute regiment during his military service, he joined an SAS reserve regiment. ""I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the SAS and I'm still very proud of having been a member,"" he recalled. ""But eventually I had to leave because I was becoming more and more involved in the theatre and the SAS demands most of your weekends and several nights a week."" Finch had started acting professionally with several different repertory companies around the UK before he got a part in Crossroads, the popular daytime soap, during its first run in 1964. Finch then appeared in Z-Cars (1967-68) and in 10 episodes of Counterstrike (1969), a short-lived BBC sci-fi series about an alien (Finch) sent to Earth to save it from extinction. His film career began in two hammy Hammer horrors, The Vampire Lovers and The Horror of Frankenstein (both 1970). Polanski, who had made his own comic horror movie, The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967), thought Finch had the credentials to play Macbeth. There were those who thought it in bad taste that Polanski made a film of the most blood-soaked of all Shakespeare's plays just two years after his wife, Sharon Tate, had been murdered by the followers of Charles Manson. Finch and Francesca Annis, as the Macbeths, were impressively youthful, tortured and impassioned. Equally outraged and baffled as a bitter ex-RAF hero down on his luck, Finch subtly avoided the temptation to be sympathetic as ""the wrong man"" accused of being the ""neck-tie strangler"" in Frenzy, Hitchcock's first film shot in England for 16 years. He was quietly authoritative as the cuckolded politician Lord Melbourne in Robert Bolt's Lady Caroline Lamb (1973), in a role that had first been offered to Timothy Dalton, a future James Bond. Around the same time, Finch declined the Bond offer, as well as one from Richard Lester to play Aramis in The Three Musketeers. He preferred real-life derring-do – motor racing and parachuting. But in 1976, Finch discovered that he had diabetes. A few years later, he remarked: ""I am over all the trauma of it now and, apart from motor racing, parachuting and a few other things, I can still do what I want. I have plenty of energy for the parts I play and I just thank God for the discovery of insulin, otherwise I'd be dead."" Although he turned down the part of Doyle (eventually taken by Martin Shaw) in London Weekend's The Professionals (1977), claiming curiously that he ""couldn't possibly play a policeman,"" Finch continued to appear regularly on television and in films. These included Death on the Nile (1978), based on Agatha Christie, in which he played a Marxist who resents the wealth of some of the other suspects. However, he had to drop out when he fell ill on the first day of filming of Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) and was replaced by John Hurt. Regarded by Finch as the highlight of his career was his powerful portrayal of Henry Bolingbroke in Richard II (1978), and Henry IV (parts one and two) (1979) in the BBC's Shakespeare History Cycle. He was later a nobly played and spoken Don Pedro in the BBC's Much Ado About Nothing (1984). In 1980, Finch married the actor Catriona MacColl, with whom he co-starred in a minor Spanish film, Power Game (1983). They divorced in 1987. Finch was seen in various television series throughout the 90s. His last film role was as the Catholic Patriarch of Jerusalem in Kingdom of Heaven (2005); in which he finally got to work for Ridley Scott. Finch is survived by his daughter, Holly. Jon Finch, actor, born 2 March 1942; found dead 28 December 2012 This article was amended on 13 and 14 January 2013. A reference to ""a severe attack of diabetes"" was replaced by one to Finch falling ill. His year of birth was initially given as 1941."
356	357	Ian McKellen: 'Gandalf the Grey likes boogieing around Hobbiton and having a drink' 	"t's not quite a hole in the ground and Gandalf is not – yet – blowing complex smoke rings of dragons chasing pirate ships, but there is a still a welcomely ruminative, smoky, timeless ambience. We are sitting, Mr and I – he's not one of those who goes too big on the ""Sir"" stuff – in the tiny top room of the ancient waterside Limehouse pub the Grapes, which he co-bought a couple of years ago. There are candles, there are golds and reds, there's a big mutual ashtray, and outside the shaking windows the dirty Thames is growing darker, wilder and woollier by the minute. He is talking of Dickens, who wrote about this place, very possibly this high room, as ""forever falling into the water"". I am thinking, more, about my first meeting with Mr McKellen, something like 35 years ago, when I interviewed him for my school magazine, the RSC having played in our school gym that Edinburgh festival. With incalculable luck I've managed to dig out a copy, just to remind myself what badly Xeroxed typewriting looks like and how excruciating my interview technique was even back then – it's simple Q&A, and fawning questions, but one does stand out between his (lengthy, thoughtful, unpatronising) answers, and it runs thus: ""Q: Have you ever thought seriously about going into films or television?"" Today we both wear specs – neither pair too effective in the darkling light from the stormy windows; he's delighted by the half-memory and takes the photocopy of my photocopy to pore over later. We can forgive much about our younger selves, but that question in particular does seem daft, given that the man before me is about to star in probably the year's greatest blockbuster, , reprising – or is ""preprising"" yet a word? – the role of Tolkien's wizard which won him worldwide fame over the past decade during the slow, complex and ultimately triumphant New Zealand filmings of the author's later . ""I do think I used to be a bit snobbish about the cinema and think the real acting took place in the theatre,"" he muses as he tries to remember what the answer had been (he'd said then: ""I've never met a film star who's happy…""). ""But perhaps that was simply excusing my disappointment that I wasn't in cinema like some of my contemporaries – , , latterly . My friends tell me I was saying: 'Why aren't in movies?', but I wasn't because I was always on tour, on stage. And also, because of that, I knew I had to how to be a film actor. And so when I'd set up the film of I deliberately took very small jobs in other people's movies – , for goodness' sake, – and I just began to see what they were up to, so that when it came to the real thing I felt that bit more confident. And I suppose it was a good calling card, so producers could go: 'Hmm, maybe McKellen's a bit more than just a classical stage actor.'"" He has loved the transition to movie superstar at a relatively mellow age – he's now 73. ""It's easier to go from theatre to film than the other way round. In film you're absolutely loved and cossetted and cared for. In film your director makes your performance. In theatre you're carrying it all. But films appeal to me because I'm still intrigued by how to do them. I'm so pleased that I seem to be able to act in films, not waving and shouting too much, just to be heard in the gods."" And he didn't, as many seem to, mind the concomitant fame? ""Goodness no. And I travel on the tube. What's nice for me, having identified myself for years as being rather shy, is now, wherever I am, in public, there tends to be a friendly face who's pleased to see me, and I like that. And for someone who doesn't have grandchildren, it's lovely for me to meet those of friends, eight or nine years old, who actually want to have a chat to me – that's great. And yes, they absolutely understand I'm not Gandalf, I'm only an actor. All the world's a stage etc, and kids are so used to play-acting anyway: they absolutely get it, no problem. Sometimes they might say: 'Will you sign this as Gandalf?' and I say: 'Well, no, Gandalf isn't here,' and they go: 'Of course.'"" There is, between the two of Tolkien's filmed books, a difference not only in size but in mood. Filming for finished mainly in July, though McKellen has to go back Down Under for five weeks next year for extra scenes. Since then he's been back in London, catching up with friends, settling into running a pub within sight of his home, and learning – in his words – that chefs can be every bit as ""difficult bloody divas"" as actors. Presumably the end result, the long-awaited , reflects the mood of the writing? ""Absolutely. Tolkien wrote first, and wrote it mainly as a simple adventure story. It was written almost in the first person, his own voice, and it's a tale of the old world, and Bilbo is simply going on an adventure. In it's war, written as real war loomed, and they're going off to save the world: it's big and it's serious. ""But this one is full of fun, and humour, in a way which wouldn't really have been appropriate in . ] is, apart from anything else, a great comedian, as, of course, are , , . Also, in this one I am, throughout, Gandalf the Grey. In , two of them anyway, I play Gandalf the White, kind of post-resurrection, and there's a different feel to him; a certainty. But Gandalf the Grey likes boogieing around Hobbiton and having a drink and a smoke and letting off fireworks."" As, it strikes me, does McKellen himself in his fashion, who is just about to start work on a sitcom with , about, essentially, two argumentative old queens living in Soho. ""Well, you know, I just hadn't done a sitcom before. Hadn't worked with Derek before, oddly, even though we've known each other since Cambridge, and it seemed a bit of a lark, and the writing is funny, better than funny. And we are capable of absorbing each other's cantankerousness – the characters have been together for 50 years, so there's a basis of love which supersedes the viciousness, as with heterosexual marriages."" It is still a risk, however – a prime-time ITV sitcom, filmed live before an audience. You're never too old to fail. And it strikes me that something has changed from the McKellen who told the a decade ago that he was happily in love, and considering winding down, and travelling much more, and letting go more than a little. What had happened? Was he, for instance, still with the same chap? ""No, no, I'm on my own."" Happily so? ""That, for the , is rather a cheeky question, but I suppose yes. If I wasn't I'd presumably go out and do something about it. But, on your wider note, it turned out that despite travel and the other things, gratifying as they are and were, I still to act. That's what I'm best at. And as long as other people want to go on employing me, in capacity, it would be perverse not to. It keeps you alert, part of the world – you're not forever being nostalgic… you don't decline into self-satisfaction. Now rather than thinking: 'When can I take six months off?', it's: 'When can I work again, by God how much time do I have left, I'd better do another job.'"" Ten years ago, he says, he probably gave that answer to us because he was around retiring age and thought he should be winding down, rather than actually meaning it. ""Actors don't, in fact, retire, do they? It took me a while to remember that. And the fact that I'd always wanted to have a . Those I admired – and , – they'd all had careers, not just famous for one thing; they'd had their ups and downs but they'd always kept going. And there's always the sense of… not much longer for this part. At one age it's: 'Hell, not much longer to play Romeo, or Hamlet,' then it's soon: 'I'm going to be too old for Macbeth.' All right, Lear's always there."" Part of the key to longevity must surely be adaptability. ""Yes, but that's not a problem, because that's been part of the fascination for me, always, in any medium."" First, he says, having loved listening to the radio, he was simply delighted to be on it to find out how it was done. ""Then television, and how is it ? Why and how did they go for shot? So I would never find myself saying: 'Oh I can't do that, it involves something new'. Rather, I hope I'm intrigued by it. Not to say I find something like , say, necessarily easy, but it can be coped with. Like so much of acting, it's to do with technique. ""Perhaps in the past I've been too technical an actor – well, other people have said it of me – but if you're making you've got to know how to cope with the problem of making yourself look much larger than all the other characters. Even when they're not there."" He is, for instance, technically taller than but not by much more than a jug of Bree's finest hobbit ale. ""So I have to act with Martin, when we're actually together, looking at his belt, and he has to act looking at the top of my hat, and then to the camera it looks as if he's much smaller. But it's all just technique, similar to coming on to a stage and hitting your mark, making sure you're in the light and the rest, just a bit more of it."" Are you still learning? ""Oh good lord, yes, absolutely. I might have thought, when younger: 'Right, I think I've pretty much now sorted out how to do, say, .' But that's about it. Always, I'm still learning. I hope. And I feel that more and more, as I age. Anyone of my age feels that the end is… in touchable distance. And who knows, it may suddenly come up behind and hit you on the head. And your friends are… dying, or incapacitated in some way. And I think I've decided now that I'd rather like to keep going, as far and as long as I can."" And ideally, he says, with parts where he can bring something of himself – he'd still love, he says incidentally, to do something with – because ""that's part of the fun, always part of the fun. With Shakespeare, for instance, you have to think: 'Can I imagine myself doing this? What within me would support doing this? Can I actually imagine killing Duncan?' Well, I can certainly understand the motives, the confusions. And personally I know about guilt, and paranoia, and regret."" All parts, even Gandalf? ""Well, aspects, most certainly. He likes going out. Likes laying down the law. I love both, on occasion, with… yes, benign affectionate tetchiness. I don't have Gandalf the White's certainty about everything."" Perhaps, I suggest, because he doesn't echo his quasi-religious feel, having eschewed religion in this real world. ""That is a part of it. What I do have is Gandalf the Grey's ability to worry about things. There's got to be some truth of you in all the best parts. And that's why I did enjoy it all so. That and, to be honest, the fact that I still get a bit starstruck. I can't believe my luck! I'm in a room with Billy Connolly, touching him, hugging him, and he's teaching me how to play the banjolele, which he gave me. Chatting to Stephen Fry, for free, and they're nice to me, think I have something to offer. And young people, too, offering me the time of day. What a business to be in, and to still be in!"" He gives a sonorous chortle that seems to rattle rafters; and there's genuine self-deprecation at his luck in finding himself in such company. I suspect that messrs Fry and Connolly – who grew up watching this man segue from gar- landed stage-thesp to tireless campaigner (Stonewall, women's and children's rights) to Hollywood catnip to that dreadful position for anyone with a fine remaining sense of mischief: being on the cusp of national-treasure status – were equally conscious of the company they were in. But he wants briefly to be back with wizards. ""Gandalf is trying to do . And basically I'm on the side of people trying to make this world a better place. Rather than keep it as it was, or even imagining a golden future. But simply getting through life without hurting too many people."" Are we in a better world than the one into which he was born? ""Entirely better, personally. At least in the country we live in, there's an acceptance and a generosity and inclusiveness which has allowed us to accept alien cultures and learn from them. And attitudes to gay culture, and then disability, I hope more than momentarily. In so many ways better, and I am so glad."" He's late to return to his house guests, so courteously takes his leave, pausing to check with his manager about early Christmas bookings, cast an eye over table settings and compliment her on her looks, then bounce away dangerously fast down rickety stairs after a winning and grinning handshake. A rounded, grounded man, who seems determined to the end to pull out a few fresh stops, happy just to be given the chance, and maybe just blow a few more dragons after a few more pirate ships. ."
362	363	Sir Ian McKellen v Damian Lewis: actors trade blows 	"Sir has hit back at Damian Lewis after the Homeland star said he did not want to end up a ""fruity actor"" known for playing wizards. McKellen, who reprises his role as Gandalf in the , said ""no one needs to feel sorry for me"" after Lewis alluded to his career as one of the reasons why he wanted to break out of the theatre. Lewis, , said he worried in his 20s that he would be ""one of these slightly over-the-top, fruity actors who would have an illustrious career on stage, but wouldn't start getting any kind of film work until I was 50 and then start playing wizards"". McKellen was forthright in his response but, like Lewis, declined to name names. ""I wouldn't like to have been one of those actors who hit stardom quite early on and expected it to continue and was stuck doing scripts that I didn't particularly like just to keep the income up,"" he told the Radio Times. ""I've always wanted to get better as an actor. And I have got better. You've only got to see my early work to see that."" He added: ""As for a fruity voice? Well, it may be a voice that is trained like an opera singer's voice: to fill a large space. It is unnatural. ""Actors have to be heard and their voice may therefore develop a sonorous quality that they can't quite get rid of, so you think actors are as pompous as their voice is large. I suppose Damian was thinking of that a little bit, too."" McKellen, who described Lewis's remarks as ""fair comment"", said: ""No one needs to feel sorry for me or Michael Gambon [who played Professor Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movies] or anyone else who has fallen victim to success."" Currently starring in two plays on Broadway in New York, he admitted his performance in the , in which he played one half of a gay couple opposite his good friend Derek Jacobi, was ""over the top"", saying he was acting too much for the live studio audience. McKellen, 74, who came out in 1988, said he had sympathy for gay A-list stars who decide to keep their sexuality a secret. ""It's true of A-lists all over the world – A-list priests, A-list politicians. What will other people think? Will people still vote for me? Will people come and see me act?"" he said. ""They're warned by the people who surround them – agents and managers, who have a living to make and are worried that the actor will get pigeonholed. ""I don't think the audience gives a damn … You don't have to be straight to play Gandalf. Anyway, who says that Gandalf isn't gay? I loved it when ."" McKellen said he had been advised by the Foreign Office not to go to Russia because of its laws on homosexuality. ""They couldn't protect me from those laws. Two and a half hours from London! In the land of Tchaikovsky, Diaghilev, Rudolf Nureyev – gay artists whose sexuality informed their work,"" he said. ""Imagine trying to be a gay actor, a gay anything in modern Russia? Where to be positively oneself, to be affectionate in public with someone you love of the same gender, or to talk of that love in the hearing of anyone under 18, will put you prison?"""
366	367	Twitter bomb threats made against more women in public eye 	"Two more well-known women on have received bomb threats, as the historian Mary Beard called for repeated threats of violence and death against her and other women using the site to be distinguished from mere abuse. The journalists India Knight and Laurie Penny became the latest users to receive bomb threats after similar tweets were also , as the campaign of attacks on Twitter against women who highlight online abuse continued. Penny, who expressed her frustration at having to waste part of her working day reporting the threat, and later told followers: ""Police are here now and being very helpful. Am being advised to stay elsewhere tonight; have already sorted that out."" Knight meanwhile : ""Very grateful to @metpoliceuk, but officers wouldn't have to waste their time if @twitter could deal w this crap."" Beard, who contacted police on Sunday after receiving a message claiming a bomb had been left outside her home, told BBC Breakfast today that she has since received further threats on Twitter claiming that the originals were ""just a practice run"". Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman, Independent columnist Grace Dent and Europe editor of Time magazine Catherine Mayer, as well as a number of other women, have previously said they had been the subject of bomb threats on the site, while a number have received threats of rape. Beard said: ""I've had lots of abuse, but only recently have I had these things actually threatening violence rape and death. ""I think we've got to be quite careful about drawing a distinction between those things because abuse is very nasty, it's sexist, it's misogynist but I think in some ways you can cope with that by naming and shaming. ""That's what I have quite often done – earlier this week I retweeted one lad's Twitter threat and someone threatened to tell his mum and that sort of solved it. ""I think you have to be absolutely clear that these threats that have been coming to me and to other women and also, I have to say, to women who aren't lucky or unlucky enough to be in the public eye – these are criminal threats, they are threats of violence and death and all you can do is take them to the police. ""There is no two ways about it, threatening to kill someone is a crime and that's what I and other people have done and I hope other women who get these threats will do the same."" Beard said that although Twitter had been slow off the mark to address the issue, she was happy with the support she received from the site in the last 24 hours. , Twitter's UK general manager, posted a series of tweets yesterday saying abuse was ""simply not acceptable"". His messages came after the website clarified its rules on abusive behaviour and put extra staff in place to handle reports of abuse. Scotland Yard said that it has launched an investigation into eight allegations of online abuse and threats. ""Detectives from the specialist organised & economic crime command have taken responsibility for the investigations into a number of allegations recently made to the MPS relating to allegations of malicious communication made on the social networking site Twitter,"" the Met said in a statement. ""The police central e-crime unit (PCeU), who hold the police national cybercrime remit, is now investigating allegations made by eight people that they have been subject to harassment, malicious communication or bomb threats."""
367	368	The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - review 	" has picked up the pace. He began his Hobbit trilogy at an amiable, meanderingly wayward canter, and tried the patience of believers and non-believers alike with that initial supper scene, almost an epic in itself. But this second episode commences with a narrative whipcrack – a quick flashback to Gandalf and Thorin tensely discussing their great plan in the snug bar of the Prancing Pony – and then we're off, at a tremendous gallop. The Desolation of Smaug is a cheerfully entertaining and exhilarating adventure tale, a supercharged Saturday morning picture: it's mysterious and strange and yet Jackson also effortlessly conjures up that genial quality that distinguishes The Hobbit from the more solemn Rings stories. The absurdity is winning: you're laughing with, not laughing at. For me, it never sagged once in its mighty two hour 40 minutes running time and the high-frame-rate projection for this film somehow looks richer and denser than it did the last time around. Maybe I'm just getting used to it. Jackson has shown that he is an expert in big-league popular movie-making to rival Lucas and Spielberg. His Smaug, with its fight scenes, chase spectaculars, creepy creatures and secret stone doors opening with a grinding noise, is something to set alongside the Indiana Jones films. The end of the second movie out of three gives us a chance to revisit that critical question: does The Hobbit story work at this great length? Does epic-i-sation risk making The Hobbit too dour? In the book itself, Tolkien wrote: ""Things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway."" So perhaps Tolkien anticipated the way in which fantasy can grow exponentially, spinning substance out of itself, and become more and more serious and even solemn. Yet this second Hobbit film has real energy and charm. Smaug is of course the terrible dragon, voiced by , who has usurped the Lonely Mountain and the dwarf kingdom of Erebor with all its gold, and whom the dwarves and Bilbo Baggins are on a mission to unseat. The ""desolation"" is the wasteland he has imposed on the country thereabouts, rather than any depression the dragon himself may be feeling. Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) is the alpha dwarf, grimly intent on his destiny: to reclaim his people's heritage and homeland. Martin Freeman is Bilbo, and Freeman's laidback, more naturalistic line-readings make a pleasing and interesting contrast to the more contoured saga-speak that comes out of everyone else's mouth, whether they are speaking English or Elvish or the guttural Orc tongue. Bilbo is reluctant to confide the truth about the ring in his possession to Ian McKellen's Gandalf, who absents himself from the party reasonably early on, leaving that visually striking group looking and feeling vulnerable. Poor little Bilbo playing a non-Snow-White to the even littler dwarves as they trail across the magnificent landscape – but who are in fact tougher, more aggressive and more resilient than him. A series of bizarre fantasy episodes, in a kind of Jackson-Tolkien-rococo style, brings us closer and closer to the mountain. The dwarves encounter Beorn the skin-changer who agrees, albeit churlishly, to help. The company finds itself lost and somehow spiritually oppressed in the forest of Mirkwood in which they get up close and personal with some colossal and very nasty spiders, which loom out of the screen in three dimensions, encasing their prisoners with skin-crawling webs. But the most uproarious setpiece comes when Bilbo, Thorin and the dwarves escape from the wood-elves' prison by hiding in barrels that are washed away down the river – which will bring them in contact with Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) and then the vain, shifty and time-serving Lord of Laketown, enjoyably played by Stephen Fry. The barrel-chase down the river is a great sequence: a full-tilt headspinning action spectacular with orc against elf against dwarf-and-hobbit. Somehow, the whole movie has this same huge propulsive energy, whooshing the heroes onwards towards their great goal. Despite the dwarves' tough reputations, and Bilbo's expertise in the ignoble art of burglary, their diminutive size always gives them a weirdly childlike air: an air of outraged and unquenchable innocence. Bilbo's showdown with the terrible Smaug himself is of course the great finale, a narrative rhyme to his faceoff with Gollum that concluded the last film, and a satisfyingly exotic event. And all the time, Jackson's New Zealand landscape has a storybook beauty, a fitting habitat for this story which unfolds in all seasons and times of day: fallen snowflakes gather in beards, the last rays of sunset glints in fur. Jackson depicts this fantasy world with style and gusto, and I'm looking forward to the third film already."
373	374	Labour MP Stella Creasy receives Twitter rape threats 	"Twitter has come under increasing pressure to review its abuse-reporting systems after the Labour MP was threatened with rape for supporting the feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez. Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow in east London, retweeted some of the messages she had received on the micro-blogging site, adding that such behaviour would have consequences. ""You better watch your back....Im gonna rape your ass at 8pm and put the video all over the internet,"" . : ""If I meet you in an alley you will definitely get fucked."" Creasy used to inform the police of the threats, warn her abusers that she was logging their threats and taking screen grabs as evidence. ""You send me a rape threat you morons I will report you to the police & ensure action taken,"" . Creasy spoke out as attracted almost 60,000 signatures, and a day after in connection with Twitter threats made to Criado-Perez after she succeeded in her campaign to have the image of a woman, Jane Austen, used on a new bank note. The 21-year-old was arrested in Manchester on suspicion of harassment offences following a complaint made on Thursday. On Monday, Twitter said it had introduced a button for reporting abuse on its latest iPhone app and was looking at expanding this function. A spokesman said: ""The ability to report individual tweets for abuse is currently available on Twitter for iPhone, and we plan to bring this functionality to other platforms, including Android and the web. ""We don't comment on individual accounts. However, we have rules which people agree to abide by when they sign up to Twitter. ""We will suspend accounts that, once reported to us, are found to be in breach of our rules. We encourage users to report an account for violation of the Twitter rules by using one of our report forms."" The response is unlikely to satisfy some critics who have already said the iPhone button is inadequate as it links to a complex form and does not allow reports of multiple abuse tweets. Criado-Perez, who has received support from MPs and celebrities, said: ""It's sadly not unusual to get this kind of abuse but I've never seen it get as intense or aggressive as this. ""It's infuriating that the price you pay for standing up for women is 24 hours of rape threats. We are showing that by standing together we can make a real difference. ""We made the Bank of England change its mind, we can do the same with Twitter."" Criado-Perez, a freelance journalist, organised a campaign which included a petition signed by more than 35,500 people after the Bank of England decided to replace Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on new £5 notes. The move would have meant there were no women apart from the Queen on sterling banknotes. Her campaign was a success, with the bank announcing last week that Austen would feature on the new £10 when it is introduced in 2017. Tony Wang, the general manager of Twitter UK, said the company took online abuse seriously. He tweeted: ""We encourage users to report an account for violation of the Twitter rules by using one of our report forms. ""Also, we're testing ways to simplify reporting, eg within a tweet by using the 'Report Tweet' button in our iPhone app and on mobile web. We will suspend accounts that, once reported to us, are found to be in breach of our rules."" The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has written to Wang made about Criado-Perez on the site. She wrote: ""Despite the scale and seriousness of these threats, the official response from Twitter continues to be extremely weak – simply directing Caroline away from Twitter towards the police, and, belatedly, directing users to abuse reporting forms on Twitter. ""Of course it is right to report such abuse to the police, and it is very important that they investigate and pursue this case. ""But social media platforms also have a responsibility for the platform they give users. And in particular they have a responsibility not to tolerate this kind of abuse, rape threats and potentially criminal behaviour."" She added: ""The response by Twitter has clearly been inadequate and fails not only Caroline, but many more women and girls who have faced similar abuse on your social network. ""More than 20,000 people have already signed an online petition asking Twitter to allow users to report abuse directly with one click. ""I urge you to go further and ensure that Twitter carries out a full review of all its policies on abusive behaviour, threats and crimes, including more help for Twitter users who experience abuse, a clear complaints process and clear action from Twitter to tackle this kind of persecution."""
376	377	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey – review 	"""Unexpected"" is right, for a couple of reasons. , the man who brought Lord Of The Rings to the big screen to eardrum-shattering acclaim 10 years ago, is now taking just the same approach to Tolkien's much slighter, slimmer children's book The Hobbit. It's getting expanded into three movie episodes of which this whoppingly long film is the opener. So Tolkien's gentle tale is going to be a triple box-office bonanza, occupying the same amount of space as the mighty Rings epic, an effect achieved by pumping up the confrontations, opening out the backstory and amplifying the ambient details, like zooming in on a Google Middle Earth. The second unexpected point is the look of the thing. Jackson has pioneeringly shot The Hobbit in HFR, or High Frame Rate: 48 frames a second, as opposed to the traditional 24, giving a much higher definition and smoother ""movement"" effect. But it looks uncomfortably like telly, albeit telly shot with impossibly high production values and in immersive 3D. Before you grow accustomed to this, it feels as if there has been a terrible mistake in the projection room and they are showing us the video location report from the DVD ""making of"" featurette, rather than the actual film. There can be no doubt that Jackson has made The Hobbit with brio and fun, and is just right as Bilbo Baggins: he plays it with understatement and charm. But I had the weird, residual sense that I was watching an exceptionally expensive, imaginative and starry BBC Television drama production, the sort that goes out on Christmas Day, with 10 pages of coverage in the seasonal Radio Times, and perhaps a break in the middle for the Queen's Speech. Well, it grows on you. The HFR style has immediacy and glitter, particularly in the outdoor locations, where the New Zealand landscapes, in all their splendour, are revealed more sharply and clearly, and there is an almost documentary realism to the fable. Indoors though, it's not quite the same story. We approach the drama via its mythic setup: the terrifying dragon Smaug appropriates the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor. The older hobbit, played with maundering geniality by Ian Holm is presented to us; then it's back in time to meet our unlikely hero, the gentle Bilbo Baggins, younger but still a somewhat donnish, bookish bachelor figure like Tolkien and CS Lewis. He is contacted by the charismatic Wizard Gandalf The Grey — and it's a pleasure to see back in the cloak, whiskers and pointy hat, bringing a sparkle of life and fun to the part, and stealing the scene with ruminative little smiles and eyebrow-raisings. Under Gandalf's influence, Bilbo is forced to confront his destiny as a hobbit of action, and acquaints himself with the robust warrior class of dwarves. There's a nice performance from Ken Stott as Balin, with an outrageous big purple-ish nose, as if he's spent his time in exile drinking malt whisky. They are led by the mighty and taller warrior Thorin, played by Richard Armitage. And so the quest begins, and the questers come across such familiar figures as Galadriel – a seraphic and almost immobile Cate Blanchett – and Saruman, played with impassive dignity and presence, of course, by Christopher Lee. But soon they must tackle the evil Orcs. There are explosively dramatic battles, with a lot of 3D plunging from vertiginous heights. But the crux comes with Bilbo's meeting with the ineffably creepy Gollum, played in motion-capture once again by Andy Serkis. It is a terrific scene, a contest of nerves, a duel of wits, and the one moment in the film where the drama really comes alive and Freeman's (admirable) underplaying of the role works well against Serkis's animal paranoia. There is also something quietly affecting in Gandalf's moral strategy in recruiting Bilbo: ""I found it is the small things, everyday deeds of ordinary folk, that keeps the darkness at bay. Simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is because I'm afraid, and he gives me courage."" And the rest of the film offers an enormous amount of fun, energy and a bold sense of purpose. But after 170 minutes I felt that I had had enough of a pretty good thing. The trilogy will test the stamina of the non-believers, and many might feel, in their secret heart of hearts, that the traditional filmic look of was better. But if anyone can make us love the new epically supercharged HFR Hobbit, it's Peter Jackson."
384	385	Richard Curtis: 'About Time will probably be the last film I direct' 	", the British writer-director behind some of the most successful romcoms of all time, is considering retirement. Curtis, who is only 56, said science-fiction project felt like ""a summing up"" for a career which has taken in the legendary TV comedy , writing work on 1994's and 1999's , as well as the directing of 2003's . He told : ""I waited a while in order to write [About Time]. This probably will be the last film I will direct."" Asked to expand on that bombshell, he responded: ""I don't know. Just a feeling … just a feeling. It feels like a summing up to me. We'll see how things turn out."" About Time, which stars and , is only Curtis's third film as a director. Prior to Love Actually, he confessed, he did not have the confidence to take charge of the cameras. ""Many of the comedies I like the most, from Woody Allen's films to Monty Python's films, have been directed by the people who write them,"" he said. ""So it was quite a logical thing, but I wasn't ready to do it at that point. And when I reached that point, I was ready to do it."" Curtis did not discuss whether he would stop writing after the release of , which centres on a young man (Gleeson) who discovers he can travel through time and uses his gift to change history and woo McAdams's character. It is due out on 8 August in the UK, 1 November in the US and does not yet have an official Australian release date."
394	395	Domhnall Gleeson: 'Handsome is not really where I'm at' 	"n a fiercely sunny afternoon in London, Domhnall Gleeson lopes into the hotel courtyard in a blue hoodie and grey jeans, and sticks out a hand to shake mine. The cheerful 29-year-old pulls up a chair in the shade; he is pink and tall and skinny, with a shock of short orange hair in place of the lank locks worn in some of his most widely seen work. (He was Ron Weasley's scarred brother Bill in the final Harry Potter instalments, and a whimpering outlaw in the .) He is well known for his well-known father, Brendan Gleeson, who makes such a feast of supporting parts that you wish he got more leads. The same can be said of Domhnall (ignore the 'm' and rhyme it with 'tonal'). Though not, perhaps, for much longer. The haircut is for a new movie – Richard Curtis's latest rom-com, About Time, in which , a time-travelling lawyer, opposite Rachel McAdams. Curtis films tend to do miraculous things for an actor's profile: think of Hugh Grant, Rhys Ifans, Bill Nighy. Does Gleeson feel any trepidation about this? ""Yeah, yeah,"" he says decisively. ""I'll just grow my hair long when the film opens. I'll cope. I mean, I'm not built like a leading man. Richard's taking a bit of a risk casting this face in that role. Conventionally handsome is not really where I'm at."" The Irish writer-director Tom Hall, who cast Gleeson in as a rural lad turned ponytailed pimp, agrees with the actor's assessment of himself. ""Domhnall has a very mutable quality,"" he explains. ""He can look really beautiful on screen one minute and really alarming the next. It makes him very versatile. He gets offered lots of cowards, creeps and sex pests, but he's also an appealing and unconventional romantic lead."" Gleeson will shortly be seen in two new and dissimilar adaptations: the science-fiction thriller (""It's kinda great and pretty full-on,"" he enthuses), based on the 2000AD comic strip, and Joe Wright's lush adaptation of . In the former, he is a computer whizz whose eyes have been replaced by cameras; in the latter he plays the impassioned nobleman (and Tolstoy surrogate) Levin from behind a copper-wire beard. This month, he also appears in as Connor, an IRA soldier whose sister (Andrea Riseborough) turns informant. With his furtive eyes and ghostly pallor, Connor has been shaped and calcified by vengeance, and Gleeson uses the few scenes he has to make him achingly real. ""Portraying as human the people you hear about on the news doing bad things is dangerous,"" he reflects. ""But it's also necessary and important. And even more important is that the movie is entertaining, which I believe it is. Anything else it's trying to do is bollocks if it's just a statement. I don't want to watch a statement."" With the exception of Sensation, and the Live Aid drama When Harvey Met Bob, in which he plays Bob Geldof, Gleeson's career has been restricted to detailed miniatures. ""I'd rather do one day on a really cool movie than six months on something crap,"" he explains. ""I'm not going to get better as an actor working on bad stuff."" When he wants a particular job, he says he goes ""hell for leather"". One audition tape shot on camcorder in a cottage in Ireland won him the part in True Grit; another attracted compliments from , who is high on his wish-list of directors to work with. So too is Terrence Malick. ""Rachel McAdams just did a film with him so I've been annoying her on set by going, 'Now what would Terrence do in this situation?' and pestering her for stories."" Gleeson's short, spotless CV looks especially impressive for someone who doubted he wanted to be an actor at all. His father ditched a teaching job at the age of 34 to pursue acting but Gleeson, the oldest of four boys, has no recollection of tough times in his Dublin childhood. ""You might know you didn't have the coolest trainers but you don't realise it was hard for your parents to get Christmas together some years."" As a teenager, he gravitated toward writing and directing, determined he didn't want to be defined by his parents: ""No one does."" He refers to his father admiringly and often, but he'll bristle if someone tries to use that relationship as a stepping stone. ""I get asked to give stuff to my dad,"" he splutters. ""I'm, like, 'I'm not gonna pass your script to him!' You know? My dad's my dad. I'm not his agent.'"" At 16, Gleeson collected an award on behalf of his father; he delivered an acceptance speech full of chutzpah and promptly found himself with an agent. By 19, he was raising the roof in the West End in Martin McDonagh's raucous IRA-themed comedy The Lieutenant of Inishmore. Four years later, he went with the play to Broadway, where he was nominated for a Tony award. But the memories of agonising stretches of unemployment stayed with him. ""As an actor, there's very little you can do if people don't want to see you. Just getting yourself into the room to audition is tough."" His father had told him that when you're not getting work, you have to make your own. The upshot of this is that Gleeson is now a filmmaker himself, with two shorts, both festival hits, to his name. is a clammy comedy about romantic idealism and anal sex. ""I thought it'd be funny,"" he laughs. ""But it's a bit embarrassing when your Dad puts it on in front of your uncles on Christmas Day."" For the follow-up, , he cast his brother Brian, also an actor, and his father as dimwit policemen who turn an open-and-shut suicide into a tableau of Jacobean carnage. Both shorts are characterised by a wistful comic despair; they bode well for the full-length feature he has been writing for the past two years. It might have been finished by now if the acting career hadn't taken off. Following a few months at the start of 2011 that brought the release of True Grit, Sensation and the film of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go, in which Gleeson played one of a community of clones, he could scarcely leave his home without having an award thrust into his hands. He was named a at the Berlin Film Festival, and a Rising Star by the Irish Film & Television Academy. ( : ""I'm not so sure about 'rising star'. I could never get him up in the morning."") IFTA also made him Best Actor for When Harvey Met Bob, though Peaches Geldof provided a lone voice of dissent. ""She hated it,"" laughs Gleeson. ""Which is completely cool. She said I had a leprechaun's accent. I'm bloody Irish! But no, I respect that. I mean, he's her Dad."" Those who know Gleeson are confident in his future. ""I've kept in touch with Domhnall since Never Let Me Go,"" says , ""and I've become really struck not just by his huge and subtle talent, but by his modesty, and the decent way he instinctively treats everyone around him. It's unusual to find a young actor on the brink of stardom so useless at self-absorption. Instead, I get the impression he's always watching and thinking about everything going on around him, with a real understanding of people, and this should serve him well not just as an actor but with his directing and writing ambitions."" ""Domhnall is probably in two minds about the higher profile he's going to have soon,"" says Hall. ""Lots of young actors in that situation could easily have their heads turned, but his instincts have been unerring."" For now, Gleeson is having fun with the anonymity he enjoys. (Except in Ireland, where his larky work on the profane TV sketch show has made him the sort of star who gets his own punchlines quoted back at him by students.) He tells me he has lost count of the number of strangers who have approached him on location during About Time to ask whether there is anyone famous in the film. ""I usually say, 'Nah. They've got some crap guy off the telly, but apart from that …'"" Shadow Dancer opens 24 August, Dredd and Anna Karenina on 7 September. About Time is released next March. This article was amended on 17 August 2012 to correct the spelling of Brendan Gleeson in the standfirst."
400	401	Suzie Mackenzie meets Kate Winslet 	" remember an afternoon, in the early autumn of 1999, sitting in a bar on the Grand Canal in Venice. Opposite, the harmonious symmetry of the magnificent Basilica della Salute was almost enough to blot out the lopsided chaos created by coffin-loads of American tourists as their gondoliers punted them by. It was one of those near-perfect days, and I was just thinking, this is Venice - sublime and ridiculous both - when on to the outside terrace walked with her husband of one year, Jim Threapleton. (Winslet was attending the Venice Film Festival to promote her new film, Holy Smoke, written and directed by the Campion sisters and co-starring Harvey Keitel.) They sat at a table reserved for them at the back of the terrace, from where they could observe without being observed - a kind of organised privacy. And they looked, as all young lovers look, completely self-absorbed; maybe she talked more than him and, maybe, he seemed self-conscious, even shy. At one point, she dropped something and, as they both bent down to retrieve it, their heads banged together and they burst out laughing, though it must have hurt. Framed through the window where I was sitting, they looked like a picture postcard, both of them fair and with that shine of indestructible youthfulness. They looked, in other words, as though they imagined it would never end. Of course, it did, two years later, almost to the day, when Winslet's spokesman announced their separation: ""Their daughter Mia will remain first priority for both of them."" A bland counterpoint to Winslet's declaration when she first met Threapleton on the set of Hideous Kinky: ""When you know it's the right thing, you know . . . "" It was this memory that came to mind as I watched Winslet's latest film, the curious and fascinating Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind - an intelligent analysis of the nature of love posing as a romantic comedy. Its central theme is forgetfulness - whether, in pain, after the end of love, it is preferable to choose amnesia over experience. Winslet plays Clementine - kooky, insecure enough to be still dyeing her hair blue at 30, someone who skids along on the surface of life. Jim Carrey, a mighty and blessed clown, is Joel, the beleaguered simpleton who wises up. When he discovers that, after their break-up, Clem has had him clinically erased from her mind, he determines to do the same, only to discover, mid-process, that it can't be done. His mind resists it, or maybe it's his heart. In a series of beautifully welded flashbacks, we pursue Joel's thoughts into his past, back to his germinal impulse, his love for Clem. Charlie Kaufman, who writes, and Michel Gondry, who directs, take the idea as close as they dare to sentimentality - the film employs all the tired old vocabulary of romance. It knows what we choose to remember - a night spent gazing up at the stars together. But it also knows that there are deeper memories that we don't choose to remember, memories that threaten to explode those illusions we employ to survive. In one unforgettable, ravaging moment, Joel accuses Clem of sleeping with people just to make them like her. She protests, ""I don't do that."" Can we survive the impact of reality on illusion, the film asks. And its resounding answer is, well, we can try. Kate Winslet is not beautiful, but she has an enchantingly radiant face that tempts you to say that she is. She is smartly dressed, in one of those pinstriped trouser suits that can be thrown on without thinking - and that, I imagine, she will throw off the minute the interview is over - with tangerine-, or should that be clementine-, coloured shoes. She enters the room a bit fast, with an air of no-nonsense. ""It's hot in here. Let's turn on the air-conditioning."" Which she does, immediately followed by, ""Normally, I'm no good at things like that."" Her accent, oddly, is northern. She rolls a cigarette, simultaneously apologising. ""I allow myself two a day."" The accent is now gone. She talks excessively fast, in gulps, as if she would rather be somewhere else, as indeed she would. At one point, a baby is heard crying in a nearby hotel room and she becomes visibly distressed. ""Is that Joe? Can someone find out if that's Joe?"" Joe, her son by her second husband, the theatre and film director Sam Mendes, is just three months old and she is still breast-feeding. She is voluminous on the subject of being a mother for the second time at the age of 28. ""I think of myself as a mum who finds the time to go to work. I have to check myself for baby sick before I walk out of the house in the morning. I am really a mum ... I know I am a great mother."" She defends herself against imagined criticism. ""I was reading to Mia the other night and I thought, 'I need to tell her I am going to work and might have to leave the house before she gets up'. I said, 'Babe, you know mummy's got to work tomorrow.' And she said, 'Don't be silly, mummy, you don't work, you take me to school.' "" Before suddenly checking herself: ""I hate the fact that I'm sitting here forced to justify who I am as a parent, what I do. How my child is happy. How it's all fine now. It's ridiculous."" And it is - not because she's anxious about her young children, but because no one is forcing her to do this, the impulse is all her own. It is as though she is constantly anticipating ambush. I think the point at which I liked her most was when she suddenly said, apropos of nothing, ""I am insecure. If you ask me, everybody is."" In the past, she says, ""I had a tendency to speak before I thought."" She has never hidden the fact that, during her divorce, she nearly went under, that she was hurt and confused by what she calls ""the flak"". Until then, she had always thought that she was liked. ""I thought I was good at dealing with the press."" She presented an image of success, youth. Glamour, yes, but unaffected: her wedding reception was held in a pub, they drank beer. Hers, the tabloids proclaimed, was a ""perfect marriage"". And she colluded with that - right up until the point when it came crashing down. Recently, she admitted to an American magazine that she had lied about the caesarean birth of her daughter, saying publicly that it was a natural birth. Then, when her audience turned treacherous, resented the illusion being shattered, she was amazed. ""The things that were said. That I was a bad mother, that my daughter didn't live with me. How she was with her father all the time. All these things . . . they really did nearly kill me."" Of course, she coped. She always has coped. Of her experience of being bullied as a fat girl at school, she says, ""I think it made me stronger."" And her treatment by the papers must have felt like bullying. Then she met Mendes, and she found herself not worrying so much about how she was seen. ""We knew that they would say we had been having an affair. We weren't stupid. Though, of course, it wasn't true."" In a recent television appearance in the US, she cried because she was so happy. When I ask her now what she means by love, she replies, ""Love to me, God, this is so difficult . . . To me, love is when you meet that person and you think, 'This is it, this is who I'm supposed to be with.' "" She says this for all the world as if she has never said it before. And you have to wonder if there isn't some lack of self-awareness here, something that leads her to keep offering up this perfect version of events. But I don't think this concerns her. What matters is that the happy image is intact again. She has found a part. This idea of what we choose to remember and what we choose to forget is central to Kaufman's film, and to Winslet's role in it, but she won't talk about forgetfulness, or at least not in any meaningful way. When I ask about the role of Clementine, and whether it was cathartic to play her, she retreats behind a veil of rosy-sounding cliché. ""You don't leave people behind."" The question everyone is asking her now, she says, is, ""Would you erase anything?"" ""And the answer is, No. I really wouldn't. The good and bad things are what form us as people . . . change makes us grow. To have one foot in the past, to hang on to the what-ifs, to say if I hadn't done that or he hadn't said this . . . all these things are pointless. I really believe in, move on, live and let live, forgive and forget."" So it is there, forgetfulness, after all. If in person Winslet can seem insecure, it is this seeming weakness that is her great strength as an actor. More than anything, she is a chronicler of our own social insecurities and self-doubt. All her characters are in search of that elusive goal, happiness. All are characters in search of a part. From the outside, the trajectory of her career looks smooth, even easy. She won her first film part, in Heavenly Creatures (1994), at the age of 17, against 175 other actors who auditioned. Prior to this, she had done ""bits"" in soaps while working part-time in a delicatessen.""I couldn't believe I was in a film and it was such tremendous fun."" It is an interesting film to look at in terms of her career, because she played it before she was fully formed as an actor. Based on a true story, it is the tale of two adolescent girls, Pauline and Julia (Winslet plays Julia), out of touch with reality, who form a cloistered, imaginary world of their own. (That conflict between illusion and reality again.) When the outside world intrudes - the parents try to separate the girls - they plot and then murder Pauline's mother, crushing her to death with rocks. It's a compelling story, it was well received and it brought Winslet to notice. But, looking back now, she is not, in fact, particularly good in it. If a definition of acting is to embody a role, Winslet's technique here is to attack her part with a hysteria bordering on the monstrous. Julia is brittle, but there is one extraordinary moment, as the murder begins, when the camera falls on Winslet and we see her suddenly step back from the brink, the consequences of her actions written in the confusion on her face. This is what Ang Lee must have wanted when he cast her in her next role, as Marianne Dashwood in Sense And Sensibility. A great director, he found a way to harness her precarious hysteria, while keeping the confusion. In this film, she is not simply a blundering idealist: her frailty endangers her and everyone around her. There is an argument that she played the part too well, that she made the undercurrent too dark. (She went on to play two tragic figures, Sue Bridehead in Michael Winterbottom's Jude, and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.) But Lee's film kept its glossy sheen, the dialogue sparkled, there was a balance between surface and depth. In 1995, for this part, Winslet became the youngest female actor to be nominated for an Academy award (she was 19). ""It was the changing point, really. It made me realise that people like what I do. It gave me confidence. I think any form of self-expression is half confidence, half sheer hard work and, maybe, a bit of talent thrown in."" She is not being disingenuous here. She means it. ""It is really hard work."" If something looks easy from the outside, most likely it is not. She was brought up in a family of actors. Her father is an actor, both her older and younger sisters, Anna and Beth, act. Her grandparents on her mother's side founded the Reading Repertory Theatre. She has consistently and often spoken affectionately of her background, as she does now. ""We all get on. We're the kind of family that gets together for Sunday lunch. I see my younger sister all the time."" It is clear there wasn't much money when she was young, and just as clear that her father was not successful - he had few parts. But this isn't the point. ""I come from a family of hard-working actors who relish it when they do go to work and take part-time jobs in between."" Acting, as she knows, is a harsh world, and frequently one in which talent is not employed as it should be. Her father never gave up acting. He carried on, looking for parts. ""That is what you do as an actor. You struggle. So that's the life I imagined I would lead."" This is the reality of acting, and it is something she has known since she was a child. She didn't think it would necessarily produce a sense of security. But then, as she says, ""Insecurity is what actors work with all the time."" The success of Titanic made her a star, and in one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Its director James Cameron knew it would make her a star, and he gave her a star's entrance - that moment when she walks down the stairs to greet Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack. She looked as stars are supposed to look - her own woman and, of course, a man's woman. Julia Roberts couldn't have done it better. Anna Campion, who wrote Holy Smoke and worked with her shortly after Titanic remembers how ambivalent Winslet was about her success. ""I think to her it was a shock, then a pleasure, then a drag. But she could handle the attention. Kate is good at that. She understands that she is a movie star now."" Following Titanic and a second Oscar nomination, Winslet was offered handfuls of studio leads, all of which she turned down. (Reportedly, she declined Gwyneth Paltrow's role in Shakespeare In Love, though she tells me it would be ""unsisterly"" to confirm or deny this.) Most people were surprised when she chose a small film, an adaptation of Esther Freud's Hideous Kinky (1998), to follow her blockbuster. ""The point was I could choose. That was the luxury Titanic afforded me. There was tremendous pressure on me to do something 'big', but I ducked it all. I had to. If I hadn't, I would have burned out by the age of 25. So I ran a mile - back to where I felt safe again."" She has had the same British agent since she was 15. ""The same American agent from 18."" She has never had a manager or a ""business attorney"". Hideous Kinky was not a great part, but it took Winslet out of period drama and into the modern day. Her character, Julia, is naive, irresponsible, a lost soul moving around Morocco with two small children in search of herself. She is a kind of precursor to Kaufman's Clementine, but without any of Clem's endearing edginess. Winslet says that she liked Julia's ""itinerant quality"". ""I think I wanted to be Julia, travelling, no worries."" (In fact, she has misremembered the part - Julia is perpetually riddled with anxiety.) Anyway, she can't have wanted to be Julia that much, because it was on the set of Hideous Kinky that she met Threapleton. They married a year later. The Campion sisters' Holy Smoke (1999) was Winslet's last good part before the fallout from her marriage break-up in September 2001. In a way, the role is another reprise of the lost soul in search of meaning. She plays Ruth, a cult member in India, kidnapped by her family and brought back to Australia to be ""de-programmed"" by the spivvy Harvey Keitel character. The film turns into a battle of wills, which Ruth wins. In the end she has all the power, and it frightens her so much that she runs away. (Much as Winslet herself had done after the success of Titanic.) It was the first time, Winslet says, that she consciously set out to play an unlikable character. ""Jane Campion taught me that."" Campion asked her, ""Do you need to be liked?"" ""And I said, 'Yes, but I don't really care. I don't care if I'm criticised.' She said, 'Do you want an audience to like you?' I said, 'I think I do. I like to make nice people.' 'Well, forget it,' Campion said. Ruth's not a nice person. You'll have to get over wanting to be liked."" Winslet says: ""I will always be grateful to her for that."" There are bound to be echoes of autobiography in any actor's work. Maybe that is why it is so hard to like Enigma, a bland, code-breaking drama, or the execrable The Life Of David Gale, films into which Winslet put very little of herself. Iris (2001), based on John Bayley's memoirs of his wife, the novelist Iris Murdoch, she says, wakened her up. ""I think I had been dormant in myself for some time. Mia was just six months old, I could afford four weeks on Iris and it was a gift, really."" The gift, she says, was to play someone removed from her own world - and at a time when her own world was beginning to dissolve. ""She was someone completely unlike me and unlike my life. I don't mean I used it as a place to hide. I know some actors do - they put their personal pain into their work. I try not to do that."" She came to like Iris. ""I liked the fact that she didn't judge others. And she didn't judge herself. At least not beyond the limits of what she knew she was capable of."" This is a realist speaking: you carry on, you do what you can. Which is, you could say, the moral of Titanic. In that film, the illusion and everything that was built on it, including Jack and Rose's romance, founders, it gets sucked into the depths. Only Rose, clinging resolutely to the surface, survives. But maybe it doesn't have to be this way. There is a wonderful scene at the end of Eternal Sunshine where Joel confronts Clementine. He wants to start again, she is not so sure. Clem, who can't bear confrontation, who can't bear failure, who'd rather simply forget, is surprised. She, for all her surface eccentricity, is far more conservative than he. It will happen again, she tells him. I'll get bored with you and I'll leave you again. That's who I am. That's OK, he reassures her. It really is OK. And why not? Go back into the illusion, this time knowing it is an illusion? It may not be perfect. But really it is OK "
416	417	Robin Williams remembered: 'A remarkable performer, a brutal shock' 	 was a superb, mercurial standup comic with a staggering talent for improv and verbal riffing, though his movie career finally evolved into an intriguing split – sugary sentimentality or an ambiguous, menacing darkness. Something similar happened with Steve Martin and Jerry Lewis. The “Mr Hyde” in Robin Williams’s movie persona was well known. So the news of his death, and the indication he has taken his own life, is deeply shocking. He clearly suffered from depression – these were symptoms hiding in plain sight – and his brilliance assumes a deeply sad aspect. Williams could suspend his merciless, crazy irony almost entirely for glutinous family movies like Patch Adams, in which he played a doctor who treated sick kids using his irrepressible sense of humour, or the solemn fantasies like Bicentennial Man, or even his second world war drama Jakob the Liar. Or he could be chilling and sinister, as he was in One Hour Photo, a disturbing drama from 2002 in which he played the drugstore photo lab employee (in the days before digital cameras) who becomes obsessed with the pictures he develops showing a suburban family. Then there was his performance , in 2009, in which he plays another creepy yet tragic character, a high-school teacher whose son dies in a grisly accident, and who then concocts a bogus suicide note and rides a wave of celebrity and sympathy. Williams had a big-hearted side, a love of broad and a muscular, intensely physical talent for it, which he showed off in his smash-hit drag act Mrs Doubtfire from 1993. He played a divorced guy who disguises himself as a housekeeper with a bizarre Scottish accent, employed by his unsuspecting ex-wife, so that he can keep an eye on the children. It was a role that showed off Williams’s talents – the zaniness, the dressing up, the bizarrely transparent absurdity, combined with his big-hearted, faintly lachrymose vulnerability and sentimental concern for children. For me, his best movie was Good Morning Vietnam from 1987. It was hardly the first time I had seen him – that of course was in his legendary 70s TV comedy Mork and Mindy, which introduced Britain and the world to his madcap clowning. But Barry Levinson’s film was perhaps the nearest a feature film came to representing his standup style and his subversion. He was Adrian Cronauer, the anarchic, motormouth DJ on Armed Forces Radio who lets rip at the microphone, disses the pompous world of the military, and rips everything to hilarious shreds. The soldiers love him; the top brass are deeply irritated and it’s clear that an awful collision is approaching, especially as Cronauer himself is beginning to let the horror of war get him down. Williams improvised a lot of his speeches himself; only he could have given that full-throttle intensity. What a remarkable performer. This is a brutal shock.
421	422	Robin Williams' career in clips: from Mork to Mrs Doubtfire via Aladdin 	, a quiet kid who hid his shyness behind wicked impersonations, studied at the Juilliard school in New York alongside Christopher Reeve, before jumping to primetime fame as a loveable alien in the TV series, Mork and Mindy: “Na-nu na-nu!” The character of Mork actually started life in another hit show, Happy Days – Williams impressed creator Garry Marshall by standing on his head in auditions. This silly streak went on to define his career. Williams made his film debut in the forgettable 1977 sex comedy , but it was as a Russian circus performer in 1984’s Moscow on the Hudson that he picked up his first Golden Globe nomination. It wouldn’t be his last. The innate comedic ability that impressed Marshall was showcased to louder effect in 1987’s glorious Good Morning, Vietnam, in which Williams played an irreverent US military radio DJ shipped out to 1965 Saigon – beloved of the troops but not his superiors. The actor improvised most of his speeches – “What a country. Heat, humidity, terrorism. Still it’s better than New York in the summertime” – this time he bagged the Golden Globe. Peter Weir’s Dead Poets Society (1989) saw Williams play to a more sensitive side as an idealistic English teacher in an elite boys boarding school: “Strive to find your own voice because the longer you wait to begin the less likely you are to find it at all.” Both Weir and Williams were nominated for Oscars and . “Robin Williams as Mr Keating was my inspiration to study English and act,” . Williams next squared up to Dustin Hoffman’s Hook in Steven Spielberg’s 1992 big budget remake of Peter Pan, with Peter now a corporate lawyer who must reclaim his inner child to get his own kids back from the baddie. Production was protracted and reviews none too positive. Spielberg has since said: “I’m hoping someday I’ll see it again and perhaps like some of it.” But for Williams, it was the first of many family blockbusters. One of Hook’s problems was having to compete with another Williams film of the same year. Aladdin was part of the early 90s Disney renaissance – directors John Musker and Ron Clements wrote the part of the Genie specifically for Williams, persuading him to take it by making a compilation of his standup recordings against clips from Aladdin’s animation. Williams “laughed his ass off” and signed up. Many a fan’s favourite, Mrs Doubtfire was a huge box office hit in 1993, though its only Oscar win was for best make-up. Deservedly so: the family flick sees Williams dress (and bust) up as an out of work San Francisco voice actor who masquerades as a matronly Scottish nanny to see more of his children. Mrs Doubtfire became the second highest grossing film of the year, only losing out to Jurassic Park. Williams went on to lead an impressive ensemble cast for Mike Nichols’ 1995 remake of the 70s French classic, La Cage aux Folles in which he played the Miami drag club owner Armand Goldman. Steve Martin had pulled out of the role and Williams had originally been earmarked to play Armand’s more exuberant partner, Albert, but after Mrs Doubtfire, he decided to leave the cross-dressing to Nathan Lane this time. More family fluff followed in Jumanji (1995) and Flubber (1997). But, despite the commercial hits, it wasn’t until 1998 that Williams picked up his first Oscar for his part in Gus Van Sant’s indie drama, Good Will Hunting. Williams was back in inspiring teacher mode as Dr Sean Maguire, a psychologist at a community college who gives Matt Damon’s brainy but tough-kid janitor a reason to aim higher. Academy catnip. Williams did small and creepy too. The unsettling 2002 movie One Hour Photo saw him at his most terrifying: a technician of a one-hour photo lab who becomes obsessed with a young family. Tagline: “There’s nothing more dangerous than a familiar face.” Williams, the erstwhile family favourite, showed a new one here. Despite his well documented , Williams continued to work, with several duds to his name, though his turn in 2009’s was labelled a glorious return to form. had his fans excited, but his last decade was dominated by his turns as Theodore Roosevelt in the Night at the Museum franchise – the third instalment is among four films he leaves in the can after his death. , Williams’ career was ultimately defined by an intriguing split – “sugary sentimentality or an ambiguous, menacing darkness”. He could do sensitive, he could do sinister, and between those two, he could also be joyously, masterfully silly.
426	427	Top 23 character actors in film 	"52 We Need To Talk About Kevin, Michael Clayton, The Beach There are times you feel as if Swinton has made it her mission to eradicate all traces of natural provenance. She's achieved an almost clone-like physical presence: an ageless, androgynous, translucent-skinned human blank, ready to be moulded into whatever role she's assigned. And boy does she get through them. She's been everything from a distressed housewife to the Angel Gabriel; corporate lawyer to Narnian ice queen. But in personality terms, she's the complete opposite of a blank. Malleable though she may be, Swinton has ironically become her own trademark. Whatever she's playing, she brings with her a distinguished legacy of cultural adventurism: aristocratic bohemian, RSC drop-out, punk heroine, artist's muse, fashion pin-up. Her looks alone usually guarantee she's the strangest and most memorable character in the movie, but if the camera loves Swinton, she never looks like she really cares. She'd rather show you what's going on beneath that flawless surface. Even when she stoops to mainstream Hollywood cameos, her performances are minutely detailed, so that you want to look closer to see how she's doing whatever it is she's doing. As once said of her: ""She doesn't announce her presence, she just slowly steals all the gravity."" The Woman Who Fell To Earth 38 Revolutionary Road, Take Shelter There's something not quite right about him. That's invariably the first impression with Shannon's characters, from his visiting neighbour in Revolutionary Road, to his NYPD officer in Premium Rush, and best friend Donnie in Machine Gun Preacher. Is he a violent psychopath trying to look normal or a regular guy who you're just reading wrong? He's an expert at confusing the signals: an overlong stare, a slight edge of hostility to an otherwise innocuous line, the subtle implication that he could just violently FREAK OUT at any moment. His action-hero physique only adds to the effect (his General Zod in the new Superman movie is a mouthwatering prospect). As Pink Floyd would say, Shannon, you crazy diamond. Jesus Christ 43 Knocked Up, The Hangover ""I'm That Guy From That Thing,"" reads , and while he certainly is that guy from those things, the regular is hardly the type of actor you can't place. With his crazed eyes and rageball explosions, he's quickly become the go-to guy for banshee outbursts. Thirty years ago, he would have been put under contract in the Police Academy films, although to say so does him a disservice, as he's very funny: the sequence in which he sprung naked from the car boot in The Hangover and beat seven shades out of everybody was a masterclass in physical comedy. Expect something similarly loud when the third instalment of the franchise appears this summer. Aggressive humanoid alien emperor 37 The Descendants, Jeff Who Lives at Home (and Arrested Development) She's undoubtedly a lovely lady in real life, but with that shrill, reedy voice, cold eyes and those terrifyingly sharp cheekbones, the awesome Judy Greer has one of the nastiest faces in Hollywood. Consequently, she does an unparalleled line in bitchy best frenemies or casually insane office workers with deep-seated stomach churning psychosexual problems. She consistently steals scenes in , the caustic TV spy cartoon where she plays Cheryl Tunt, the glue-sniffing, loves-to-be-choked, sadistic secretary with a relish not seen (probably) since Marlon Brando first discovered butter. Plus, as the herpes-ridden PA Kitty Sanchez in the much-loved , she flashes her boobs an inordinate amount; and we love her for it. Greer would rip a ""no-holds-barred-on-the-crazy"" biopic of Joan Crawford a new one. 49 Kick-Ass, Sherlock Holmes Someone out there must be murdering all the intense, middle-aged, follically challenged, evilly inclined actors because there only seems to be one left. Strong is the arch-arch-villain. He specialises in well-tailored, managerial baddies who look as if they could crack your skull with their bare hands if it really came down to it; which it usually does, in a green-screen action climax.

432	433	EU and US sanctions against Russia: which will they hurt more? 	"The latest round of EU sanctions against Russia is designed ""to hurt Russia more than it hurts us"", according to the foreign secretary Philip Hammond. With trade between Europe and Russia worth 10 times more than US trade with Russia, leaders are treading a fine line between sanctions that will influence Moscow while not damaging their own economies – many of which are still emerging from the eurozone crisis. The latest sanctions are more sweeping than previous ones, and target whole sections of the Russian economy – not just individuals and companies. On Thursday the EU will publish full details of the sanctions, which include: A ban on Russian state-owned banks' access to western capital markets An arms embargo and ban on the sale of any ""dual-use"" technology destined for use by the Russian military Restrictions on the export of hi-tech oil-production machinery, with a total ban on equipment destined for deep water, Arctic or shale production. Washington has also blocked three Russian state-owned banks from US capital markets, as part of a package of measures Barack Obama said would impose growing costs on . But Hammond also acknowledged: ""It would be absurd to suggest that we can impose wide-ranging sanctions on the Russian economy without also having some impact on ourselves."" Both sides will be watching closely to see which is hurting the most. Below are the industries targeted and the pain factor for each side on a scale of 1-5, with 5 the most painful. Denying Russian banks access to the moneylenders of New York, London and other western financial capitals could eventually tip the country's struggling economy into full-blown recession. The EU has banned banks and companies registered on its territory from buying or selling bonds issued by Russia's state-owned banks or their subsidiaries. The US has put Russia's second-largest bank, VTB, the Russian Agricultural Bank and the Bank of Moscow on its banned list. But Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, has not been included, raising fears that loopholes and exclusions may weaken the impact of the sanctions. US banks have been less generous funders of Russia in the past: European banks had lent Russian institutions around $155bn (£92bn) at the end of March, according to the most recent figures available from the Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements. Excluding Russian state banks from international finance would not trigger instant collapse, but the measures are certain to increase capital flight, increase pressure on the rouble and put any investment plans into the deep freeze. So far, the Russian Central Bank has vowed to stand by its banks and take ""necessary, adequate measures"" to protect depositors and customers. The City of London is often seen as the main loser from any attempt to freeze Russia out of the financial system but only 1% of its earnings come from Russia. Austria's Raiffeisen Bank, which has a large retail banking operation in Russia, is more exposed, with France's Société Générale in second place. The big western energy firms are heavily involved in Russia, which produces 10.5m barrels of oil a day and is the world's third-largest producer. BP, which has a 20% stake in Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, has already warned it could see . Even while the conflict in east Ukraine was raging, BP and Rosneft struck a deal to exploit potential shale reserves in the Urals in May. A company spokesman said he could not comment on how the EU's export ban would affect this deal until BP had seen the full EU sanctions list. ExxonMobil, Statoil and Shell, which also hope to profit from Russia's hydrocarbon riches, are likely to be caught out by sanctions. But the biggest cost is likely to fall on Russia, which is in desperate need of western cash and know-how to modernise its antiquated refineries and leaky pipelines. In 2012, the EU exported £150m in specialist energy technology to Russia, a tiny part of overall exports, suggesting the measure will hurt far less. The EU sanctions deliberately excluded the gas industry, in a tacit acknowledgement of Europe's dependency on Russian gas. Poland gets more than 80% of its gas from Russia, while the Baltic states and Finland are 100% dependent. But Hungary, which is 80% dependent on Russian gas, could come under increased pressure following a deal it signed with Russia in February to build two nuclear reactors. The ban on dual-use goods, those that have civilian and military applications, could have the biggest impact on Germany, Europe's export powerhouse and the largest EU exporter to Russia. Not only does Germany export machine tools, cars and chemicals to Russia, around 6,000 German companies have a presence in the country. The Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations in Germany estimates that the country's exports to Russia and Ukraine are on course to shrink by €6bn (£4.8bn) in 2014 and claims 25,000 people will lose their jobs if affected firms do not find alternative export markets. But in recent days the lobby group has softened its rhetoric to recognise ""the primacy of politics"". While certain companies are heavily exposed, German exports to Russia account for barely 1% of its economic output, while only a small subset of its chemicals industry is expected to fall foul of the dual-use category under the sanctions, according to Capital Economics. Countries will be banned from signing new contracts to sell arms to Russia, although France's controversial €1.2bn (£950m) deal to sell Mistral assault ships to Russia will go ahead. A future ban could have a far reaching impact on a number of countries, especially the UK and France. As recently as mid-July, . The ban on the EU-Russian arms trade will hit Russia harder than the EU. While Russian arms exports to the EU were worth €3.2bn (£2.5bn) in 2012, the EU's trade was €300m (£237m). The European commission has said only a fraction of the €20m (£15m) dual-use technologies that the EU exports to Russia would fall foul of the ban on military exports."
437	438	BP's risky Rosneft relationship: 'We work in countries with ups and downs' 	"In a week when BP's involvement in Russia once again raised concern among investors, the City can draw consolation from the fact that chief executive is a veteran of the country's perilous politics. In 2008 Dudley was the boss of the oil and gas group's profitable joint venture, TNK-BP: an uneasy alliance with four Russian oligarchs. as he warned of an ""orchestrated campaign of harassment"" amid expectations he could be seized on trumped-up visa charges. This time, Dudley faces questions over the BP's near-20% stake in Rosneft, the Kremlin-controlled oil group that has been dragged into the latest round of EU sanctions through restrictions on the export to of hi-tech equipment for extracting fossil fuels. The shareholding in Russia's largest oil group is a legacy of BP's exit from TNK-BP, when BP sold its shareholding in the joint venture to Rosneft. Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at the New York-based Oppenheimer brokerage, says that Russia has been one of the best investments ever made by . But the investment community is always wary of the place. ""The fact is that BP has always been willing to take calculated risks whether its going into Russia, through its extensive trading activities or running its balance sheet at a high level. It works for them. It's a spicy food. Some like it hot."" Dudley, who was raised in Mississippi but experienced many ice cold Moscow winters, is clearly one of them. In the wake of his Moscow flight, Dudley not only stayed with BP outside Russia but ended up winning the top job inside the company. He replaced Tony Hayward following the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico of 2010, then went on to mastermind an astonishing rapprochement with Russia through the TNK-BP share deal with Rosneft. If that move – consummated last year – looked then like a brave personal and corporate move for Dudley and BP then it looks today like an dangerous gamble, some would argue. On top of the sanctions threat, this week Europe's most senior arbitration court ruled that a significant amount of the assets held by Rosneft had fallen into its hands following an illegal expropriation of holdings belonging to another privately-owned oil group in Russia, Yukos. A group of investors, who have been awarded $50bn (£30bn) worth of damages by the court in the Hague court, has already warned it may come looking for BP to secure payment. On Thursday the European court of human rights ordered that a further €1.9bn (£1.5bn) in compensation should be paid to former shareholders in Yukos. But Russia has always held a great allure for BP. The group's first half financial results this week gave a glimpse why, with a profit share and dividend payment from Rosneft worth over £1.3bn. And Dudley remains convinced that his move to sell up the stake in TNK-BP and accept some of the proceeds through a stake in Rosneft was the right thing to do. ""We absolutely stand by strategically what we have done. We are very, very long-term investors. We work in countries that have ups and downs."" But at the same time the company spelled out the risks facing it. ""If further international sanctions are imposed on Rosneft or new sanctions are imposed on Russia or other Russian individuals or entities, this could have a materially adverse impact on our relationship with and investment in Rosneft, our business and strategic objectives in Russia and our financial position and results of operations,"" it said in a statement. BP is not alone in its interest in Russia with ExxonMobil, Total and many other of the western oil ""majors"" holding joint ventures or other important ties with either Rosneft, or another local players. Russia after all holds the largest gas reserves in the world and the third largest producer of oil after Saudi Arabia and the US. Shell has a major commitment to the country, not least through its liquefied natural gas (LNG) scheme at Sakhalin in eastern Russia but other companies have recently signed deals to explore for shale in Siberia and search for hydrocarbons in the Arctic. Shell has had its own difficult experience in Russia when it faced a series of claims by the environmental watchdog that it had broken a variety of regulations at Sakhalin. These claims stopped after it gave in to pressure from Gazprom to sell off part of its stake leaving many Western commentators to conclude the Anglo-Dutch group was being harassed for political reasons, something the Kremlin denied. BP was encouraged to sell its stake in TNK-BP for an initial $12.5bn in cash plus an 18.5% stake – now raised to 20% – when its private sector partners succumbed to its own pressure from Rosneft. BP pointed out that it bought its original half share in TNK for $8bn and took $19bn in dividends over the years. But there were those who wondered whether the tie-up with Rosneft was a good idea and whether it would have been done if BP had more options. The company was still reeling from the impact of the Macondo blowout and the billions of dollars that it had been forced to pay out for clean up and compensation. North America is still its single most important region – as well as a key investor base – and yet BP had seriously damaged its reputation with the fire at the Texas City refinery, a nasty pipeline fracture in Alaska and then the Deepwater Horizon accident which created the worst environmental disaster. While many companies such as Shell have moved into the Arctic as a new frontier for oil and gas, BP pulled out of Greenland amid speculation that its involvement would be inflammatory in the eyes of Greenpeace and others. Instead the group, whose share price yet to fully recover from Deepwater accident, has concentrated its fire power on places such as Azerbaijan, Angola and Iraq as well as rebuilding operations in the Gulf of Mexico where it remains the biggest single operator. BP shares are still trading on a near 20% discount to the rest of the sector but City analysts said project delivery and the threat of sanctions against Moscow remain key risks. Neil Morton, at Investec Securities, noted drily after the cheerfully good first half figures that ""reading BP's quarterly results is arguably a more useful exercise for law students than for financial investors. Russia has now been added to the litany of (mostly Macondo) legal risks."""
468	469	‘Freedom of expression’ anti-snooping campaign launched over Ripa changes 	An urgent campaign has been launched in the UK for a “freedom of expression” law to protect confidential journalists’, MPs’ and lawyers’ phone and communications records being secretly snooped on by police. Senior editors and lawyers condemned as “wholly inadequate” safeguards put forward in a code of practice by the home secretary, Theresa May, to meet concerns over the police use of surveillance powers linked to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa). Critics of May’s safeguards fear that the police will still have sweeping powers allowing them to authorise themselves to access the phone and email records of professionals such as journalists, lawyers, doctors, MPs and priests who handle privileged, confidential information. More than 3,000 national and regional editors are being asked to sign a joint letter from the Society of Editors and Press Gazette, the industry’s journal, condemning the Home Office joint code for failing to recognise “the overarching importance of protecting journalists’ sources”. The campaign comes as the prime minister, with a plan to ban in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo Paris attacks. Bob Satchwell of the Society of Editors said: “It is vitally important that everyone in the media makes it clear how important this issue has become. Journalism isn’t a crime and should not be treated as such.” May had offered to provide guidance over existing police powers after it emerged the Met police secretly to find people who had leaked him information in the Plebgate affair. But Dominic Ponsford of Press Gazette warned: “The government’s draft Ripa code is a licence for the state to spy on journalists’ phone records at will. It allows police forces to approve their own requests for journalists’ call records provided they make a note of their target’s profession. It means that police forces will be able to continue to track down and punish lawful journalistic sources (as was the case with the Met Police and the Sun’s Plebgate sources). The guidance makes no mention of the overriding public interest in protecting journalists’ sources.” Alistair MacDonald, QC, chairman of the Bar Council, said that the Charlie Hebdo attack should not allow such spying powers to go through unchallenged: “The Paris murders, by extremist gunmen who were known to the security and police services, have already attracted considerable support for an extension of surveillance powers,” said MacDonald.  “That surveillance can save lives seems undeniable.  However, it is one of the objectives of extremists who are willing to commit barbaric crimes in support of purportedly religious or political ends, that the hard-won liberties of the civil population should be curtailed and that a wedge should be driven between those in society with different views about the degree to which personal freedoms should be sacrificed on the altar of public safety,” he said. Despite the emerging objections, Home Office ministers look set to back changes next week that would let police carry on secretly snooping on confidential professional phone and web records at will. They appear to be set to reinforce on Monday “not to allow any means of communications which it simply isn’t possible [for the authorities] to read.” That indicated that the Conservatives wanted to be able to break into encrypted communications. The senior journalists and lawyers say that at the very least an independent judge should have to consider the case to protect the identity of their sources before police can access journalists’, lawyers and other professionals’ phone records. The journalists concern is the unfettered use of Ripa powers will mean that public sector whistleblowers and other key sources will not come forward if the law enforcement agencies have the power to view journalists’ phone records at will. They argue the practice amounts to state interference with press freedom. Press Gazette has since established police forces conducted more than 400 official investigations into leaks to the media. The campaign has some political support from elsewhere in the coalition. On Monday, deputy prime minister, , cited the use of the Ripa surveillance laws to obtain journalists’ records as an example of measures introduced in the name of “public safety” that actually “undermine the very freedoms we cherish”. But the Home Office consultation on proposed changes to the Ripa code of practice which closes next Tuesday has suggested doing little more than requiring the authorising officer to give “additional consideration” to the level of intrusion in cases involving professionally confidential or privileged information and record each time an application is made. If pushed, ministers have suggested they might also require the police to flag all applications to the interception of communications commissioner, who oversees the use of the surveillance powers. MacDonald, said: “As a caring society, we cannot simply leave surveillance issues to senior officers of the police and the security services acting purportedly under mere codes of practice.  What is surely needed more than ever before is a rigorous statutory framework under which surveillance is authorised and conducted.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “A free press is fundamental to a free society and the government is determined that nothing is done that puts that at risk. Communications data is an absolutely critical tool used by police and other agencies to investigate crime, safeguard national security and protect the public. There are measures in place to ensure that police powers to access this data are not abused. We recently published a strengthened code of practice meaning that extra consideration should now be given to a communications data request involving those in sensitive professions, such as journalists. The revised code is currently undergoing public consultation.”
469	470	Nick Clegg queries whether police acted lawfully over David Miranda 	"A coalition rift over the treatment of David Miranda has been exposed after about whether police acted lawfully in ""forcibly detaining"" the partner of a Guardian journalist. In a direct challenge to Theresa May, the home secretary, who has endorsed the action by the Metropolitan police, the deputy prime minister said police needed to act proportionately as he indicated that the Liberal Democrats would press for restrictions to anti-terror laws. In his first detailed response since the nine-hour detention of Miranda at Heathrow on Sunday, Clegg, , confirmed that he was not consulted in advance about the police action and said he will wait to see whether the anti-terror legislation watchdog rules on whether the police action was ""legitimate"". The remarks will raise new questions about whether the Met acted lawfully in detaining the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. This says that police can only detain an individual at ports and airports to assess whether they have ""been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism"". Clegg contrasted the police action with the way in which the government negotiated with the Guardian to destroy hard drives containing NSA documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Clegg wrote: ""I was not consulted on the plans to detain David Miranda before it happened and I acknowledge the many concerns raised about the use of Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for these purposes. ""There is obviously a material difference between agreeing by mutual consent that files will be destroyed, and forcibly detaining someone. ""Terrorism powers should be used proportionately. That is why it is immensely important that the independent reviewer of terrorism powers, David Anderson QC, reports rapidly on whether this was a legitimate use of the Terrorism Act, and whether that legislation should be adjusted."" Anderson, who is to question Home Office officials who briefed May on the plan to detain Miranda during his short inquiry, called this week for changes to the Terrorism Act. May has ruled out any further changes beyond those proposed before the detention of Miranda. Clegg wrote: ""This autumn we will be taking a bill through parliament to implement these changes [announced before the detention of Miranda]. In my view, if David Anderson provides a clearly justified recommendation to restrict these powers even further, we should seek to do so in this bill."" In his article Clegg confirmed that in its negotiations with the government the Guardian made its own decisions about whether to publish information from the leaked NSA documents which could damage national security. ""Along with the information the newspaper had published, they had information which put national security and lives at risk. It was right for us to want that information destroyed. They had decided not to publish this information: not a single sentence was censored from their newspaper as a result of the information being destroyed."" Clegg used his article to dismiss a claim by William Hague, in the wake of the first revelations in June from the leaked NSA documents, that law-abiding citizens have ""nothing to fear"" about monitoring by intelligence agencies. The deputy prime minister wrote: ""Liberal Democrats believe government must tread the fine line between liberty and security very carefully, and are not easily persuaded by a government minister asserting: 'Just trust me.'"" He was also scathing about Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, who had raised questions about the detention of Miranda. He wrote: ""People are right to ask questions about the detention of David Miranda for nine hours this week. But Yvette Cooper voted for powers to detain suspects for 90 days – 2,160 hours. Her outrage is almost comic."""
472	473	BAE closure of Portsmouth shipyard prompts political row 	"The coalition has been accused of sacrificing Portsmouth's 500-year-old shipbuilding tradition to save the industry in before Scotland's independence referendum, as it unveiled plans for almost 1,800 job losses in the two cities. , the Conservative defence secretary, said it was ""regrettable but inevitable"" that BAE Systems' Portsmouth site would have to close, as there would no longer be enough orders to sustain two major military shipyards in the UK. The closure in removes the immediate threat of closure from Glasgow's Scotstoun and Govan yards, although 835 jobs will be lost at those sites as well as at two other locations, in Fife and Bristol. These will be kept open to build three patrol boats while they wait to begin construction on millions of pounds' worth of type 26 warships in 2015. However, ministers faced claims that they were playing politics with UK jobs as Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish secretary, said it would be difficult to award the type 26 work to if the country voted to leave the UK in 2014. BAE will cut 1,775 jobs in total once its construction of two multibillion-pound aircraft carriers is completed. While Glasgow's two major yards have been protected, shipbuilding will end for good in Portsmouth, with the loss of 940 jobs, bringing the curtain down on a centuries-old industry in the city that built the Tudor warship the Mary Rose. In the House of Commons on Wednesday the defence secretary tried to put a positive spin on the announcement, saying £100m would be spent on upgrading and repairing the naval base at Portsmouth. The city will soon be home to the HMS Queen Elizabeth, HMS Prince of Wales and type 45 destroyers. The government said the decision to close Portsmouth had been taken by the company alone ""on the basis of industrial logic"" as – the UK's largest defence contractor – said Glasgow was the best location for building the type 26. The move was largely backed by Labour, although the party said it needed to ""take time to fully examine the consequences"". However, several MPs in the south claimed the government was behind the decision, arguing that Portsmouth had suffered from a political calculation that jobs could more easily afford to be lost in the south than in Glasgow, whose voters are crucial to the outcome of the Scottish referendum next year. Mike Hancock, the independent MP for Portsmouth South, said his constituents had paid a ""very heavy price for a slightly cynical manoeuvre"", while John Denham, the Labour MP for Southampton Itchen, said southern England has been ""sold downriver while the government looks elsewhere"". Some Tories questioned whether there had been a tradeoff, with Caroline Dinenage, the MP for Gosport, saying she thought Portsmouth jobs had been sacrificed. ""The fact that Scottish jobs have been protected at the expense of those on the south coast, which is an area of equal economic need, for us is devastating and very upsetting,"" she said. While the decision to save the Glasgow shipyard could help the campaign for Scotland to stay part of the UK, the closure of Portsmouth's site also does not bode well for the electoral prospects of Penny Mordaunt, MP for Portsmouth North, who has a majority of just over 7,000. Mordaunt, a Royal Navy reservist and aide to the defence secretary, has written to BAE Systems to ask why some of the patrol vessels cannot be built in Portsmouth when the city asked for two ships to be built there. Pressed on the issue of English versus Scottish jobs, Hammond said the losses were a ""harsh blow"" but the decision had been made in the national interest. He stressed that the redundancies in Portsmouth should be seen in light of the 11,000 remaining jobs in the city's ship maintenance industry. It is understood that Vince Cable, the business secretary, has worked with Hammond to provide a support package to Portsmouth and the surrounding area, with aides promising more to come. Vernon Coaker, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said he wanted to know what bearing the independence poll had had on the decision and what would happen to the industry if Scottish votes to leave the UK. Asked about the issue, David Cameron's official spokesman said: ""This is a government that always takes decisions based on the national interest. This decision was taken with a view of how we have the best-equipped, best-maintained Royal Navy."" The prime minister himself said it had been an ""extremely difficult decision"" for BAE to close the Portsmouth shipyard, but promised there would still be a lot of work in the city maintaining ships for ""many, many years to come"". As he explained the closures and job losses, Hammond was also quizzed on the costs of the aircraft carrier programme as he confirmed that the bill had risen by a further £800m to £6.2bn. He said the increase had not come as a surprise and he could not guarantee that the bill would not rise further. Turning his fire on the opposition, Hammond blamed the previous government for placing an order for the aircraft carriers without a final design. The first of the carriers, Queen Elizabeth, is due to begin sea trials towards the end of the decade. A decision will not be taken until 2015 about whether the second carrier, Prince of Wales, will ever be operational; it could be sold or mothballed. The carriers were built by a consortium that included BAE."

485	486	Serco chief quits before investigation into electronic tagging charges 	"The boss of government outsourcing group quit to allow a new boss to be appointed from outside the troubled company. Serco is scrambling to restore its reputation following a series of debacles ranging from failing to provide enough doctors in Cornwall to charging the government for electronic tags on dead prisoners. Chris Hyman, left with immediate effect on Friday after 20 years with the operator of hospitals, prisons and railways. He said he would ""step back"" from his chief executive role, held for 11 years, to allow relations with the government to be rebuilt. He received £2.5m last year, when bonuses are included, and he is expected to walk away with £1.6m and a £2m pension pot. He has options over shares, that if he were to cash in today would be worth an additional £2m. A government spokesman welcomed his resignation – discussed with the Cabinet Office in advance and announced just weeks before the government is expected to decide whether to allow Serco to bid for future contracts . Serco generates a quarter of its revenues from government work and is attempting to placate the government after claims it had overcharged the Ministry of Justice by ""tens of millions"" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. Last month after charging the government for tagging criminals who were either dead, still in prison or who had never been tagged in the first place. The government said it would take ""full account of all the changes Serco have made"". ""Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward,"" the government said. But Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the home affairs committee, said: ""I am surprised by the resignation of Mr Hyman who has always maintained that there is nothing untoward with the contracts that Serco holds with the government, even after the company was referred by secretary of state for justice to the SFO."" Shares in Serco, which was demoted from the FTSE 100 last month after its shares fell sharply following the allegations over its tagging contracts, rose 1p to 557p after the surprise departure of Hyman. Hyman said: ""At this time, nothing is more important to me than rebuilding the relationship with our UK government customer. In recent weeks it has become clear to me that the best way for the company to move forward is for me to step back."" Underlining the scale of the task involved in repairing relations with the government, Alastair Lyons, the Serco chairman, said a new chief executive would be appointed from outside the group. In the interim, Ed Casey, head of the Americas division since 2005, will take the helm. The management upheaval came less than 24 hours after rival G4S, also caught up in the controversial electronic tagging fiasco, . The G4S chief executive, Nick Buckles, left in May. Both companies are being subjected to a government-wide review of every one of their contracts and have been ordered to prove they are taking steps to improve their operations. Serco, which was transformed into a major international firm under Hyman, is embarking on what it describes as a ""renewal programme"". The UK and Europe division is to be split in two, with one section to focus on the ""UK government customers"" and the other on activities in the wider public sector. Three new non-executive directors are to be appointed along with a new general counsel. A board committee for corporate responsibility is also to be created. Despite Hyman's rapid departure, Lyons paid tribute to the outgoing boss: ""As CEO since 2002, he has taken Serco from a predominantly UK business with a turnover of £1.3bn to the £5bn international services business it is today. He leaves with our very best wishes."" Brought up in apartheid Durban, Hyman is a Pentecostal Christian and was one of only a few non-white students at his university. He the Guardian that he donates a biblical tithe – or 10% of his annual income – to his local Pentecostal church in Surrey and fasts every Tuesday, as he has done every week of his life. He worked for Arthur Anderson and Ernst & Young before joining Serco in 1994. Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, said Hyman may have become a scapegoat. ""Typically, CEOs at companies that face a scandal are often pushed out to clear the air. This tends to lead to some short-term confusion, but pays off in terms of an increase in corporate performance. But in some cases it can be a fatal distraction where companies feel they have addressed the big issues by changing the leader."""
489	490	London 2012: G4S boss Nick Buckles admits to Olympics 'shambles' 	"The chief executive, Nick Buckles, has told MPs that he regrets ever signing the Olympic security contract that has turned into ""a humiliating shambles"" that has left his company's reputation in tatters. But Buckles made clear that he is not going to fall on his sword and resign his £830,000-a-year job before the Games are over and astonished MPs by insisting that G4S is not going to waive its £57m ""management fee"" despite accepting 100% responsibilty for the security debacle. The G4S chief executive clearly dismayed MPs on the Commons home affairs committee by saying he still couldn't guarantee that all the 7,000 security guards the company is contracted to supply will turn up on the opening day of the Games. He disclosed that a further 500 troops could be called up if the 3,500 put on standby last week don't prove enough. The G4S boss confirmed that his company will pay all the extra costs faced by the military and the police for replacing private security guards when they fail to be supplied, including accommodation. He also made clear that the company will now also consider paying £500 bonuses to armed forces personnel whose leave has been cancelled to cover for the Games. The two-hour grilling by MPs left the boss of the largest private security company in the world looking bruised and broken. The committee chairman, Keith Vaz, told him that the impression of his company created by his performance was ""unacceptable, incompetent and amateurish"". Tory MPs told him he left them with no confidence that G4S will actually fulfil the contract and said the public were ""sick of huge corporations like yours thinking they can get away with everything"". Buckles admitted that the company clearly regretted signing the contract which had been regarded as a vanity project with little financial profit in it ""We did it to boost our reputation,"" he said, adding that the £10m it stood to make would not have contributed much to their global profits. Now they faced a loss of up to £50m and had already led to a decision to drop their plans to bid for the security contracts for the 2014 football World Cup and the 2016 Olympic games in Brazil. The company's share price has plunged 15% in the past three days. The paper trail disclosed to the committee showed Home Office ministers and senior officials, including the director of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, Charles Farr, had been kept in the loop since early April with daily meetings from 3 July until the troops were called in on 11 July. But Buckles made no attempt to point the finger at the home secretary, Theresa May, or her security minister, James Brokenshire, and instead said he took ""100% responsibility"" for the debacle. May and Farr have been called to give evidence to the MPs' inquiry but will not attend until 6 September after the are over. Buckles said he had flown back from America on 3 July when he was phoned on holiday and told that there were serious problems in providing the necessary security guards. His evidence and letters submitted to the committee show that there was a period of eight days when Home Office officials and ministers were clearly in the loop. But the home secretary was careful in her Commons statement last week not to say that she did not know but that the problem did not ""crystallise"" until last Wednesday when the decision to call in the troops was made. The G4S bosses said they currently had 5,500 guards they could ""schedule"" for security duties – who had been trained and accredited – and they were being joined by a further 500 a day. They hoped to have 7,000 in place by the opening day of the Olympics and are hoping to give the police and military three to four days' notice of where they are needed to make up the numbers. But Buckles admitted that they were able to give less than 24 hours' notice about a shortfall for a cycling event at Box Hill in Surrey on Tuesday, when the company was only able to supply 17 of the 38 staff they were contracted to provide. Vaz told Buckles that he was astonished that he was still in post, but the G4S chief replied: ""It's not about me; it's about delivering the contract. I'm the right person to ensure that happens."""
494	495	UK gathering secret intelligence via covert NSA operation 	"The UK's electronic eavesdropping and security agency, , has been secretly gathering intelligence from the world's biggest internet companies through a covertly run operation set up by America's top spy agency, documents obtained by the Guardian reveal. The documents show that GCHQ, based in Cheltenham, has had access to the system since at least June 2010, and generated 197 intelligence reports from it last year. The US-run programme, called , would appear to allow GCHQ to circumvent the formal legal process required to seek personal material such as emails, photos and videos from an internet company based outside the UK. The use of Prism raises ethical and legal issues about such direct access to potentially millions of internet users, as well as questions about which British ministers knew of the programme. In a statement to the Guardian, GCHQ, insisted it ""takes its obligations under the law very seriously"". The details of GCHQ's use of Prism are set out in documents prepared for senior analysts working at America's National Security Agency, the biggest eavesdropping organisation in the world. Dated April this year, the papers describe the remarkable scope of a previously undisclosed ""snooping"" operation which gave the and the FBI easy access to the systems of nine of the world's biggest internet companies. The group includes Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo and Skype. The documents, which appear in the form of a 41-page PowerPoint presentation, suggest the firms co-operated with the Prism programme. Technology companies denied knowledge of Prism, with Google insisting it ""does not have a back door for the government to access private user data"". But the companies acknowledged that they complied with legal orders. The existence of Prism, though, is not in doubt. Thanks to changes to US surveillance law introduced under President George W Bush and renewed under Barack Obama in December 2012, Prism was established in December 2007 to provide in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information about foreigners overseas. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US. The documents make clear the NSA has been able to obtain unilaterally both stored communications as well as real-time collection of raw data for the last six years, without the knowledge of users, who would assume their correspondence was private. The NSA describes Prism as ""one of the most valuable, unique and productive accesses"" of intelligence, and boasts the service has been made available to spy organisations from other countries, including GCHQ. It says the British agency generated 197 intelligence reports from Prism in the year to May 2012 – marking a 137% increase in the number of reports generated from the year before. Intelligence reports from GCHQ are normally passed to MI5 and MI6. The documents underline that ""special programmes for GCHQ exist for focused Prism processing"", suggesting the agency has been able to receive material from a bespoke part of the programme to suit British interests. Unless GCHQ has stopped using Prism, the agency has accessed information from the programme for at least three years. It is not mentioned in the latest report from the Interception of Communications Commissioner Office, which scrutinises the way the UK's three security agencies use the laws covering the interception and retention of data. Asked to comment on its use of Prism, GCHQ said it ""takes its obligations under the law very seriously. Our work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the interception and intelligence services commissioners and the intelligence and security committee"". The agency refused to be drawn on how long it had been using Prism, how many intelligence reports it had gleaned from it, or which ministers knew it was being used. A GCHQ spokesperson added: ""We do not comment on intelligence matters."" The existence and use of Prism reflects concern within the intelligence community about access it has to material held by internet service providers. Many of the web giants are based in the US and are beyond the jurisdiction of British laws. Very often, the UK agencies have to go through a formal legal process to request information from service providers. Because the UK has a mutual legal assistance treaty with America, GCHQ can make an application through the US department of justice, which will make the approach on its behalf. Though the process is used extensively – almost 3,000 requests were made to Google alone last year – it is time consuming. Prism would appear to give GCHQ a chance to bypass the procedure. In its statement about Prism, Google said it ""cares deeply about the security of our users' data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data"". Several senior tech executives insisted they had no knowledge of Prism or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a programme. ""If they are doing this, they are doing it without our knowledge,"" one said. An Apple spokesman said it had ""never heard"" of Prism. In a statement confirming the existence of Prism, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence in the US, said: ""Information collected under this programme is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats."" A senior US administration official said: ""The programme is subject to oversight by the foreign intelligence surveillance court, the executive branch, and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-US persons outside the US are targeted, and that minimise the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about US persons."""
509	510	Some Ukip candidates could be BNP members, says leader Nigel Farage 	"Some of Ukip's candidates in next month's local elections could be BNP members or have criminal records, party leader has said. Farage said candidates that he would ""rather not have had"" could be standing in the elections because lacked the means to fully vet them. His comments came after it emerged that a candidate had been thrown out of the party when it was discovered that she used to be a member. Susan Bowen, a retired sheep farmer from Boscastle in north Cornwall, had been selected to stand in the Tintagel ward on 2 May. She was once a BNP activist and spoke at a far-right meeting in 2010, footage from which is on YouTube. Farage told the BBC's World at One programme that the party had to rely on candidates being honest about any criminal convictions and other issues. He said there may be ""one or two"" council candidates that Ukip would not be happy with, but said it was not possible for the party to vet all 1,700 in time. ""When it comes to the general election and the European elections, we have put in place a very rigorous testing procedure – testing people's knowledge, their ability with media – you know, full credit checks, police checks and all the rest of it,"" said Farage. ""I'll be honest with you, we don't have the party apparatus in a very short space of time to fully vet 1,700 people. ""We have made people sign declaration forms, expressing the fact that they've never been part of political parties that we consider to be wholly undesirable. ""By that I mean the BNP. And, you know, we ask people if there is a problem with a criminal record or whatever else it may be, please tell us. ""I have no doubt that among those 1,700 one or two people will have slipped through the net that we'd rather not have had."" Political analysts have predicted that – with the Tories as the main victims. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said on Wednesday that around 16% of Tory supporters at the last election say they would now vote Ukip. This compares with 8% for the Liberal Democrats and 4% for Labour. A Ukip spokesman said: ""We've got the honesty to admit we're not perfect. We don't have absolutely 20:20 vision on all our candidates. We ask people questions. ""We like to take people's words on it. However, sometimes we get burnt. But when we do get burnt we act."""
518	519	Ed Miliband challenges David Cameron on pay rise and party funding 	"Ed Miliband hopes to force on to the back foot on Thursday by making it clear that a planned £6,500 pay rise for MPs is unacceptable, and vowing that every Labour candidate will go into the next election promising, if elected, not to have any outside directorship or consultancy. He also challenged the prime minister to agree on a £5,000 cap on individual, business and union donations to political parties. The MPs' watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), is expected to propose a £6,500 increase in MPs' current £66,396 salary from 2015 – around 10%. But Ipsa will try to soothe the inevitable public anger by promising that the increase will not cost taxpayers anything because, at the same time, it is ending MPs' £33,000 severance payments, cutting the cost of MPs' pensions and reducing allowances such as the £15-a-head meal subsidy after 7.15pm. Cameron, aware of the seething private anger among his backbenchers over their frozen pay, has declined to tell his MPs not to take the increase, instead focusing on the need to ensure the package is cost-neutral. Ipsa will put its recommendations out for consultation on Thursday, and it is likely there will be another review after the election. Ipsa has reminded MPs it is entirely independent of parliament and they no longer have any statutory influence over their pay. After a difficult fortnight due to the fallout of the Falkirk vote-rigging scandal, Miliband is determined to show he is sorting out the union funding of his party, although Cameron is not willing to reopen the recently abandoned all-party talks on funding reform. Miliband needs to show his party and the unions that, whatever the merits of his reforms to the party-union relationship, they will pay political dividends and so are worth the likely internal strife. At the noisiest prime minister's questions for many years, Miliband noted that hedge funds had donated £25m to the Tories and that the chancellor, George Osborne, granted hedge funds a £145m tax cut in the budget. The leader said: ""This is a man owned by a few millionaires at the top of society and everyone knows it. Here's the difference between him and me … I want party funding reform; he doesn't. I am proud that we have links with ordinary working people. He's bankrolled by a few millionaires – the party of the people, the party of privilege."" Cameron rejected the £5,000 cap on donations on the grounds that taxpayers would have to make up the difference in funding. ""I don't see why the result of a trade union scandal should be every taxpayer in the country paying for Labour,"" Cameron said. Tory sources pointed out that the 2011 Kelly review on party funding had suggested that a £10,000 cap on union and individual donations would have meant Tory income falling on average by 76% annually between 2001 and 2010, while Labour would have lost 91% of its income. State funding would be the only way to replace the loss, the Tories said. Cameron also declined to say whether he supported Miliband's proposed ban on MPs' second jobs, instead citing the example of former cabinet ministers Jack Straw and David Blunkett, who both have outside interests. The prime minister sought to put the pressure back on Miliband by saying he should help to amend a government bill next week to implement the Labour leader's plan to require individual trade unionists to opt into affiliating to the party. This was dismissed by Labour as a stunt because Miliband's proposal does not require legislation, but at most changes to party rules. Cameron said the Miliband reform plans, outlined in a speech on Tuesday, had not diminished the dominant role of trade union leaders in the Labour movement. But the GMB union said Miliband's proposal will have far-reaching consequences and could mean the loss of 90% of the party's annual income from the unions. The government will try to embarrass Labour next week by publishing a bill that will regulate third-party spending, including by unions, during election campaigns. It is claimed in the 2010 election 23 of these third-party campaigners, including the public service union Unison, spent £2.8m – £1m more than that reported in 2005 – and around 9% of the £31.5m spent by political parties on national campaigning."
522	523	Ed Miliband told to stop 'knee-jerk' union funding reforms 	" will jeopardise Labour's chances of winning the next election if he forces through ""knee-jerk"" party funding reforms before then, the leader of the UK's biggest public sector union has warned. Speaking on the eve of the Labour leader's speech to the TUC conference in Bournemouth, Unison general secretary accused Miliband of seeking to escalate a ""local issue"" in Falkirk into a rewriting of the party's link with unions; this decision was ""off the wall"", Prentis said, when Labour should be fighting for better jobs and wages. ""It is a side issue that is sucking the life out of the campaign, and it will lead us down a cul de sac,"" he said. ""It means we will not be elected, and it means we will face a Tory government next time that will be far, far more rightwing than the one we have now. The stakes are massive, and it is up to Ed to get a grip of the party and make sure they are campaigning to win the election."" Prentis's intervention will increase the pressure on Miliband, whose attempt to change the way unions fund the Labour party has met with widespread hostility among many union activists, who say it is detracting from the real issues. Len McCluskey, the leader of Unite, which was at the centre of the Falkirk row, said Miliband should be proud of Labour's links to unions. ""Instead of being embarrassed about the fact that trade unions are linked to the Labour party, they should embrace and welcome that, because we are the voice of real Britain – of genuine, decent working people,"" he told a fringe meeting at the congress. Tensions between Labour and the unions flared up after allegations of malpractice in the selection of a candidate in Falkirk. Unite was cleared of any wrongdoing, but the row reached crisis point last week when the GMB union slashed its funding to the party from £1.2m to £150,000 in reaction to Miliband's plans for an ""opt-in"" principle in union affiliation. Labour has set up an inquiry into the union link. That will report back at a special conference in the spring. On Monday, however, Prentis said he may not attend, adding that Unison would not change the way it worked ""one iota"", irrespective of what the inquiry recommended. ""We are not going to reopen this sterile debate within our union because [of] Ed Miliband's knee-jerk reaction to what happened in Falkirk,"" he said. He blamed a small ""political elite"" within the Labour hierarchy for pushing Miliband into the reforms when it should be working with the unions to set out a vision on jobs, wages and housing that would give people hope. ""There are groups within Labour's political elite who seem to be stirring up issues when they should not be doing it, and that has come to a head with Ed Miliband making the speech in July,"" he said. ""It has stirred up a hornets' nest months before an election. It was totally unnecessary and is taking away from the real issues."" He said Miliband had ""thrown the baby out with the bathwater"", and that Labour was endangering its link to millions of decent working people when Westminster politics was viewed as distant and irrelevant by a growing section of the population. ""People will just turn away from [Labour] and think 'What are these prats playing at? … When I am working three part-time jobs just to get food on the table, or having to do zero-hours contracts, and these people … This is really all they are bothered about?"" The TUC leader, , also defended the role of the unions, telling activists that without the union movement there would never have been the NHS, the 1944 Education Act, equal pay for women or the minimum wage. ""And remember,"" she said, ""who first exposed the scandal of tax avoidance? Who first raised the alarm on living standards? And who first blew the whistle on zero hours? You can see why some people want to shut us up. That is why we must stand up for our rights – not just union rights, but civil rights."" She defended union funding of Labour, saying member donations were the ""cleanest cash in politics"". ""We are united in defending the basic democratic principle that ordinary people have the right to a political voice,"" she said. ""That union money – the few pence freely given every week by nurses, shop workers and truck drivers – is the cleanest cash in politics today."""
532	533	UK construction industry grows for fifth consecutive month 	"Britain's construction industry maintained its run of strong growth for the fifth month in September, according to the CIPS/Markit survey of purchasing managers in the sector. Markit said construction companies ended the third quarter of 2013 with ""a strong expansion of overall output levels and a further improvement in their new order books"". A slight dip in growth from a soaring month of expansion in August failed to dent confidence in industry boardrooms for the year ahead. The degree of positive sentiment was the highest since April 2010. Higher-than-expected order books also boosted employment numbers for the fourth consecutive month. Job creation reached its fastest for just under six years. Much of the growth came from private housebuilding, which has grown strongly over the last year in response to and is now rising at its fastest rate since 2003. The Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, which has cut mortgage rates, is also credited with increasing the supply of cheap credit. The headline Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) posted 58.9 in September, down from a near six-year high of 59.1 during August. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: ""Construction is no longer the weakest link in the UK economy. The third quarter of 2013 ended with output growth riding high amid greater spending on infrastructure projects and resurgent housebuilding activity. ""The reversal in fortunes has spanned commercial, residential and public sector construction projects. Moreover, builders are confident that a tide of new tender opportunities will continue to lift the construction sector in the months ahead, supported by improved development funding conditions and better underlying economic conditions. ""September's survey suggested that constructors are beginning to react with confidence to the more positive landscape for the sector, as job creation and input buying both rose at robust rates over the month."" Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the construction sector is exhibiting ""marked sustainable improvement following extended, deep weakness"". He said: ""Indeed, the construction sector highly likely saw even stronger expansion in the third quarter than in the second quarter when output grew 1.9% quarter-on-quarter. The construction PMI averaged 58.3 in the third, which was up substantially from 50.4 in the second quarter and was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2007. This fuels belief that GDP growth in the third quarter could very well have accelerated to close to 1%"" However, output across the construction industry remains well below its peak and analysts estimate that between 100,000 and 150,000 construction workers are either working in other sectors or out of work. Before the recovery in output that began in May, output by the construction sector was 22% below its 2008 level and private housebuilding was 38% below the previous high. According to ONS figures output by the industry is now around 14% below its peak."
535	536	The impact of being blacklisted for trade union memberships 	"Steve Acheson, who feared he had been on a blacklist, said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" by the findings of the information commissioner's investigation. The electrician, 55, from Denton, south Manchester, said: ""I've been angry for so long. It affects your character and demeanour - it's the fact it's so blatantly unjust. I'm hoping that because of this brilliant success I'll be able to get my family life back and it will open the doors for me and others to get back to work."" Acheson said the government should ban companies that use the blacklists from taking public sector contracts. He suspects that being blacklisted for his trade union membership is the reason why he has only had 36 weeks' employment in the last nine years. He believes he was blacklisted after winning three separate employment tribunals and felt he had been punished for those victories. ""Up to 2000 I'd be getting a couple of job offers a week from agencies. I was a supervisor on the Channel tunnel, I worked all over the Middle East. I should be securing £40,000 a year but I've not had an employment agency phone me in nine years."" Graham Bowker, from Oldham, has only worked for five months since winning an employment tribunal case along with Acheson in 2006. The electrician, who has been in the industry since 1971, believes he deserves compensation. He said: ""I've been at snapping point a few times. You've got a job, then you haven't got a job. You get to the stage where you think, should I bother? As soon as I've phoned and given my national insurance details, they don't call back. I'm going to ask my MP, Michael Meacher, to see if I can get my NI number changed."" Colin Trousdale, 50, from Bacup, Lancashire, has found work hard to come by since he spoke up for colleagues who were sacked two years ago. Trousdale, who has 35 years' experience as an electrician and is an active trade union member, believes he is on a blacklist. He said the information commissioner's action against Ian Kerr made him very happy. The pressure of not finding work contributed to the breakup of his marriage and forced him to move out of Manchester to find work, he said. ""I had to move away because employers would look at the postcode and think I was a troublemaker,"" he said."
537	538	Labour will lead Britain on race to the top, Ed Miliband vows 	"Labour will lead Britain in a ""race to the top"", in contrast to the Tories, who want a ""race to the bottom"" which would turn the country into a sweatshop, pledged on Tuesday. In a highly personal speech, in which he spoke of the values of decency instilled by his mother, Miliband opened a new chapter in his leadership of as he focused on optimistic ideas to ensure ""Britain can do better"". The Labour leader has been criticised for a lack of policy detail in his two most recent conference speeches, in which he first outlined plans to create a new form of responsible capitalism and then spoke of his plans to forge a One Nation Britain. But he answered his critics on Tuesday as he unveiled a series of substantial policy initiatives headed by a pledge to freeze energy prices for the first 18 months of a Labour government and an ambitious programme to build 200,000 houses a year by 2020. Speaking without notes for just over an hour and winning one of his most enthusiastic conference receptions, he set out his ideas within a new framework in which Labour will acknowledge that global forces are to blame for breaking the ""vital link"" between economic growth and rising wages. ""They used to say a rising tide lifts all boats, now the rising tide just seems to lift the yachts,"" he said. But in a direct challenge to George Osborne, who said earlier this month that complaining about the rising costs of living does not amount to an economic policy, Miliband said the Tories would compound the crisis as wage rises fall behind inflation. ""The cost of living crisis isn't an accident of David Cameron's economic policy, it is his economic policy. He believes in this thing called the global race, but what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks for Britain to win the global race you have to lose – lower wages, worse terms and conditions, fewer rights at work. ""Britain can't win a race for the fewest rights at work against the sweatshops of the world and the more we try the worse things will get for you."" Miliband reinforced his main message – that Labour would lead a race to the top and the Tories would lead a race to the bottom – by reeling off a series of areas where Labour would protect workers. He won some of the biggest cheers as he said: ""Employers not paying the minimum wage and government turning a blind eye – it's a race to the bottom; not under my government. Shady gangmasters exploiting people in industries from construction to food processing – it's a race to the bottom; not under my government. Rogue landlords, putting 15 people in tied housing – it's a race to the bottom; not under my government."" Miliband showed he believes Osborne made a grave political error in his recent speech – the chancellor said the return of economic growth showed Labour had comprehensively lost the argument on the economy – when he mocked the Tories' attempts to claim credit. Pointing out that Osborne is presiding over the slowest recovery in a century, he said: ""Next week we are going to see David Cameron resuming his lap of honour for how brilliantly he's done as prime minister. Claiming credit for his enormous achievements, how he has saved the economy as they put it. No doubt he'll even be taking off his shirt and flinging it into the crowd expecting adoration from the British people like he did recently on holiday."" The Labour leader reinforced his economic attack on the Tories with a strong assault on the character of Cameron, who had put the interests of Rupert Murdoch over the interests of the parents of the missing girl Madeleine McCann. In what is likely to be seen as his strongest attack on the PM, he said: ""If you want to know the difference between me and David Cameron, here's an easy way to remember it. When it was Murdoch versus the McCanns, he took the side of Murdoch. When it was the tobacco lobby versus the cancer charities, he took the side of the tobacco lobby … he may be strong at standing up to the weak but he is always weak when it comes to standing up against the strong."" Miliband, who still faces criticism for destroying the political career of his older brother, David, when he stood against him for the Labour leadership in 2010, said he was best placed to move the party on from the Blair-Brown era. ""Leadership is about risks and difficult decisions,"" he said. ""It is about those lonely moments when you have to peer deep into your soul. I ran for the leadership of this party – it was really hard for my family, but I believed Labour needed to turn the page and I was the best person to do it."" He spoke of how his mother, the activist Marion Kozak, had taught him decency by teaching him to listen to people and never to be contemptuous of the views of others. ""Some people will say but you have to leave decency behind when it comes to politics. Well I say they are wrong, because only if you reach out and listen can you do the most important thing a leader can do, the most important qualification in my view for being prime minister."""
544	545	Top thinktank revises UK output up as consumers start spending again 	"The return of consumers to the shops has prompted one of Britain's economic thinktanks to revise up its growth forecasts for the period up to the general election. Amid signs that households are becoming more willing to spend, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said it expected national output to rise by 1.2% in 2013 and 1.8% in 2014 – an increase of 0.3% for both years. However, NIESR said there was still a case for the government taking steps to boost investment. Friday's report follows an upbeat survey of manufacturing from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply and Markit, which showed business conditions for industry at their most buoyant in more than two years. In the City, the stock market moved higher after better-than-anticipated news from the US manufacturing sector pushed shares on Wall Street to a record high. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee adopted a wait-and-see approach – leaving official interest rates at 0.5% and its asset purchases under the quantitative easing programme at £375bn. Next week, Threadneedle Street will provide guidance to the financial markets on the length of time it plans to leave monetary policy ultra-loose, with the City confident that the current regime will last at least until 2015. NIESR said: ""We have revised up our GDP forecasts by 0.3 percentage points in both 2013 and 2014, to 1.2% and 1.8% per annum, respectively. The main cause of the improvement in the economic growth outlook is a rise in the prospects for consumer spending growth. This increased contribution from consumer spending is at the expense of household saving, rather than a consequence of rising real disposable incomes."" Even so, NIESR added, there would still be substantial spare capacity in the economy as a result of the UK's slow recovery from its deepest postwar recession. ""In such an environment, an acceleration in demand growth should be possible without stimulating inflationary pressures … policy measures to boost investment, both public and private, would benefit the economy in the short and long term."" A second group of forecasters, Fathom Consulting, also said it anticipated growth of 1.2% this year – double the chancellor's forecast in the budget – rising to 2% in 2014. ""That would represent by far the strongest performance since the crisis began. But far from reflecting a rebalanced economy, we detect a return to the bad habits of old. We expect growth to be driven by increased consumption on the back of rising household debt, as both investment and net trade remain weak. Rebalancing has been abandoned in pursuit of 'growth at any cost',"" said Fathom. The monthly survey of industry from CIPS/Markit showed a sharp increase in orders and production and continued the upward trend into a fifth month. After suffering badly during the recession and the UK's sluggish recovery, the Purchasing Managers' Index – a barometer of manufacturing's strength – rose from 52.9 in June to 54.6 in July, with any reading above 50 indicating an expanding sector. Companies reported stronger demand both at home and abroad, with firms selling consumer goods experiencing the strongest trading conditions. Manufacturers ran down their stocks to meet demand and expanded their workforces for the third month. Industry reported that inflationary pressure remained weak. New export orders increased at their fastest pace in two years, reflecting higher sales to China, Australia, Kenya, Nigeria, Mexico, Russia and the US. There was also an improvement in exports to the eurozone, where the manufacturing PMI moved above 50 for the first time in two years last month, from 48.8 in June to 50.3 in July, and raised hopes that the single currency area will return to growth in the second half of 2013 following an 18-month recession. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply, said: ""The much-vaunted 'march of the makers' has finally materialised with the UK manufacturing sector's output growth hitting a 29-month high in July. Exports have been critical to this success, but it is the broad-based nature of the sector's performance which endorses the view [that] we are on track for solid and accelerated growth in the coming months."""
549	550	Matalan fails to contribute to Rana Plaza trust fund as deadline looms 	"Matalan is the only major British retailer not to have donated money to the UN-backed fund to compensation the victims of the factory collapse. The budget high street retailer has made no contribution to Rana Plaza trust fund ahead of the official fundraising deadline on Thursday, according to the campaign group 38 Degrees. Other British retailers linked to the factory, including Primark, Asda, Debenhams and N Brown, have paid money into the fund to support the families of the 1,129 people who died and the 2,515 who were injured in the 2013 disaster. Matalan was asked to donate £3m to the fund, which is backed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), a UN agency. The company, which is run by Jason Hargreaves, the son of the chain's billionaire founder John, said it was ""fully committed to its role as a responsible lender"" and had chosen to fund a different scheme. It declined to say how much it had donated to the Rana Plaza Survivors Rehabilitation Scheme, which is managed by Bangladeshi development organisation BRAC. ""We believe that if every one of the retailers that had garments produced in Rana Plaza gave just a small proportion of the money that they made as a result to helping the survivors and their families, then well over $40m could be raised,"" a spokesman said. Matalan said it had committed to giving 100% of the money it made from its clothes made in Rana Plaza to the BRAC fund, but given that it received only an ""initial pilot shipment"" of clothes from the factory, it was unlikely to have made very much money from garments produced there. ""We have visited the area several times to see the work that BRAC is doing on the ground in , including providing essential medical care and helping people build a self-sufficient future, providing counselling where it is needed, enhancing basic life skills and supporting those who do not wish to return to work in the factories by helping them find new jobs."" BRAC's schemes are not seen, however, to provide full compensation for loss of earnings by injured workers and the families of those who died. Matalan said it was also supporting the Bangladesh fire and building safety accord, the body set up in the wake of the disaster to ensure higher factory standards through a legally binding agreement, but it did not say how much money it had provided. The organisation said last week that retailers needed to stump up another £4m. The ILO fund had raised $17.7m (£10.4m) by 4 July, according to , far short of the $40m target. David Babbs, the executive director of 38 Degrees, said: ""Matalan says it's a family-friendly business, yet it still hasn't paid up the money it owes to the children of people who died in the same factory that made its clothes. ""Matalan may have made peppercorn donations to other charities, but that's no substitute for the proper compensation it owes to the survivors of the Rana Plaza disaster. ""If Matalan wants to carry on selling its clothes to Britain's mums and dads, it needs to convince them that its family-friendly image is more than clever PR spin. Paying the money it owes to the families of the Rana Plaza disaster would be a good place to start."" Sam Maher of the workers' rights group Labour Behind the Label said: ""The families of the Rana Plaza victims have been waiting for 15 months for the compensation they deserve. ""They are now so close to getting justice. The only barrier remaining is the refusal of brands like Matalan to pay what they owe. ""We urge Matalan to immediately pay the £3m so urgently needed by the trust fund so that these families can finally start rebuilding their lives."" The biggest contributor to the ILO fund has been Matalan's budget rival Primark, which is paying $12m to support victims, $8m of which is counted as part of the ILO-backed scheme. It began making payments directly to workers this month, while other applications for compensation from the communal scheme have only just got under way. Benetton, which had sourced from within Rana Plaza for some time and has acknowledged that some unauthorised orders were in production at the time of the disaster, has chosen to back a separate victim support scheme led by BRAC. It says it did so because it wanted to move quickly to support those affected. The Clean Clothes Campaign has called on Benetton to pay $5m into the ILO-backed scheme. Other chains that have donated to the ILO scheme include Bonmarché, Gap, Walmart, C&A, H&M, Zara-owner Inditex, Loblaw and Mango. Some, however, have put as little as $200,000 into the pot and are being called on to increase their contributions."
550	551	Fresh, but not so easy: Tesco joins a long list of British failure in America 	"Major British stores may think twice before trying to break into the US market after , the UK's largest retailer, last week admitted its American dream was over. The supermarket has appointed advisers to ""review"" the future of its Fresh & Easy stores in California, Arizona and Nevada after running up more than £1.5bn of investment bills and accumulated losses in five years. Such a review usually means finding a partner to share the costs, an outright sale or a shutdown; chief executive Philip Clarke has conceded that the probable outcome is that Tesco will exit the US. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analysts Conlumino, says: ""If a player with the resources, scale and expertise of Tesco can't make it, what hope is there for everyone else?"" Indeed, Tesco is only the latest British retailer to have attempted to leap over the pond – and drowned. The past couple of decades have seen rival supermarket Sainsbury's, as well as Marks & Spencer, WH Smith, Dixons and HMV all forced to beat a retreat. Some have underestimated the costs of breaking into such a large and highly competitive market; others took on stores that were far too expensive or, like Tesco, hit the US just as it headed for economic downturn. Many past transatlantic ventures have been the victim of arrogance and poor preparation, failing to understand the surprising differences between US and British shoppers. We may, broadly, speak the same language, listen to the same music and watch the same films, but other tastes and habits can differ quite dramatically. , and put in two years of intensive on-the-ground research, even sending senior executives to live with Californian families to observe the way they shopped and ate. They built secret test stores and investigated the contents of Americans' fridges. But experts say Tesco then ignored much of that research, deciding to set up the stores it wanted, rather than listening to its potential customers. For example, although US shoppers prefer to buy in bulk to save money, Fresh & Easy offered small pack sizes. The stores also stocked British-style ready meals unfamiliar to US shoppers and initially relied heavily on self-service tills. This was a big turn-off to American customers, who value good service. Like many British retailers before it, Tesco also struggled to get the right kind of stores in the right places. It had planned to open several hundred small stores very quickly; it needed 500 outlets to justify its investment in a US food factory and a vast warehouse. . Even finding properties was tricky. As an incomer, any British retailer is fighting for locations with established competitors. According to experts, Tesco got some of its locations wrong, opening aspirational grocery stores in low-income areas. Saunders says: ""Tesco wasn't able to find enough stores close to its distribution centre. It's difficult in a very crowded and competitive market, with a lot of players doing a good job."" What's more, as news of Tesco's arrival broke the local competition responded. US grocery giant Walmart hired David Wild, a former Tesco executive, and Aldi USA, an arm of the German discount grocer, also revealed that it was planning a string of stores in California, Fresh & Easy's heartland. But one source who knows the retailer well says Tesco's US adventure was most severely hit by the timing of the sub-prime crisis and the subsequent global economic downturn. Las Vegas, one of Fresh & Easy's target cities, had been the fastest-growing metropolis in the US but soon turned into its repossession capital. In 2009, 12% of the city's residents received a foreclosure notice. Phoenix, Arizona, another focus for Fresh & Easy, was also particularly hard hit by the housing crash. Fresh & Easy's upscale heat-and-eat dinners were never going to be top of the weekly shopping list for US families struggling to pay their mortgages and keep their jobs. But some British companies have been here before: WH Smith had to sell its stores in American hotels and airports amid the travel and retail downturn that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. US retailers, however, see the current downturn as an opportunity to pile into the UK. Chains including fashion stores Forever 21 and Hollister and lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret have snapped up outlets abandoned by British retailers suffering from poor sales and a switch to the internet. And Michelle Obama's favourite label, J Crew, is also looking for a store in London. They are following in the footsteps of Gap, the now-ubiquitous clothing retailer, and Walmart, which owns Britain's second-largest supermarket, Asda. Companies from Apple to Banana Republic and Urban Outfitters also seem to have settled into the UK quite comfortably. Many of these successful interlopers are fashion stores, who are able to offer the British public something truly different. This same advantage has helped some British retailers do well over the Atlantic, including Topshop, Ted Baker and Burberry. Generally US retailers have been able to exploit their bigger resources to adapt to the British market, tweaking their ranges, store size and pricing to suit. But it is hard for British retailers to match their financial power. Taking on the huge US market can drain not only financial resources but management time too. Dave McCarthy, a retail analyst at Investec, says: ""Tesco sent the A team to run the US operation and, by definition, that left behind the B team running the UK side."" Tim Mason, Tesco's deputy chief executive, moved to California to run Fresh & Easy. He was also the grocer's marketing supremo, the man who dreamed up the Clubcard and built the brand's classless image in the UK. He kept that top marketing role even when he was in Los Angeles – 5,000 miles away from Tesco's core domestic market – and the brand's image at home took a substantial battering. Many of the UK stores need revamping, the chain's prices are no longer viewed as the sharpest, and service levels have been allowed to slide. This is all a result of investment in British stores being put on the back burner as profits from home were poured into the US business. McCarthy says it is no coincidence that many British retailers have failed across the Atlantic at a time when they are struggling at home. Both Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer, for example, were forced to sell off their US businesses as they dealt with problems in the UK. ""It's a chicken-and-egg situation. Is it the distraction of going overseas that means management is no longer focused on the home market, or failure at home that drags down the business overseas?"" asks McCarthy. Still, a business the size of Tesco has to take calculated risks from time to time or risk stagnating. After five years of trying, Tesco did manage to turn Fresh & Easy into a store that enjoyed higher sales per square metre than a typical US supermarket, which shows it wasn't rejected outright by US shoppers. McCarthy says: ""I still honestly believe that if they had used the right strategy they could have got it right, and blown the market apart."""
556	557	Primark told to ‘Stop Scrooging’ by living wage campaigners 	Campaigners are to raise the spectre of Scrooge and the “ghost of Christmas present” at Associated British Food’s annual shareholder meeting on Friday over low-paid staff at its chain. The Rev Graham Hunter of St John’s Church, Hoxton, which is an active member institution of Citizens UK, is to dress as a lead character from Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol and quiz Primark’s parent company on whether it is willing to offer staff fair pay at Friday’s annual shareholder meeting as part of a campaign to persuade more retailers to pay the living wage. The “stop scrooging” campaign, also backed by ShareAction, has calculated that employees should be paid at least £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 outside London in order to afford life’s essentials such as food and housing. Hunter said: “Christmas is about care, compassion and giving. I hope that by asking Primark to pay their staff a living wage the retailer will realise the benefits they can gain both reputationally, but also the increased loyalty, motivation and productivity their staff will give back to them once they feel they are valued by their employer. “Paying the living wage is the right moral decision to make and a savvy business choice.” Sainsbury’s, Argos, M&S, Debenhams, Sports Direct, Next, Carphone Warehouse, John Lewis, Tesco, Morrisons, and B&Q will also be targeted. Activists will attend Debenhams’ annual shareholder meeting next week while a “punk magician” named “G” will lead activists in replacing pricing labels on shelves with spoof labels which call on stores and shoppers to support the living wage for shop staff. Campaigners will also tweet retailers asking them to pay staff the living wage using the hashtag #stopscrooging. Eighteen of Britain’s FTSE 100 companies are now accredited living wage employers, including big names such as Barclays, Pearson, and Legal & General. However, none of the UK’s large listed retailers pay the living wage, with . Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, says: “Low pay costs the taxpayer money – firms that pay the minimum wage are seeing their workers’ pay topped up through the benefits system.” Research, conducted by Markit for KPMG, shows 43% of part-time workers earn less than the living wage, compared with 13% of full-time employees. This article was amended on 2 December 2014. An earlier version incorrectly described the Rev Graham Hunter as the leader of Citizens UK. 
557	558	Muddying the Gap: how the US clothing chain has failed to uphold its identity 	he news that , as well as a number of European branches, underlines just how much the fashion industry has changed since the US chain’s 1990s heyday. When Alanis Morissette was on the radio and Friends was on TV, Gap’s chinos and khaki combats were an essential part of a fashionable wardrobe. “Gap provided customers with a uniform, which worked so well for Generation X,” says Bernadette Kissane, apparel and footwear analyst at Euromonitor International. “Gap innovated constantly – with product and also with marketing, being the first fashion company to run TV advertisements. The Gap uniform became so trendy that celebrities wore it, too.” The high street was very different then. In Britain, Topshop and H&M had yet to be rejuvenated. Zara and were not churning out copies of trends, while the Japanese high-performance wear of Uniqlo and sexy Californian spandex of American Apparel had yet to become ubiquitous. The Scandi minimalism of Cos was but a twinkle in H&M’s eye. I recently went to Gap and it was the most depressing retail experience I’ve had in a very long time Over the past 10 years, those brands have parked their tanks on Gap’s lawn, and the US chain has failed to meaningfully defend itself. While the emerging brands have been clear about their unique selling points, Gap’s identity has become muddied. “The key problem is that they have not innovated with product,” says Kissane. “It also feels as though neither they or their consumer know exactly who they are targeting.” Gap was founded in San Francisco in 1969, the brainchild of husband-and-wife team Donald and Doris Fisher, to sell Levi jeans and LPs. It was an immediate success, expanded rapidly across the US and started selling own-brand clothing in the 1970s. But it was under chief executive Millard “Mickey” Drexler in the 1990s that the Gap really took off. Sweatshirts with the Gap logo became ubiquitous, the brand went on TV and Gap’s American casual became a trademark look. The shares hit $52. Towards the end of the decade, however, the retailer ran out of steam. In 2002 Drexler was fired and the shares dipped to just $8. He went on to run J Crew, and has turned it into an upmarket US brand with a loyal following and celebrity fans including Michelle Obama and Jake Gyllenhaal. In the post-Drexler era at Gap, however, senior executives have come and gone. The latest chief executive, Art Peck, took over last autumn, and he has work to do: a trading update released last month shows the Gap brand’s sales over the first quarter were down 10% on last year’s levels. In April they were down 15% on 2014. In May they were down 6%. Banana Republic – also owned by Gap, has similar problems. The shares are standing at $38 – well short of their peak in 2000. In 2012 Gap sought to address its problems by hiring creative director Rebekah Bay – the driving force behind Cos. But the quiet, nuanced designs that had worked for the sophisticated customers at Cos did not translate worldwide. In January this year, and Gap scrapped the creative director position entirely, replacing it with a far more corporate-sounding role – executive vice-president, Gap product design and development. For David Watts, a fashion industry adviser, this was a huge mistake. “Having a strong creative vision is absolutely crucial. It feels like Gap could not find the right person so instead they did away with the role; that suggests a problem with the management more than the brand.” Watts believes that as Gap became a mega-brand its bureaucratic processes have become slow and complex, and those issues have trickled right down to the shop floor. “I recently went to Gap for the first time in a long time,” he says, “and it was the most depressing retail experience I’ve had in a very long time. The lighting, the fixtures, the scratched floorboards – everything was dull. There was nothing I was inspired to pick up.” Certainly, the subdued Gap shopping experience feels nothing like stepping into Topshop or Urban Outfitters – where music pumps and lights are bright. Yet it is millennials, or Generation Y (those born between the 1980s and the 2000s), that most analysts believe Gap needs to attract. “That’s where most of the disposable money and the customer base and the interest in fashion is right now,” says Kissane. “But millennials’ concept of value is very different to Generation X. They expect trends far more quickly and cheaply than Gap has been delivering them.” Oddly enough, many of the ideas that made Gap so popular 20 years ago – understatement, androgyny, clothes as uniform – are bang on trend right now, seen at designers ranging from Alexander Wang to Celine. The street style version of this trend has been described as normcore – wearing anti-trend, anti-label clothes of the type favoured by unlikely style inspirations such as Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, in an ironic way. Gap dipped a toe in the normcore waters late last year with its Dress Normal campaign, featuring celebrities including Anjelica Houston and Mad Men’s Elisabeth Moss. Normcore clothes are styled with irony – oversized shirts; wilfully nerdy trousers cut off awkwardly at the ankle. Gap’s watered down version was just, well, normal, and came a good nine months after the idea of normcore had . In the digital age, nine months is an incredibly long time. Being fleet of foot is a significant challenge for a giant like Gap. The company has pledged that its streamlined operation will be a lot faster to react to trends. While the store closures are terrible news for thousands of employees, Kissane believes they will help bring the chain into line with the demands of the modern age: “In 2014, internet sales made up 13% of global apparel retailing; in 2009 that was just 5%, so that is growing really rapidly,” she says. Now what Gap needs is excellent product and a brand message so loud and clear it can be heard clearly worldwide. As Gap’s problem is that it has become the very thing millennials detest: – the internet generation’s favourite insult right now, meaning boring, clichéd, blah. It’s a word even most of those born before 1980 are now familiar with, since Kate Moss hurled the diss at the pilot on her easyJet flight. While the Croydon supermodel may be be generation X to her core, she has at least mastered the essentials of generation Y’s lingo. If Gap really is to put millennials at the heart of its business plan, the least it needs to do is follow suit.
560	561	US fast-food workers fight McDonald's as battle for better wages heads to court 	"Richard Eiker has worked for McDonald's for 25 years. For the last 18 he has been at the same Kansas City restaurant working in maintenance, mopping floors, cleaning bathrooms, scrubbing grease out of the deep fat fryers. He has no illusions about who he works for: . The burger chain begs to differ. Over the last 30 years fast food jobs have come to take an ever larger part of the US labour market. In 2013 3.6 million people worked for fast food restaurants in the US. But most – 76% – worked for franchisees and not directly for the companies whose logos adorn the restaurants. Wages, hours, benefits – increasingly hot topics in this low-paying industry – have to be negotiated with the franchisee. That may be about to change. Last week the National Labour Relations Board (NLRB), which investigates unfair employment practices, ruled that McDonald's could be held jointly liable for employment and wage violations by its franchise operators. The ruling followed a flood of complaints about retaliation against workers after a series of strikes and protests over wages and conditions at McDonald's and its competitors. Eiker, who earns $11.05 (£6.56) an hour, joined the by going on strike. He doesn't blame the franchisee, he blames McDonald's. ""McDonald's says it's not a boss, but it certainly acts like one. Setting rules and controlling just about every aspect of its stores, so that the only thing that franchisees can skimp on is wages,"" he said after the ruling. He said the rules imposed by McDonald's made it impossible for the franchisee to increase wages. To him it's clear who is really in charge. McDonald's corporate representatives turn up at the restaurant where he works five or six times a year, counting the number of cars using the drive-though service, timing sales, making sure staff are preparing food according to McDonald's specifications, said Eiker. The company sends in secret shoppers to check how long it takes to get served, whether staff are smiling or not, how advertising is displayed. Once a month the manager gets a report from McDonald's on the secret shoppers' findings. ""There are repercussions if, for example, a drive order took too long to fill. People have been suspended for getting a negative review from the secret shoppers,"" he said. Eiker said a clear example of McDonald's involvement was the corporate computer system that gives up-to-the minute reports on employees and sales. ""Managers are pushing all the time to bring down costs,"" he said. ""I have heard comments that labour is too high, and when that happens people get sent home."" Richard Griffin Jr, the NLRB's general counsel, agrees with Eiker that the company has too much say not to be counted as a ""joint employer"". But the argument will not stop there. McDonald's and the National Restaurant Association have made clear they would appeal. Griffin will have to argue his case before an administrative law judge, the NLRB will have to vote on it after that and, if it were approved as expected, opponents would inevitably take it back to court. Catherine Fisk, law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said there was a long road ahead for the case, and it might end up in the supreme court. Despite the difficulties ahead, Fisk said the decision marked a historic moment that could potentially change who had to come to the table to discuss labour issues. Franchisees asked to increase wages or hours could argue they have little room to manoeuvre on costs, as they have to pay McDonald's. They cannot increase food prices or make any other significant changes to their businesses without McDonald's consent. With McDonald's defined as a joint employer, unions could press for greater recognition instead of having to unionise one franchise at a time. The Service Employees International Union, a two million-strong union that represents healthcare and public service workers, has financed much of the backlash against the fast food firms as it has sought to unionise their workers. With McDonald's involved in wage negotiations, it would be impossible for the company to palm off the reason its workers receive such low wages to its franchisees, said Fisk. The business community is up in arms. Angelo Amador, vice-president of labour and workforce at the National Restaurant Association, said: ""This decision shakes the very basis of our industry and how we've created jobs."" Amador said the decision overturned 30 years of law that a company was not responsible for the labour practices of its franchisees and that it threatened job growth across the US, not just in restaurants but in construction, manufacturing and any area where work is contracted out. He suggested that this was a political decision and said the NLRB had always been ""anything but impartial"". He added: ""It's always been semi-political but this is unprecedented."" The dispute comes amid rising protests about the treatment of fast food workers and an increasingly heated debate over an increase in the federal minimum wage that has been championed by President Barack Obama and challenged by business and Republican opponents. For Fisk, the NLRB's move is a small step on the path to a wider debate about how the law adapts to ""the business structures that now dominate low-wage work"". As long as the companies can put their franchisees between them and their workers, that debate will be stifled, she said. ""We've all had those conversations with airline workers where they've been told: 'Gee, I'd like to help you, but I can't.' Well, that's no negotiation at all,"" said Fisk. ""What workers want is for McDonald's to be at the negotiation table."""
564	565	Viber banned in Bangladesh 	Bangladeshi telecoms authorities have shut down smartphone messaging service , which had become a popular communication medium for anti-government protesters. The Telecommunications and Regulatory Commission closed down the app “for the time being” on orders from law enforcement and security agencies, a commission spokesman told AFP. He did not give reasons for the decision, but local television station Channel 24 said Viber was shut down to prevent protesters from “exchanging information” across the country. Viber has been popular among opposition protesters, including activists from the Bangladesh Nationalist party and its Islamist allies who have launched a crippling nationwide transport blockade to try to topple the government. The protests, now in their third week, have turned increasingly violent with activists firebombing hundreds of buses and trucks and security forces retaliating with live bullets or tear gas. At least 25 people have died in the latest violence including about a dozen burned to death after protesters firebombed buses. The government has deployed thousands of police, paramilitaries and an elite anti-militant force to crack down on the protesters. But the violence has continued unabated, disrupting transport services and shipments of garments, the country’s biggest export. 
574	575	Warren Buffett calls for higher taxes for US super-rich 	"In the process of accumulating one of the greatest fortunes the world has ever seen, stands apart from the average squillionaire. Not for him the clichés of lavish mansions and superyachts, preferring instead his modest home in Omaha, Nebraska and nights in with burger and cherry cola. Now Buffett has added to his list of atypical pronouncements by saying that America's super-rich should pay more tax if the country's debt problems are ever to be solved. , Buffett argued that the richest members of US society are indulged with an unfairly generous tax regime and are not making a fair contribution to repairing the country's finances. ""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" wrote Buffett, whose personal fortune was estimated at $50bn (£30bn) by Forbes this year, making him the third richest person in the world behind Carlos Slim and Bill Gates.

Buffett, known as the Sage of Omaha, built his fortune on a no-frills investment strategy and was a fierce critic of the exotic financial investments that brought the banking system to it knees in 2008, dubbing them instruments of financial mass destruction. A long-time critic of the US tax system, he has calculated that he handed over 17.4% of his income as tax last year – a lower proportion than any of the 20 other people who work in his office. Under agreed in Washington, a ""super committee"" of 12 congressmen and senators must find to help cut America's national debt. Tax rises are hugely unpopular with elements within the Republican party, with the Tea Party movement adamant that America should balance its books by cutting public spending. Buffett argues that this super-committee should raise the tax rate paid by those earning more than $1m a year, including earnings from capital gains which are currently taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Those raking in upward of $10m a year could then pay even more. The package of tax cuts brought in by President George W Bush are set to expire at the end of 2012, although they could be extended. Many of the leading Republicans who hope to challenge Barack Obama at the next presidential election have argued for lower taxation to stimulate the .

582	583	Standard Chartered faces fresh US fines over money laundering rule breach 	" has said it faces fresh fines from US authorities for breaching money laundering rules, as it reported a 20% fall in first-half profits. Two years ago, the Asia-focused bank was . It said new issues had now arisen that could lead to fresh penalties from the New York State department of financial services (NYSDFS). The revelations about additional penalties and the possible extension of a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the US authority – which has installed a monitor in the bank – could put fresh pressure on the chief executive, Peter Sands, who said that the first-half results were ""clearly disappointing"". Difficult conditions in its Korean business and its financial markets operations were behind the 20% fall in profits to $3.2bn, which the once fast-growing bank flagged in June. The shares closed 0.7% down at £12.08 as the bank, which came through the financial crisis relatively unscathed, attempted to reassure the market its capital position was strong. Referring to the latest regulatory setback, Sands said: ""This is a very different set of issues than we faced in 2012."" Then, the bank was caught by surprise by NYSDFS accusations about breaches of sanctions to Iran. Now, Sands said, technical problems had been unearthed about computer systems put in place by the bank in 2007 to look for suspicious transactions. In legal warnings attached to its first-half results, the bank said: ""Certain issues have been identified with respect to the group's post-transaction surveillance system, which is part of its anti-money-laundering systems and controls and is separate from the group's sanctions screening systems."" It added: ""The group believes that the resolution of these issues is likely to involve an enforcement action by the NYSDFS that would include an extension of the term of the monitor beyond the original two-year term, a monetary penalty and remedial actions."" Last month, the Standard Chartered board issued a after reports that shareholders wanted change at the top of a bank that had previously reported 10 years of rising profits. The long-standing finance director Richard Meddings left in June. Sands, when asked about his position, said: ""I have no other plans."" Defending his role, he said: ""It is worth noting that, despite the disappointing first half of 2014, we delivered more profit for our shareholders during these six months than we did in the whole of 2006 at the peak of the pre-crisis banking boom. Not many banks can make that claim."" Presenting the figures to City analysts, Sands sat alongside Sir John Peace, the chairman, whose position has also been questioned. Peace warned of the impact of fresh regulations hitting banking . ""The intensity of regulatory pressure and political risk, at a time of market weakness, is putting huge pressure on bank boards and management leadership generally."""
588	589	Standard Chartered CEO Peter Sands can forget career-enhancing moves 	"It is just a week since the CEO of , Peter Sands, insisted that Benjamin Lawsky, of the New York Department of Financial Services, was talking utter rubbish. The bank, said Sands, had not concealed $250bn (£160bn) of US sanction-busting transactions with the Iranian government. He came out fighting and branded the allegations as ""incorrect as a matter of law"". He claimed 99.9% of the transactions were clean, although he did fess up to $14m of accidental dealings. So the obvious question is, why agree to pay a fine of $340m? That would have covered a lot of lawyers' fees to allow Sands to prove his point. Instead, as part of the settlement, Standard Chartered agreed with Lawsky that business worth ""at least $250bn"" was at issue. There are analysts, and investors, who will say the agreed settlement is a good result, allowing this little local difficulty to be swept away and the bank to move on with its vital New York banking licence intact. There were suggestions the fine could be north of $500m. Dutch bank ING paid $600m to settle similar allegations. But several things are not intact, notably the reputations of Sands and finance director Richard Meddings (who, Lawsky's report suggested, had taken issue with ""fucking Americans"" telling the bank who they could and could not do business with). Sands might just hold on to his job, such is the store of goodwill he has built up among investors, but he can forget any aspirations to be the next governor of the Bank of England. Meddings, tipped as a potential head of Barclays, can similarly forget any career enhancing moves. The already near-shredded status of British banks has also taken another hammer blow. After Barclays' Libor rigging and HSBC's Mexican money laundering scandal, we now have Standard Chartered branded as a facilitator for ""terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes"". Can it really get much worse for the banking sector? Worryingly, the $340m agreed on Tuesday is a settlement with just one regulator. Sands admits four others are also looking at the same claims. Might there be more ""settlements"" to come? Those analysts and shareholders who think Sands still worth backing really need to find some moral fibre."
591	592	Sir John Peace suffers latest shareholder revolt at Experian 	"Serial boardroom director Sir John Peace is under pressure after facing a hat-trick of shareholder rebellions at the three FTSE 100 firms he chairs. Following his recent embarrassments with revolts over pay at high fashion retailer Burberry and bank, investors in Experian vented their anger over succession planning at the credit-checking company. After Peace had chaired his last annual meeting of Experian – the company he founded more than 30 years ago – that 30% of investors had failed to support the election to the board of his successor, Don Robert. The revolt by nearly one in three investors came after which warned that Robert's appointment to chairman breached City codes stipulating that chief executives should not jeopardise the independent oversight of the board by stepping up to the crucial role of chairman. It came on a day when other top companies also faced dissent from investors. At Icap, the interdealer broker run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, while at Aberdeen-based transport company First Group pay deals for its boss, Tim O'Toole. The revolts come amid heightened scrutiny of pay at leading companies after business secretary Vince Cable gave shareholders a new vote on future pay deals for bosses. At while at At the focus had been on succession planning and while just a handful of investors attended the annual meeting in Dublin, the drama came in votes that had been cast before the meeting by institutional investors. About 11% of investors voted against Robert's re-election to the board but the level of opposition rose to 30% if deliberate abstentions are included. Company directors usually expect a much more solid endorsement by their shareholders, as was the case for the other directors on the Experian board who were elected with about 98% support. Robert has been chief executive of Experian since it was spun out of GUS in 2006 and floated on the stock market. He has received £45m over five years and there was also a smaller revolt over pay after 15% of investors failed to support the remuneration report. He took up his new post as chairman after the annual meeting where he paid tribute to his predecessor's ""foresight, leadership and determination"". But shareholders said they were frustrated by Peace's oversight of the companies he continued to chair. One said: ""He has a reputation of being difficult and is not helping to foster good relationships between the companies' management and major shareholders"". Experian focused on the 90% of votes cast in favour of Robert's re-election rather than the level of dissent. ""As chairman, Don brings considerable value to Experian and has unrivalled, deep knowledge of the business which he has built up over nine highly successful years as chief executive officer. The board places enormous value on Don remaining with the business, particularly given the retirement of founder Sir John Peace,"" . ""We endeavour to listen carefully to our shareholders and are always happy to engage with any investors on this or any other resolution that was put to today's meeting."" Investor advisory bodies such as the Investment Management Association had warned about the breaches of corporate governance codes, issuing an ""amber top"" alert before the annual meeting to signal potential concerns. An amber top is its second highest warning. It is thought that investor bodies were also concerned about the bonuses at money broker Icap – – as there is no upper limit on the amount that can be paid out. At the annual meeting in the London headquarters of the broker, chairman Charles Gregson told shareholders: ""Our remuneration policy is historical, the process is changing and during this coming year we will be consulting with shareholders on a new design of the policy in 2016."" At First Group, Wednesday's rebellion was less strong than the 30% vote against pay policies in 2013. ""Imelda Walsh, the newly appointed chair of our remuneration committee, will engage with investors to seek their views and ensure ongoing support for the group's remuneration policy and practices,"" a First Group spokesman said."
592	593	UK banks face Libor subpoenas from US regulators 	There is fresh speculation that banks could face action from the US authorities for manipulating , after reports that several banks are being required to co-operate with the New York regulators. Banks including Barclays – already hit with a record-breaking £290m fine for attempting to manipulate the key interest rates – as well as HSBC and the bailed-out are reported to have received subpoenas from the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and Connecticut's George Jepsen, who are jointly investigating the alleged rigging of Libor. JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Deutsche and Citigroup are also said to have received requests for co-operation. All of the banks have already said they are co-operating with authorities in the US and other parts of the world in the investigation, which has been going on for more than a year. The fine covered two offences: traders manipulating the rates to help each other and rivals; and during the 2008 banking crisis submitting rates that were lower than they should have been to avoid any impression that the bank was in difficulty. Bob Diamond quit as Barclays chief executive in the wake of the fine, as did Jerry del Missier, his close colleague who instructed the bank's Libor submitters to cut their rates during the 2008 crisis after misunderstanding a conversation with Diamond. Barclays is still seeking Diamond's successor but last week named Sir David Walker as chairman from 1 November, when Marcus Agius will step down. The RBS chief executive, Stephen Hester, warned last month that his bank was also likely to face fines. UK regulators have embarked on a review of Libor, which is set when banks submit their estimate of the price they would need to pay to borrow from other banks over periods ranging from overnight to 12 months, in a range of currencies. Martin Wheatley, the senior Financial Services Authority figure conducting the review, will report back next month on how the interest rate used to price financial products around the world can be reformed.
593	594	HSBC money-laundering fine: key players 	"Britain's biggest bank was that it allowed itself to be used to launder billions of dollars for drug barons and potential terrorists for nearly a decadeuntil 2010. The US department of justice said HSBC had moved $881m for two drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia and accepted $15bn in unexplained ""bulk cash"", across the bank's counters in , Russia and other countries. In some branches the boxes of cash being deposited were so big the tellers' windows had to be enlarged. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver insists the bank is now under new management and will not make the same mistakes again – although both he and chairman Douglas Flint were in top roles while the money laundering activities were still going on. Gulliver and Flint are now giving more responsibility to group business heads – ending the policy that country heads of the bank's outposts around the world should be ""kings"" of their businesses. The US authorities said did not face criminal charges because the bank was too big to prosecute and no individuals were implicated. So where are the bosses who presided over HSBC's years as banker to drug lords, terrorists and rogue states ? Left HSBC in 2006 after 45 years. He was chairman of the bank between 1998 to 2006 and chief executive before that from 1998. After quitting the bank he became chairman of other major companies, including telecoms company Vodafone (until 2011) and mining company Xstrata. Last month he promised to step down from that role when shareholders rebelled against his plan to reward Xstrata's top bosses with special bonuses totalling £170m as part of a plan to merge with rival Glencore. Left HSBC at the end of 2010 to take up a seat in the Lords and become a trade minister for the coalition government. He was chief executive of HSBC between 2003 and 2006 when he was promoted to chairman, the role he held until he joined the government. He is also a lay preacher and retains his role as a trade minister Left HSBC as a result of Green's decision to enter government. He was chief executive from 2006 and hoped to step up to chairman. But he lost out in an internal battle and quit after 37 years. In 2010, amid a row about bankers' bonuses, Geoghegan diverted his £4m bonus to charity - one run by his wife Jania. He has since advised the Irish government on its ""bad bank"" Nama. 4. Spent four decades at HSBC before retiring in July this year, just before the US Senate levelled its first accusations about the bank's operations in Mexico helping to facilitate drug barons. He had been head of the Mexican business from 2002 until 2006, then took on a job in Asia. He is now unwell. The head of compliance dramatically resigned before the July Senate committee hearing although did not actually leave the bank until November. The register of individuals maintained by the Financial Services Authority now describes him as ""inactive""."
597	598	HSBC tax evasion customers in India told to get a lawyer 	HSBC customers in India suspected of tax evasion have been given 30 days to nominate a legal representative in or face seeing their names published in the country’s official gazette. The bank has in the last two weeks forwarded a letter from the Swiss government to a select number of Indian customers, which warns that Switzerland is now prepared to give “administrative assistance” to Indian tax investigators. This could take the form of disclosing the identities of owners of Suisse accounts, the assets they contained, and details of individual transactions. Tax evaders who refuse to cooperate will be publicly named. has been trying for five years to bring to book those who hid fortunes in black accounts opened with HSBC’s now notorious private bank. Customers have one month to nominate a third party based in Switzerland, such as a lawyer, to manage or challenge the disclosure process on their behalf, according to a spokesman for Switzerland’s State Secretariat for International Finance. He said: “Our law does not allow the Swiss government to send tax inquiries to citizens of other countries. That is why they need to nominate a third party in Switzerland. Customers have 30 days to provide an address in Switzerland, otherwise the Swiss government will publish their name in the official gazette. It is a normal procedure in administrative assistance. “Only a very small number of HSBC clients are concerned. These are limited cases where the Indian authorities had additional information.” In February, about 1,200 Indian clients were revealed to have held HSBC accounts in Geneva, with the names of leading political and business families published by the Indian Express newspaper as part of a global exposé by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The data was expected to significantly widen the scope of a special investigation team appointed by India’s supreme court which had been given a list of 628 names by the French government in 2011. France obtained the leaked data from the HSBC whistleblower Hervé Falciani in 2008 and distributed it to tax authorities around the world. However, the Swiss have refused to disclose details of accounts based on the stolen data. Governments asking for assistance have been told to provide new proof obtained legally by their own investigators. As a result, Switzerland will disclose information on just a handful of the HSBC clients. The exact number of those caught in the administrative assistance process has not been disclosed. HSBC confirmed the bank had written to clients following a request from the Swiss government in line with its legal obligations. Until now, Switzerland has successfully resisted pressure to share information. Official statistics show that in 2014, the Helvetic Confederation received requests for international administrative assistance in 2,791 cases. . But international pressure is mounting. Since , other countries have come forward seeking assistance. Argentina wants HSBC to repatriate $3.5bn (£2.4bn) sent offshore by more than 4,000 of its wealthiest citizens. . On Thursday, Greece joined the fray. Jacques de Watteville, Switzerland’s lead diplomat for international tax and banking affairs, met the Greek minister of state, Nikos Pappas, to hammer out a deal. Greek tax evaders would be asked to report themselves under an amnesty or face having their accounts closed, reported Alliance News in Athens. The two countries are also considering setting up an automatic exchange of data.
598	599	Osborne praises India's Modi as he kicks off trade mission 	" has praised the controversial new Indian prime minister Narendra Modi for creating a mood of change in India, as he landed in the country on a mission to strike a series of multimillion pound trade deals. The chancellor and the foreign secretary, William Hague, are the first senior British politicians due to meet Modi, the Hindu nationalist leader, . Speaking from Mumbai, Osborne said Modi's popularity showed the coalition had been right to re-establish contact with him in 2012. The last government broke off relations with the former mayor of Gujarat after he was accused in 2002 of allowing, or even encouraging, riots that killed 1,000 people, largely Muslims. A supreme court investigation found insufficient evidence to support the charges against Modi, who has always denied any wrongdoing. The government wants British companies to do well out of Modi's promised construction boom, as the new prime minister has pledged to build 100 new cities, roads, railways and ports. , Hague and Osborne also said Britain wants to expand its military exports to the country. ""We want our defence and aerospace companies to help bring India more cutting-edge technology, skills and jobs,"" they wrote. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Osborne defended the UK's efforts to sell military equipment to Modi, saying has ""difficult neighbours"" and has a right to defend itself. The chancellor said it was ""very early days"" but he had wanted to meet Modi to say Britain and India ""can do lots of good business together, that these good days are coming"". ""We as a new British government took a decision in 2012 to re-establish contact with him,"" Osborne said. ""That has been very sensible given all that has happened since, in the way Mr Modi has managed to win an outright majority for the first time in Indian politics for 30 years, to create a real sense of excitement in India that economic reform is possible and is going to happen."" Osborne said Modi had a better chance of achieving economic reform than some recent Indian governments because ""he's got this enormous mandate for change, [and] in his election he appeals precisely to that young aspirational Indian who wanted to see more economic development in their country and get away from the subsidy culture which had bedevilled a lot of Indian politics."" Osborne compared the appeal of Modi to the coalition's own efforts to ""make the world look at the UK in a new light"". The chancellor and foreign secretary will speak to business leaders in Mumbai about the prospects for the Indian economy since the new prime minister's election. Ahead of the speeches, the two ministers will visit the car company Mahindra, which is investing £20m in an electric vehicles project at Farnham and Donington. They will also announce that Indian pharmaceutical company Cipla is to invest up to £100m in the UK. After visiting Mumbai, Osborne and Hague will go to New Delhi to pay court to Modi, following recent visits by senior French and Russian ministers."
606	607	Argentina seeks to repatriate $3.5bn it claims HSBC helped offshore 	 is seeking to repatriate $3.5bn it claims HSBC secretly helped clients funnel into offshore accounts to evade tax. Ricardo Echegaray, head of the Argentinian tax authority, Afip, said in London on Monday that his officials had identified 4,040 undisclosed bank accounts held by Argentinian individuals and companies in Switzerland through HSBC’s Geneva subsidiary. Afip has already begun legal proceedings in Buenos Aires against the individual account holders for criminal tax evasion, but Echegaray said the authority would also be seeking redress from HSBC’s holding company for facilitating tax evasion through its Argentinian and Swiss branches. The latest revelations emerged on the day directors of HSBC were facing a grilling by a committee of British parliamentarians over the bank’s role in facilitating tax evasion and alleged money laundering. A joint by the Guardian, the BBC, Le Monde and other media outlets into a cache of documents obtained by a former employee of the bank found that it had turned a blind eye to illegal activity of wealthy clients and arms dealers. The Argentinians said they were applying for an international arrest warrant for a UK-domiciled Argentinian accountant, Miguel Abadi, who they allege funnelled $1.4bn offshore through a single London-based investment fund called Gems Advisors. HSBC said in a statement it had been “cooperating fully with Argentine regulators, including the tax authority and the judiciary, since allegations were first made public last year, and we will continue to do so”. Abadi’s spokesman said: “Mr Abadi and Gems Advisors have never had any access to any private Argentinian funds. The funds belong to investors who are banks, pension funds and insurance funds. He has offered full cooperation to the Argentinian authorities, and has not been made aware of any arrest warrant.” According to Echegaray, HSBC’s subsidiary in Argentina designed a platform to help clients hide funds in Swiss accounts. Outside lawyers and accountants set up “ghost” networks of offshore companies, to make the transfers even more opaque. Afip has made formal requests for information on the networks behind the Swiss accounts to the authorities in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, and Uruguay as well. Afip has raided the Argentinian branch of HSBC and seized records and files, but was told many documents relating to the Swiss accounts had been stored at a facility which suffered an arson attack last year. Around 15% of the 4,040 account holders had changed their tax returns and declared offshore accounts since the Afip investigation was made public, the authority said. The Argentinian authorities were given the data on the secret Swiss accounts by the French government, which had itself received them from whistleblower and former employee of HSBC in Switzerland Hervé Falciani. The same leak led to investigations in Belgium and France. The French authorities have recovered £188m in taxes and fines from a list of 3,000 clients and Spain has recovered £220m, also from 3,000 clients. has faced criticism for prosecuting just one out of the 1,000 individuals. The permanent secretary for the revenue, Edward Troup, was also scheduled to appear before MPs on the public accounts committee on Monday.
613	614	US regulators force Standard Chartered to retract Iran sanctions comments 	"US regulators have forced to retract comments by its chairman dismissing its breaches of US sanctions to Iran as ""clerical errors"". Sir John Peace also apologised for remarks, which included describing the bank's breaches as not ""wilful acts"". He made the comments this month at its full-year results press conference. Last year regulators fined Standard Chartered £415m and reached deferred prosecution agreements with the bank to avoid further sanctions. In an unusual step, the bank was forced to issue a formal stock market announcement yesterday by US regulators. In a signed letter by Peace, the chairman said that during the press conference: ""I made certain statements that I very much regret and that were at best inaccurate."" The statement appeared to demonstrate the influence of the US regulators by containing American spellings ""willful"" and ""apologize"". At the press conference questions were asked ""concerning individual employee conduct and compensation"" following the deferred prosecution agreements. Peace had replied, when asked about bonuses for executives: ""We had no wilful act to avoid sanctions; you know, mistakes are made – clerical errors – and we talked about last year a number of transactions which clearly were clerical errors or mistakes that were made."" But Thursday's announcement said: ""My statement that Standard Chartered 'had no willful act to avoid sanctions' was wrong, and directly contradicts Standard Chartered's acceptance of responsibility in the deferred prosecution agreement and accompanying factual statement."" He was sitting alongside the chief ­executive, Peter Sands, and the finance director, Richard Meddings, when he made the remarks, and their names are also contained in the statement. ""To be clear, Standard Chartered Bank unequivocally acknowledges and accepts responsibility, on behalf of the bank and its employees, for past knowing and willful criminal conduct in violating US ­economic sanctions laws and regulations, and related New York criminal laws, as set out in the deferred prosecution agreement,"" Peace said. ""I, Mr Sands, Mr Meddings, and Standard Chartered Bank apologize for the statements I made to the contrary."" The bank would not elaborate on its statement or explain why it had been issued, other to than say that there had been ""discussions"" with US regulators. Sands was forced to cut short his ­holiday last year when regulators published ­documents detailing the breaches of sanctions. One of the documents appeared to indicate that Meddings had said ""fucking Americans"" when warned about the potential breaches of sanctions, though the bank insists that this is not accurate. Sands has admitted that he has been awarded a bonus of nearly £2m for 2012, down 10%, while the bonus pool at the bank, which does most of its business in emerging markets, is down 7%. The settlements were with the office of foreign assets control, the Federal Reserve, the US department of justice and the New York department of financial services (DFS). The period of the offences covered 2001 to the end of 2007 – making it difficult for the bank to claw back bonuses, as such ­provisions were not contained in contracts at the time. The regulators found that $24m (£16m) of transactions processed on behalf of Iranian parties and a total of $109m to Burma, Sudan and Libya also appeared to be in violation of sanction laws. Standard Chartered has stressed that its New York office, during the period, processed $139tn in US dollar payments. The bank has also stressed that it stopped any Iranian-dollar payment business in late 2006 and in the following year stopped any new business with Iranian entities. "

Construction on the store – which will replace an existing one in the city – will begin next year. A Primark spokesperson said: ""We hope to build one of our biggest stores in this important city, and look forward to bringing the best of fashion, the best of everyday clothing and the best of homeware to our customers at the best value on the high street."" The company's move comes amid a retail renaissance in Birmingham, with a new shopping centre anchored by John Lewis also expected to be completed next year. The Pavilions store is part of Primark's plan to open 93,000 sq m (1m sq ft) of new space this year after it took its brand of cut-price fashion to France last year, opening stores in Marseille and Dijon. The retailer has defied the economic downturn and its links to the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh to become one of the fastest-growing retail businesses in western Europe, with more than 270 stores in nine countries – including Spain, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands. Next year it will open its first US store in Boston, Massachusetts."
626	627	Tony Blair has 'no recollection' of Libyan dissident's rendition 	"Tony Blair, prime minister at the time in 2004, has said he had ""no recollection"" of the incident. But he said he was sure the operation would be investigated ""as it should be"". Interviewed for BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, Blair added that it should be remembered that ""people in the Middle East were also trying to fight terrorism and extremism"". Britain's co-operation with at the time was important, the former prime minister said. He referred to , who said the government had been opposed to unlawful rendition. ""As far as I know [the government] kept to that position,"" Blair said. Straw has said: ""We were opposed to unlawful rendition. We were opposed to any use of torture. Not only did we not agree with it; we were not complicit in it and nor did we turn a blind eye to it."" However, Straw has added: ""No foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time."" Blair told the World at One: ""Our security services do a very difficult job in very difficult circumstances. I'm sure the matter will be investigated as it should be."" The US is preventing MPs from seeing evidence of British involvement in the CIA's practice of secretly sending terror suspects to prisons where they faced torture. A federal judge in Washington has used a particular section of the US Freedom of Information Act to block a request from the all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition, chaired by the senior Conservative backbencher Andrew Tyrie. The judge, Ricardo Urbina, ruled that the information must be withheld on the grounds that the parliamentary body was part of a ""foreign government entity"". Tony Lloyd, a deputy chair of the committee and Labour MP for Manchester Central, described the ruling as ""odd"". He said it seemed as though the US was looking for an excuse to withhold the information. It would have been more understandable had the US blocked the request on national security grounds, Lloyd said. ""It's an abuse of the spirit of freedom of information,"" he said. To claim that a parliamentary body was part of the British state was ""not acceptable"", Lloyd added. Defending the position of the CIA, which did not want the relevant documents disclosed, the judge ruled: ""Because the court concludes that the plaintiffs are representatives or subdivisions of a foreign government entity, the court grants the defendants' motion and denies the plaintiffs' motion."" The parliamentary group requested records that would determine Britain's role in assisting the US by ""facilitating such practices, including allowing over-flight or refuelling of planes through or on UK territory or airspace, or by allowing UK territories to be used to hold detainees"". The group referred to statements by the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband saying Diego Garcia, the US base on Britain's Indian Ocean territory, was used for extraordinary renditions. The judge rejected the group's argument that its members acted as individuals and not public officials. By that logic any foreign leader, including the late Kim Jong-il, could submit Freedom of Information Act requests under their individual capacity, the judge said. The CIA's approach echoes that adopted by MI6 and MI5, which have fought to prevent the disclosure in British courts of evidence relating to the US practice of extraordinary rendition. The parliamentary group, meanwhile, is fighting a refusal by the British government to disclose papers that, it says, would reveal UK complicity in the secret flights and subsequent abuse of individual suspects. The information tribunal in London is expected to give a ruling on the request soon."
633	634	Christofer Toumazou's 'lab on a chip' makes preventing illness possible 	"here was a time when the closest Christofer Toumazou thought he would get to the hallowed halls of Imperial College in London was when he was walking down Exhibition road on the way to the science museum, with the workshops of the esteemed institution visible on his right. But at age 23, and without an O level or A level – let alone an Oxbridge degree – on his CV, the young engineer was accepted for a postdoctoral position in the university, beginning a career from there which would see him create a combined digital and analogue mobile phone, an artificial pancreas for type one diabetics and a wireless heart monitor, among other inventions. It is his latest creation, however, which has sparked the most interest and last month earned him a European inventor award. Using a small silicon microchip in a USB, a 'lab on a chip' as it has been coined, DNA data can be analysed within minutes and outside a laboratory. The new technology is aimed at identifying predispositions for hereditary diseases like diabetes and prescribing the exact right dosage for medications, cutting down on the cost of current DNA testing machines. ""My dream was to have a handheld consumer device with … a little USB stick that could look at rapidly screening for genetic mutations of particular diseases, whether it is a predisposition to type two diabetes [or] whether to a type of breast cancer,"" said Toumazou in his office in the Institute of Biomedical Engineering. The new DNA analysis method is the latest instalment in a far from traditional career path for the Greek-Cypriot. Having left school in Cheltenham at 16 with a ""few CSEs"", the most typical route for him to follow would have been in the family catering business until he became inspired by an aunt's husband who was an engineer and from there developed an interest in electrical engineering. Encouraged to do a one year radio and electronics certificate – when the ""whole Greek Cypriot contingent of Cheltenham turned up"" on his first day – he says he found the environment in which he wanted to thrive and went on to a two year general engineering course, a degree at the then Oxford polytechnic and later a PhD. By 23, he had applied for a postdoctoral position at Imperial College and was offered it the same day. The position involved working with industry to reduce the size of a satellite phone at a time when his interest was in analogue – speech, sound and vision – electronics. Thaksin Shinawatra, the former Thai prime minister who then ran a mobile phone operator, asked him to make a combined digital and analogue mobile phone in the 90s, which led to the establishment of Toumaz Technology, a commercial spin-off. His next inspiration came in combining the biological and electronic, working on cochlear implants and directing Toumazou towards healthcare. ""I was very keen on bringing medical grade technology to the consumer,"" he said. Later came the Sensium, a processor termed a ""digital plaster"" which could monitor vital health signs – heart rate, respiration and temperature among others – of patients and then send them to a nurses' station, cutting down on the gaps between observations and leading to prioritisation of patients in accident and emergency departments. At around the same time, his son Marcus – now in his early 20s – got renal failure when he was nine years old. ""For the first time I was on the receiving side of what medical technology was like rather than being in a plush environment trying to develop all these super duper widgets and gadgets and it really, really frightened me,"" he said. This personal development led him to focus on technology which could detect hereditary diseases like his son had which, while it would not have prevented it, would have been able to help manage his condition better. Describing his DNA analysis system as his ""simplest invention but most significant"", Toumazou focuses on the fact that humans differ by 0.1%. That difference, he says, shows whether people can metabolise drugs properly and whether there are different genetic conditions present. His invention uses small silicon microchips which can identify genetic differences which dictate a person's inclination to hereditary diseases like diabetes or how they will react to a drug like warfarin, which is used to treat blood clots. To use the 'lab on a chip' system, a sample of saliva or a swab from inside the mouth is taken and put inside a container with the chip inside. The chip is then put inside a USB stick and plugged into a computer after which results are returned within about 30 minutes. One of the key benefits is the speed of the return of information, said Toumazou. In a situation where a drug is needed to counter a hospital-based infection, the new technology could help determine what drug is needed in a short space of time instead of waiting and risking fatality. Cost savings on conventional DNA-sequencing machines opens the possibility for use in areas like sub-Saharan Africa where clinics can be poorly equipped. DNA Electronics, the company set up by Toumazou around the technology, licences out its patents to companies including Roche, Life Technologies and the National Institute for Health Research of the NHS. The technology has also been licensed out to Geneu, a cosmetics company based on New Bond Street where bespoke anti-ageing products are created based on DNA testing. Toumazou says ""real science"" will get recognised in the industry where there is so much ""placebo science"" and will help in wider acceptance of his invention. ""If it gets recognised, then it will help with my big picture of getting consumer acceptance. It takes the stigma away from it being a medial device and then I can go back to the big picture and it is all about lifestyle,"" he said. The DNA testing takes place on the ""lab on a chip"" where organic semiconductors and sensors which use tiny amounts of chemicals do tests on the spot. The chip can recognise a genetic mutation in a sample which is placed on it and return the results in minutes. This allows the identification of certain hereditary diseases like diabetes. It is through this technology that Toumazou claims doctors will soon be looking at a patient's future medical records instead of their past."
635	636	Ex-HSBC boss Stephen Green: the ethical banker with questions to answer 	Stephen Green, who was boss of during the period covered by the leaked Swiss files, emerged from the global financial crisis with a reputation as the City of London’s ethical banker. It was an image he actively encouraged. An ordained Church of England minister, Lord Green published a book in 2009 entitled Good Value: Reflections on Money, Morality and an Uncertain World. It preached that business leaders should behave not just legally but ethically, going beyond “what you can get away with”. Today, Green faces awkward questions over the culture of lax controls and failures in compliance at HSBC’s Swiss bank. The Geneva subsidiary that routinely allowed clients to withdraw very large sums of cash and that colluded with some to conceal undeclared “black” accounts was created on Green’s watch. The son of a Brighton lawyer, Green began his 28-year career at what was then Hongkong and Shanghai Corporation in 1982. By 1998 he had been singled out for promotion by Sir John Bond, the chairman whose leadership set HSBC on the path to becoming Europe’s largest bank. Green was appointed to the board of HSBC group that year, running investment banking, asset management and crucially, private banking. He retained oversight of the private bank until becoming chief executive. A year later, HSBC bought the Republic National Bank of New York, the business that was merged with other HSBC units to become the new Swiss operation. From 2005, Green was afforded an even closer look at the inner workings of the Geneva business as chair of its supervisory company, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA. But he has so far refused to answer questions on the scandal, telling the Guardian: “As a matter of principle, I will not comment on the business of HSBC, past or present.” The principles Green extolled in his book proposed a different approach to corporate good behaviour. “For companies, where does this responsibility begin?” he asked. “With their boards, of course. There is no other task they have which is more important. It is their job – and one which by its nature will never be complete – to promote and nurture a culture of ethical and purposeful business throughout the organisation.” Green was chief executive of HSBC group from 2003 until being appointed its chairman in 2006. At David Cameron’s invitation he left to join the House of Lords at the end of 2010, donning ermine as Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint and becoming minister for trade and investment. Green, who became a Church of England priest in 1988, voluntarily gave up his HSBC bonus during the banking crisis, but after long years at the bank he also amassed a – large even by City standards. Despite being richly rewarded for his role, Green has never been grilled over the goings-on in Geneva. On the contrary, he left the private sector to a chorus of praise after steering HSBC safely through the global financial meltdown. Unlike the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC was not forced to turn to British taxpayers for help. As one of the world’s strongest banks, it remained a rare provider of liquidity to the markets and, when in need of cash – a chunky £12.5bn of it – investors were more than happy to stump up. “In Stephen we will be appointing a minister with a long career as a leading international banker,” business secretary Vince Cable trumpeted when Green joined his department in 2011, “one of the few to emerge with credit from the recent financial crisis, and somebody who has set out a powerful philosophy for ethical business.” A source close to Cable said Green’s appointment as trade minister had been made by Cameron. Contacted by the Guardian on Monday as to his view on his former junior ministerin the light of the HSBC revelations, Cable said: “We simply don’t know at present if Lord Green was aware of or condoned these practices.” Regulators began to catch up with HSBC in 2012, when the US for allowing its international branches in Mexico and elsewhere to become a conduit for “drug kingpins and rogue nations”. With Green leading trade missions to Mexico and Colombia at the time, there were calls from Labour in opposition for a full explanation. But the minister said he had no plans to quit. “HSBC has expressed regret that there were failures at implementation ... and I share that regret,” Green said in a to Chris Leslie, financial secretary to the UK Treasury for Labour By the end of 2013, however, Green had left government after two years in post. The prime minister stood by his decision to appoint Green on Monday, saying: “Stephen Green was an excellent trade minister, he did a good job. But I’d also add no government has done more than this one to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance.” Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of parliament’s influential public accounts committee, is due to grill the country’s most senior tax collector, HMRC chief executive Lin Homer, and Indra Morris, director general for tax and welfare at the Treasury, on Wednesday. She has now told Sky News that she is willing to call Green to parliament to account for the HSBC files.
638	639	HSBC faces charges of fraud and money laundering from Belgian state 	 is facing charges of fraud and money laundering from authorities in Belgium, who accuse the Swiss arm of Britain’s biggest bank of having helped wealthy customers evade tax. The latest blow to the reputation of the banking industry comes days after the bank was hit with almost £400m of fines for allowing traders to rig foreign exchange markets, . The Belgian authorities said: “The Swiss bank is suspected of having knowingly eased and promoted fiscal fraud by making offshore companies available to certain privileged clients,” the Belgian authorities said. “The damage done to the Belgian state is estimated at hundreds of millions of euros.” HSBC warned at its interim results in August that it had been informed that “magistrates in Belgium and France are conducting inquiries regarding whether HSBC Private Bank Suisse SA acted appropriately in relation to certain customers who had Belgian and French tax reporting requirements, respectively”. After the announcement by the Belgian prosecutors, HSBC said its Swiss private bank “has been notified that it has been placed under formal investigation by a Belgian judge who, along with the French authorities, is examining whether the bank acted appropriately in the past in relation to certain clients who had Belgian tax-reporting requirements”. HSBC added: “Both the Belgian and French investigations have been notified in our filings previously and we will continue to cooperate to the fullest extent possible.” The case relates to a former employee, Herve Falciani, who faces allegations that he stole information about the bank’s clients which has become known as the Lagarde list, named after , who was finance minister of France and is now head of the International Monetary Fund.
640	641	Google Android 4.4 'Kitkat': seven things you need to know 	Google unwrapped a brand new version of its mobile software on 31 October called , featuring an always listening intelligent search and more. With 4.4 Kitkat Google has improved Android’s performance, added new features and services, as well as integrated new software to support the potential for innovative new uses. Since its inception, has used both an increasing numeric value, like Android 4.4, as well as names taken from famous confectionary. It started with Android 1.5 “Cupcake”, and continued through the alphabet via Android 1.6 “Donut”, Android 2.0 “Eclair”, Android 2.2 “Froyo” (frozen yoghurt), Android 2.3 “Gingerbread”, Android 3.0 “Honeycomb”, Android 4.0 “Ice Cream Sandwich” and most recently Android 4.1 “Jelly Bean”. It was long-rumoured that the follow up to Jelly Bean would be “Key Lime Pie”, however in a deal with Nestle, Google named Android 4.4 after the Kitkat chocolate biscuit. Google’s intelligent digital assistant and smart search, Google Now, has been given much larger prominence within Android 4.4 Kitkat, integrating an always listening feature, which will instantly respond to voice commands triggered by the phrase “OK Google”. Instead of having to launch a separate app, your searches can be made directly from the homescreen without having to tap any buttons, just by starting your commands with “OK Google”. This always-listening feature was first introduced with Google’s smart glasses Google Glass, which is voice-activated by the phrase “OK Glass”. Google has taken steps with Android 4.4 Kitkat to make the experience of using apps like ebook readers or web browsers a much more immersive experience. It has changed the way the system-level interface elements are presented, including the status bar at the top of the screen and the Android menu buttons at the bottom. Instead of permanently bracketing your screen with two black bars, the top notification bar is now transparent, allowing more of your homescreen wallpaper to shine through. The menu bar at the bottom of the screen can now also disappear when an app is put into a full-screen mode, allowing content to take up the full real estate of the screen. Dragging your finger down from the top of the screen or up from the bottom of the screen now reveals the notification or menu bars when in full screen applications. Android fragmentation has been a big problem for app developers ever since the operating system’s inception. Essentially it means that multiple versions of Android that aren’t up to date exist on various devices. While that’s not an issue in and of itself, for developers it presents a massive challenge as they have to programme their apps to support multiple versions of Android – all with differing capabilities. Google has already taken steps towards minimising fragmentation through the decoupling of its own applications and services from the operating system into separate downloadable apps. That allows users on older versions of Android to update these apps separately through the Google Play store and gain access to the new services and features. Now Google is taking its battle with fragmentation a step further by reducing the system requirements for Android 4.4 Kitkat. In doing this Google has made it possible to run Kitkat on much lower power devices. Following Apple’s lead with the , Kitkat also features support for low power sensors using a process called “hardware sensor batching”. Essentially, Android will now queue up sensory input to be processed in batches, which means that the central processor doesn’t need to be in a high-power state all the time to accept and process data from the phone’s sensors like the GPS, accelerometers and gyroscopes. The end result is much improved battery life, while maintaining the data logging and sensory activities that facilitate great features like Google Now, fitness trackers and location reporting. Google has also taken steps to simplify and hopefully accelerate the use of near-field communication (NFC) for payments. A significant proportion of Android phones come with an NFC chip built in, which is currently mainly used for pairing accessories and Bluetooth devices. Now Google has baked a new feature into Android Kitkat that aims to simplify the use of NFC applications for payments called “Host Card Emulation”, which facilitates the connection between the applications and the NFC hardware within the Android device. Google hopes that this new simplification within the Android software will help NFC payments, as well as other NFC uses gain traction. Following the   and Android 4.4 Kitkat, various manufacturers announced that they would be updating their smartphones with Kitkat. Google announced that previous Nexus devices, including the   smartphone and Nexus 7 and 10 tablet computers would get the update within the coming weeks. HTC also confirmed that it would be updating its HTC One line of devices, including the new One Max phablet to Android 4.4 Kitkat, with the   seeing the update within 90 days. Other smartphone manufacturers are currently looking at the update, although it is known that the Samsung Galaxy Nexus will not get the Kitkat update.
642	643	Financial Conduct Authority chief says increasing fines will not change culture 	"Increasing the level of fines on highly profitable financial institutions will not alter their behaviour, the head of the said on Thursday as he set out his vision for the new regulator. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, also admitted that there was a concern that the situation in Cyprus, where banks have been closed since Friday while the country hammers out details of a €17bn (£14.4bn) bailout, could cause problems elsewhere. Wheatley said higher fines on firms would have no impact unless top management also took responsibility and customers were ready to move their accounts if they were fed up with the behaviour of the firm. ""To be honest, to the banks that make billions of pounds in profits, whatever the level of fine it will get passed on to shareholders."" Raising the level of fines is not going to make firms change ""unless individuals are held to account… and the consumers make a decision themselves that we'd rather bank elsewhere,"" said Wheatley. This week the said it was taking a tougher approach to fines by basing them on stock market value rather than assessments made by the enforcement division. On Cyprus, Wheatley said an initial plan to skim €5.8bn from savers' bank accounts as part of the bailout could hit confidence in the banking system as it may undermine the €100,000 guarantee on deposits across the EU. Cyprus has now backtracked from the idea of putting a levy of 6.75% on deposits between €20,000 and €100,000 and a 9.99% levy on any deposits larger than that. ""From our point of view the confidence in the banking system was very strongly underpinned"" by the guarantee put in place after the 2008 crisis, he said. He saw it as a ""very important principle"". ""It does undermine confidence in the banking system when what people previously thought were insured deposits [appear not to be],"" Wheatley said. The FCA is being spun out of the FSA, which is being disbanded at the end of this month, and will take on the existing investigations into Libor rigging. It will also take care of consumer issues and the conduct of firms, and be responsible for promoting competition. A new divisional head is being recruited. regulation is moving a new body – the Prudential Regulation Authority – inside the Bank of England. Wheatley attempted to set out a different tone to Hector Sants – the former chief executive of the FSA who now works for Barclays – who had previously warned the City to ""be afraid"" of the FSA. ""You won't hear from us the 'be afraid' tone,"" Wheatley said. ""We want to get back to us having a discussion with the CEOs of firms."" Wheatley had previously said that he would ""shoot first, ask questions later"" in dealing with financial products that may not be appropriate for consumers, as the FCA will have the powers to stop banks and financial firms selling products that it has concerns about. Wheatley said that the current payment protection insurance scandal – estimated to have cost the industry £12bn – was a reminder that it was ""better to deal"" with problems early. ""We will be on the front foot when we see things we don't like,"" Wheatley said. Wheatley refused to comment on the near-£40m of bonuses that had been released to nine Barclays staff on Wednesday, shortly after the budget. But said he ""understood the point"" after a year in which Barclays was fined £290m for rigging Libor. Speaking generally, he said: ""It is a problem if rewards are taken that don't bear any relation to the risk that was taken by the institution."" He said the FCA had demanded that bonuses be clawed back from bankers at some institutions. In addition to the potential for contagion in the eurozone, Wheatley said the regulator was also concerned that customers would start to seek out riskier products because interest rates were so low, and that once rates started to rise customers might start to have difficulty repaying loans. John Griffith-Jones, who will be the non-executive chairman of the FCA, said the regulator could make ""a fresh start."" ""Prevention in this industry is much cheaper than a cure,"" he said."
649	650	HSBC files: HMRC had data on misconduct before bank boss made trade minister 	The UK authorities were already in possession of detailed evidence about wrongdoing at HSBC’s Swiss bank when David Cameron made the executive chairman of its parent bank, Stephen Green, a government minister, the Guardian has established. French tax authorities passed leaked Swiss data containing 6,000 British names to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in May 2010. Lord Green’s appointment as a Conservative trade minister in the House of Lords was made public a few months later. Green was executive chairman of the bank group from 2006 to 2010. The bank’s current management now admit serious “compliance and control failures” occurred at the Swiss bank before January 2011 when HSBC’s current chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, took over. is also facing questions about its handling of the leaked Swiss data. Its then head of tax, Dave Hartnett, went on to work for HSBC as a consultant after his retirement two years after the data was handed over. The UK has taken no legal action against the bank despite the evidence in the leaked files of wrongdoing, and only one individual has faced prosecution. In France, HSBC is being prosecuted for what the authorities call organised “money-laundering” while Belgian prosecutors charged the Swiss bank on suspicion of helping clients evade tax using offshore vehicles. France has recovered £188m in taxes and fines from a list of 3,000 clients and Spain has recovered £220m, also from 3,000 clients. The UK, by contrast, has recovered just £135m from a list of 6,000 clients in a series of secret deals that kept names out of the public domain. Many evaders were offered light penalties of only 10% of tax due, plus immunity from prosecution. The Guardian has pieced together a timeline of the material’s journey into possession of the UK authorities. Documents disclose that in early February 2010 news was first passed in confidence, under international tax information-sharing agreements, that the French government had obtained a sensational leak from HSBC’s Swiss bank. The leak had come from HSBC’s IT technician in Geneva, Hervé Falciani, from whom French police seized the incriminating data. France offered to pass on the contents of the so-called “Swiss disc” to HMRC. On 11 February 2010, Hartnett went to see HSBC at its London headquarters, according to his hospitality register. The Guardian asked Hartnett what was said at that meeting about the Swiss leak. He said: “Lunch was sandwiches, fruit juice and water. You will have to ask HMRC for details of what was discussed.” In May 2010, HMRC was handed a reconstructed UK version of the data by the French. But while tax inspectors began ploughing through their evidence at their London headquarters, a change of British government was taking place. Cameron’s Conservative-led coalition came to power. A couple of weeks later, it was reported that Green would step down from his £1.25m-a-year HSBC job, and by August Cameron was reported to have . “In Stephen we will be appointing a minister with a long career as a leading international banker,” the Lib Dem business secretary, Vince Cable, said in a statement issued after the announcement: “One of the few to emerge with credit from the recent financial crisis, and somebody who has set out a powerful philosophy for ethical business.” A source close to Cable said the welcoming remarks on Green referred to HSBC’s position as the sole major UK bank not requiring a bailout in the financial crisis, and to Green’s writings and speeches on ethical business. Contacted by the Guardian on Monday as to his view on his former junior minister in the light of the HSBC revelations, Cable said: “We simply don’t know at present if Lord Green was aware of or condoned these practices.” HSBC now accepts that customers, many of them British, had been taking advantage of the secrecy on offer to set up undeclared Swiss accounts. Yet at HMRC it was decided that prominent British individuals found to be cheating on their taxes would not be prosecuted, a process which would have led to them being named and the facts coming out. Hartnett has defended the secret tax repayment deals. “There was never an intention to deliberately use taxpayer confidentiality to hide the identity of HSBC clients.” Lin Homer, the overall head of HMRC, also defended this non-prosecution approach before the UK’s public accounts committee in 2012, as a cheaper source of revenue. “The important thing is to get the money in,” she said. But the committee which questioned her was unaware of the mountain of evidence that existed of wrongdoing at HSBC itself. Margaret Hodge, the committee chair, said on Monday: “I am no lawyer. But it seems to me absolutely clear that we’ve got an open and shut case of a systemic policy to support hundreds of people in avoiding paying their tax. And I think the tax authorities here in the UK, HMRC, should look to challenging the bank in the courts.” Other European countries have launched prosecutions against individual clients of HSBC’s Swiss bank since being passed the files. In France last year, Arlette Ricci, heir to a perfume fortune, became the first of some 50 clients to be hauled into court, where she denied tax fraud. In Belgium, a score of Antwerp diamond traders were raided and the bank itself was charged. In the US, not only have individual HSBC tax evaders been prosecuted, but in a separate investigation, the bank narrowly avoided the loss of its licence in 2012 for allowing drug cartels to launder millions of dollars through the group’s Mexican division. Assistant attorney general Larry Breuer said a criminal prosecution would have cost too many jobs and destabilised the banking system. . Hartnett retired from HMRC in 2012. Six months later, while the Swiss disc was still under investigation by his old department, he went on the payroll of HSBC itself. He was being hired, the bank said, to advise on its reformed anti money-laundering measures. The watchdog which vets such moves from government jobs into the private sector, the advisory committee on business appointments (ACOBA), was assured, it says, that Hartnett “had official dealings with HSBC over a number of years, but that these contacts were no more significant than the contacts he had with other banks operating in the UK”. Hartnett denies that this version of events was misleading. He said: “I made a detailed application to ACOBA referring specifically to the investigation of customers of HSBC Geneva. My application was reviewed and countersigned by the HMRC chief executive.” He adds it was “HMRC’s chairman who took an interest in the work of the Enforcement and Compliance directorate. I did not then, or at any other time, get involved in decisions about HSBC investigations. You are therefore wrong to associate me with accountability for performance in this area.” HMRC’s chairman at the time was a business outsider, Mike Clasper, the former chief executive of airports operator BAA. He did not respond to requests for comment.
654	655	Banks fined record £2bn over foreign exchange rigging 	The corruption of the world’s biggest currency dealers has been laid bare with regulators imposing fines of £2bn on five major banks for rigging the £3.5tn a day foreign exchange markets. said they had found for a “free for all culture” rife on their trading floors that has allowed the markets to be rigged for five years. The much-anticipated record settlement with US and UK regulators did not include Barclays, which remains in discussions with other regulators. Each of the fines imposed on Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan and UBS were records for the , smashing the penalties imposed over the past two years for Libor rigging. The chancellor, George Osborne, said: “Today we take tough action to clean up corruption by a few so that we have a financial system that works for everyone. It’s part of a long term plan that is fixing what went wrong in Britain’s banks and our economy.” Osborne will take a share of the fines for the Treasury and said they would be “-used for the wider public good.” Announcing the first ever coordinated regulatory action, the FCA’s Tracy McDermott said: “Firms could have been in no doubt, especially after Libor, that failing to take steps to tackle the consequences of a free for all culture on their trading floors was unacceptable”. The settlement was co-ordinated with the US regulator, the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission, which published transcripts of discussions with traders discussing foreign exchange rates. In one, a trader writes “dont want other numpty’s in mkt to know” and making remarks such as “nice job mate” and “yeah baby” as they discussed foreign exchange rates. Traders at different banks formed tight-knit groups in which information was shared about client activity, including using code names to identify clients without naming them. These groups were described as, for example, “the players”, “the 3 musketeers”, “1 team, 1 dream”, “a co-operative” and “the A-team”. Martin Wheatley, boss of the FCA, said the regulator would “not tolerate conduct which imperils market integrity or the wider UK financial system”. He said: “Firms must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits or leave the ethics of their conduct to compliance to worry about”. “Senior management commitments to change need to become a reality in every area of their business,” said Wheatley. The Bank of England also published its report into whether its officials knew about the behaviour of traders. It concluded that there was no evidence that any official was involved in unlawful or improper behaviour but said there as an error of judgment by one official who knew that bank traders were sharing information.
661	662	Sony Smartwatch 2 review: a second screen for your Android phone 	he Sony Smartwatch 2 is the third iteration of Sony’s smartwatch platform that acts as a second screen for almost any 4.0 smartphone.  With its upgraded interface, slim hardware and waterproof body, has improved its smartwatch in almost all areas, while maintaining its functionality as a solid timepiece. The Sony Smartwatch 2 strikes a fine line between looking like a nerdy gadget on your wrist and resembling a regular watch. It is square, but as its aluminium body is only 9mm thick it is not that much chunkier than an oversized watch and will fit comfortably under a shirt cuff. Following the lead of recent Sony smartphones such as the Xperia Z and Z Ultra, the Smartwatch 2 is waterproof with an IP 57 rating, which means it is watertight at up to 1m deep for 30 minutes. In reality that means you can wear it day to day without having to worry about getting it wet while washing your hands or running through the British downpours, as long as you’ve ensured the micro USB protective cover is properly closed. Sony sells the Smartwatch 2 with black rubber strap; however, it also offers a range of coloured rubber and leather straps. The Smartwatch 2 also uses a standard 24mm watchstrap fitting, meaning you can customise the strap with one of your own and aren’t tied to Sony’s options. The top of the device is dominated by a 1.6in transflective touchscreen LCD which – unlike most LCD displays currently in use – allows you to see the display without a backlight by reflecting ambient light. That means the Smartwatch 2 has a persistent, readable display that shows a watch face by default and makes it very easy to use the smartwatch to actually tell the time, something that’s important if you’re replacing a regular watch with it. Unfortunately the display is decidedly low resolution, which means text from notifications, as well as pictures and even the watch faces, look pixelated at times. The screen is something you can and do get used to, but compared to the high-resolution, pixel perfect screens of most smartphones today, it has noticeably lower fidelity. Pairing and setup of the Smartwatch 2 is pretty straightforward using NFC and Bluetooth – one tap of an NFC-equipped phone and the software takes care of the rest, prompting you to download any software you need from the Google Play store. For those using an Android phone without NFC – any phone with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and up with Bluetooth will work with the Smartwatch 2 – you simply have to pair the phone and watch via Bluetooth. Sony has given the Smartwatch 2 a low power, single-core processor in an effort to balance battery life with the physical size of the device. Processor power is always a trade-off, and for the most part Sony’s Smartwatch 2 performs well enough. Unfortunately that doesn’t mean the experience completely lag free. Battery life is relatively good, and I got a good four days of usage out of the Smartwatch 2 with quite a few alerts and apps running. You would probably need to charge it once every three days to be on the safe side, but a full charge takes about an hour. The Smartwatch 2 runs a bespoke variant of Android, which resembles the regular platform with a homescreen full of app icons and the usual Home, Back and Options buttons below the screen. There’s even a slide-down notifications tray, just like Android on a smartphone or tablet, which is where the lag creeps in. The Smartwatch 2 can hang when a notification is being accessed, failing to respond to taps and swipes for a second or so. It’s not every time, and seems to be linked to the watch’s Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, but it can be annoying. The watch vibrates to notify you of incoming actions, including phone calls which pop up and allow you to dismiss or answer them, if you have a Bluetooth headset connected – there are no speakers or microphone hidden within the Smartwatch 2. Navigating the interface is relatively intuitive using swipes and taps, which again resembles the way an Android phone or tablet is operated. A long tap brings up an options menu, which is unique to the particular app that’s currently in use. Often that can be a bit confusing, as some apps allow you to clear notifications, and others, such as the Twitter app, allow you to, for example, retweet. Speaking of the Twitter app, out of the box the SmartWatch 2 comes with limited functionality, offering built-in apps that allow you to set timers or alarms. Everything else needs to be installed from the Sony SmartConnect app, which handles the management of the smartwatch and is available for free in the Google Play store. Sony has produced apps for handling calls, reading text messages, email, Facebook and Twitter updates, as well as calendar alerts, photos and music control. Beyond that, users are reliant on existing Smartwatch apps, available from previous iterations of the Sony platform, which kicked off with the LiveView in 2010. Three years later there are about 300 apps available for the Smartwatch 2. Unfortunately, it would be unfair to say there’s an app for everything – there is no app for handling Google Hangouts for instance – but developers are actively producing apps for services such as WhatsApp. The Smartwatch 2 starts at £149, which comes with the standard black silicon rubber strap and a Runtastic Pro application. The Sony Smartwatch 2 is more of a second screen for your Android smartphone than a true smartwatch. It has very limited functionality without being paired with a phone. It does, however, function very well as a timepiece, which some other smartwatches certainly don't, and it is readable in any lighting conditions thanks to its transflective display. Sony has managed to foster a relatively large third-party app collection for its Smartwatch range, which bolsters its functionality significantly. Sony says the Smartwatch 2 is a work in progress, and it is actively listening to customer feedback and updating the watch with new software and features.  Twitter notifications are handy, as well as having access to your text messages or email on your wrist, but the Smartwatch 2’s low-resolution screen, limited functionality beyond notifications and £150 price make it more of a novelty than a must-have item. Having said that, if you're after a smartwatch that works with any Android phone with version 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and above, then the Smartwatch 2 is arguably your best option right now.
665	666	Printeer: why you may be buying your kids a 3D printer this Christmas 	"3D printers certainly aren't toys, but one US company is preparing to launch a 3D printer for children called . Mission Street Manufacturing is to get the project off the ground, with plans to ship the first units by October this year. The printer will have a companion app for Apple's , which children will use to create 3D designs that they can then print out. Printeer uses PLA plastic filament for the printing, which the company says is non-toxic. ""In a digital age, when technology skills are some of the most important a child can learn, is there a way to bridge the gap between the screen and the physical world?"" explains Printeer's pitch. ""Now there is. is tailor-made for today's curious, tech-savvy kids. And that's why we've made Printeer."" Mission Street Manufacturing says it is already working with schools in its native California to test its new device, with hopes of persuading more to buy units when it goes on sale. For now, parents and teachers can pay $549 to secure a device from the first production run. This being Kickstarter, there are also options to pay more: $999 for a Printeer customised with their name and choice of colour; $1,499 for a bundle of three; and $2,999 to travel to the company's office to build their own model. ""We aim to bring 3D printing to kids and schools across the globe. We are also committed to smart, sustainable growth,"" explains the company in its pitch. ""This is why we plan to make our first production run right here in our garage, where we can maintain a tight feedback loop between engineering and manufacturing. We sleep fifty feet from our production line."" Printeer is the first 3D printer targeted specifically at kids, although , manufacturer 3D Systems' Cube3 printer has been marketed as a device that's accessible to children as well as adults. There have been several children's apps released in recent months that are designed to work with 3D printers, however. enables kids to design Minecraft-style objects then print them out, while does the same thing for monster figurines.

666	667	HSBC warns of economic risks of UK pulling out of Europe 	HSBC Britain’s biggest bank, has issued a stark warning about the economic risks of the UK pulling out of the as it revealed it was considering moving its headquarters out of London. The unexpected announcement of a full-blown review into where the bank should base its operations, just two week before the general election, was seized on by politicians on the campaign trail. said “regulatory and structural reforms” in the wake of the banking crisis had led to the decision. The chairman, Douglas Flint, also highlighted the economic uncertainty created by the risk of the UK leaving – a blow to the Conservatives, who have pledged to hold an “in-out” referendum on the EU if they win the general election. HSBC has been hit hard the banking levy, which last year cost it $1.1bn (£730m), up from $200m in 2013. Flint denied playing politics, adding the board only decided to launch the review on Thursday after pressure from shareholders. “How other people interpret it is up to them,” he told reporters after the annual shareholders’ meeting on Friday. Its shares jumped over 3% after the statement. The rise added almost £4bn to the value of HSBC – already one of the most valuable companies on the London stock market. Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said the warning over EU membership showed that the Conservatives were irresponsible in “playing fast and loose with the UK’s membership of the EU”. He said the bank would be expected to take account of the wider regulatory context when deciding where to base its business but the warning about the EU was a new dimension. The chancellor, George Osborne, said banks needed to be “properly regulated” but added that Labour’s policies would drive businesses overseas. “If we proceed in this country with an anti-business set of policies we are going to drive companies abroad, we are going to see jobs lost,” he said. The HSBC board – under fire after leaks of the tax avoidance strategies used in its Swiss arm – took the decision on Thursday night after returning from an informal meeting of investors in Hong Kong, its base until 1992. Shareholder after shareholder had asked whether London was the correct home for the bank. Flint said: “I said at our informal meeting in Hong Kong on Monday, we are beginning to see the final shape of regulation and of structural reform, including the requirement to ring fence in the UK. “As part of the broader strategic review taking place, the board has therefore now asked management to commence work to look at where the best place is for HSBC to be headquartered in this new environment. The question is a complex one, and it is too soon to say how long this will take or what the conclusion will be; but the work is under way.” The bank usually conducts a review of its head office location every three years. But the last one was in 2010 and it has not conducted one since because of the regulatory reforms imposed on banks after the 2008 financial crisis. This included the reforms to ringfence high street operations from investment banking arms – the Vickers reforms – and George Osborne’s bank levy. Flint added: “One economic uncertainty stands out, that of continuing UK membership of the EU. In February we published a major research study which concluded that working to complete the single market in services and reforming the EU to make it more competitive were far less risky than going it alone, given the importance of EU markets to British trade.” At the packed meeting Sir Simon Robertson, the deputy chairman, was forced to defend Flint and the chief executive Stuart Gulliver. “I want to make it absolutely clear the board has full confidence in both Douglas and Stuart and the rest of the management team.” But shareholders registered their disapproval, with almost a quarter of them voting against the bank’s remuneration report. On the head office move, one shareholder asked: “Which country are you likely to go to? How many countries have you not committed illegal behaviour in?” The bank employs 166,000 worldwide and about 48,000 are estimated to be in the UK, where HSBC moved its head office after the takeover of Midland Bank in 1992. Unions called for an urgent meeting to discuss the possible implications for staff. Flint also apologised for the scandals to hit the bank: “I and my colleagues understand your disillusionment, share your frustration at having been let down, apologise for the inadequacies in controls that allowed unacceptable behaviours to occur undetected and accept responsibility for restoring HSBC’s reputation and standing to where they should be.” Flint has been on the board since 1995 and is facing scrutiny along with other directors about the activities in HSBC’s Swiss banking arm between 2005 and 2007. Leaked account details showed how customers had been helped to avoid paying tax. This came after the bank was fined £1.1bn from the US authorities for money laundering offences. Flint said: “HSBC has paid a heavy price. Our reputation has been damaged and the financial burden of the unacceptable behaviour has been borne by you, our shareholders in fines, penalties, additional costs and the opportunity costs arising from diversion of management time - this is clearly wrong. “As new regulation which will clarify individual responsibility is embedded and fresh legislation comes into force that will widen the sanctions available to address the most egregious behaviour, I hope we will see much greater individual accountability visited on those directly responsible.” Asked about HSBC, the prime minister, David Cameron said: “London is the world’s leading financial centre [and] has improved as a financial centre not least by changing the way we regulate banks so that we wouldn’t have to bail them out with taxpayers’ money in future as the last Labour government had to do. “But it is an important reminder of how vital it is that we keep a pro enterprise, pro business, pro employment policy in our country. We need to keep taxes low, make this an attractive place to invest. All the time I have been Prime Minister that is what we have been doing, [with] record levels of inward investment coming here.”
672	673	Google introduces the biggest algorithm change in three years 	"Marking Google's 15th birthday, Hummingbird is the of the world's most popular search engine since , which sped up Google's indexing of sites and delivery of search results. The Hummingbird update focuses more on – an encyclopaedia of about 570m concepts and relationships that allows Google to anticipate facts and figures you might want to know about your search term. Hummingbird isn't an overhaul that search users will instantly notice, however. ""In general, Hummingbird – Google says – is a new engine built on both existing and new parts, organised in a way to especially serve the search demands of today, rather than one created for the needs of 10 years ago, with the technologies back then,"" said Danny Sullivan of the search blog  . It will benefit those using more modern forms of search, such as , where you ask Google a question rather than typing keywords into the search box. ""The goal is that pages matching the meaning do better, rather than pages matching just a few words. ""Google said that Hummingbird is paying more attention to each word in a query, ensuring that the whole query – the whole sentence or conversation or meaning – is taken into account, rather than particular words,"" said Sullivan. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to do before and after comparisons, especially as Google has pushed out the Hummingbird update over the last month without any public announcements. For the moment we only have Google's word that Hummingbird will make a difference, although it gave a few examples of searches that could benefit from the new algorithm. For instance, a search for ""acid reflux prescription"" pre-Hummingbird produced sites with lists of drugs, but now brings up search results with more information about acid reflux treatment in general. Likewise, a search for ""pizza hut calories per slice"" now links the answer directly from Pizza Hut. “Apps are the biggest long-term threat to Google’s current search-based business model – people turn to apps for information on discrete services like flights rather than search,” said Ian Maude, a search analyst at Enders Analysis. – Google’s personal digital assistant that uses context, location and knowledge of the user’s habits to preempt requests for information like flights, your daily commute and film times – has been one of Google’s attempts to fight the silos of individual apps and keep you within the Google search ecosystem. That all helps Google maintain its estimated 53% market share of internet advertising. Google Now relies on Knowledge Graph, as well as natural language interpretation, which were both boosted by the Hummingbird update. “Hummingbird doesn’t replace keyword search, it augments it, speeding up the process of search using natural language processes that understands conversational search or speech – it’s a smart move, but there’s clearly a long way to go. “Right now, when I search for trains to Warwickshire, I get a list of search results for train operator websites, but I don’t yet get times for the next trains pulled into fact boxes by Google,” said Maude. Not everything is so straightforward in Google land, as Google's chat protocols Hangouts and Talk, suffered a that saw instant messages routed to unintended recipients."
677	678	iPhone 5S – first impressions 	"So, Apple has unveiled its latest flagship smartphone, the iPhone 5S. Sporting a fingerprint sensor and an improved camera, while being up to twice as fast as the previous generation, the looks to be another stellar smartphone entry. The iPhone 5S starts at £549 ($649) for a model with 16GB of storage, with prices going up from there, through £629 ($749) for 32GB, and hitting a hefty £709 ($849) for 64GB of storage. Compared with last year's 5, the starting price is £20 higher, and makes it more expensive than competition from the likes of HTC (HTC One: £450 for 32GB), Samsung (Galaxy S4 16GB £432, 32GB £525) though not Sony (Experia Z1 16GB £599). Prices on-contract, directly from mobile phone operators, will be slightly lower when taken out with relatively expensive monthly plans. For the iPhone 5S, Apple has improved the camera compared to previous iPhones by physically increasing the size of the image sensor. That should mean significantly higher low-light performance, which should result in better pictures captured in the often-poor lighting conditions users find themselves in. also showed off a dual-colour LED flash, which monitors the prevailing light and tries to provide a better colour mix by providing the right mixture of lights (more yellow or more blue, depending on the conditions). Notably, neither the HTC One nor Samsung Galaxy S4 has this. Party photos from bars, pubs and dimly-lit homes should be clearer, sharper, and with better colours compared to pictures captured by the iPhone 5 and 4S. The 5S also offers ""burst mode"" for the still camera (taking 10 shots per second), and a ""slo-mo"" option for video recording. In burst mode, you hold the button down and it will take the pictures - and then present the single shot it thinks is the best from the series. (You can still choose from among the set, and keep as many as you want.) With the video, you can choose which parts are slow and which are fast in a simple editing function. Expect to see plenty of this on YouTube, Vine and Instagram in the near future. The iPhone 5S marks Apple's first introduction of a fingerprint reader called ""Touch ID"". The sensor sits under the traditional home button, allowing users to unlock their iPhones just by holding their finger on the home button. It's a major leap forward in both phone security and usability, because users will not have to use PINs or passwords. Touch ID will also allow the user to purchase music, apps and videos from Apple's iTunes Store on the phone. Five fingerprints can be stored on the device to unlock the iPhone but do not all have to be associated with your iTunes account. Your kids could thus have a fingerprint to unlock your phone, but not to buy apps, videos and music, which could save you from some very expensive bills. Apple says your fingerprint data - in a coded form which is not a picture of your print - is only stored on your phone, and it isn't sent over the internet or stored on Apple's servers. While Apple has barely changed the design of the iPhone 5S compared with last year's iPhone 5 – maintaining its pin-sharp 4-inch retina screen and thin and light body – it is available in a new colour: gold. The traditional black (rebranded as ""space grey"") and white (""silver"") colours are still available, however. iOS 7, a complete redesign of Apple's mobile operating system, is also launching with the iPhone 5S. It aims to revitalise iOS, which has essentially used the same design language since its introduction in 2007, and has taken the approach of ""flat"" yet colourful design. Improvements are available across the board for all of Apple's built-in apps such as Mail, iMessages, Calendar and Photos. It's worth noting that the iOS 7 update will also be available for existing iPhones, including the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5. (Owners of the original iPad or iPhone 3GS are out of luck.) Apple has kitted out the iPhone 5S with its latest processor. The Apple A7 combines a new 64-bit architecture with improved processing capabilities, which it says will result in a doubling of the speed of the phone compared with the iPhone 5. Coupled to the new A7 processor is a new co-processor called the M7. Its job is to collect data from the phone's various sensors, including the GPS and accelerometers. It can process that data without the main A7 chip. That could be used for monitoring health or movement data without waking the heftier chip, thus saving energy. Apple claims that the iPhone 5S gets equal or better battery life than the iPhone 5 and earlier generations for everything but standby time (where the iPhone 4 claimed up to 300 hours' standby time - 12 and a half days - against 250 hours, or 10.4 days, for the new models). It claims 10 hours' 3G talk time (against 8 previously), 10 hours' LTE browsing (8 previously), and 3G, Wi-Fi, video and music playback unchanged at 8, 10, 10 and 40 hours respectively. Real-life battery usage will, of course, vary. With the inclusion in a mass-market phone of a fingerprint sensor, Apple could potentially remove the need for constant use of passwords, and truly enhance the mobile user experience. Internally, the addition of the M7, shift to 64-bit processing, and inclusion of many more LTE bands while also improving battery life is important too. Yet you would be pushed to tell the difference between them from a quick visual inspection. Of course, the internal parts have been upgraded, and the new camera system could make a real difference to your photos. aren't all about internal specifications, and are much more about experiences, which is something Apple is very good at delivering. Combined with the new iOS 7, the iPhone 5S should be very good indeed. This article was initially published with the headline 'iPhone 5S – review' but this has been corrected. Other corrections have also been made in the text."
692	693	How would fingerprint technology benefit iPhone 5S users? 	"Reports from factory production lines and leaked parts indicate that . But what exactly can a fingerprint sensor do for the average consumer? A fingerprint reader or sensor does what it says on the tin – it scans your fingerprint and matches it to a pre-defined image of your finger. Since every fingerprint is unique, the system can then securely verify your identity. A type of image capture system specialised for quickly capturing and storing the imprint of your finger will be embedded below a swipe panel – in this case possibly below the home button on the iPhone 5S – which the user runs their finger over. The sensor captures the image and software analyses it for the skin indentation pattern on your fingertip, comparing it to a set of pre-stored data and verifying your identity. , the sensor will implement an RF sensing system that will not only accurately capture the ridges of your finger, but also image the live skin below the surface of your fingertip to prevent spoofing of the system with a Mission Impossible-style fake fingerprint. Potentially, fingerprint readers could sound the death knell for passwords. The multi-character password is a failing piece of security, given that pretty much any password can be cracked by high-powered computers these days, regardless of how long or complex it is. Two-factor authentication, where another piece of the security puzzle, such as a secret code or key, is used to strengthen simple password logins is currently the best system on offer to consumers. In theory, fingerprint scanners could allow users to completely remove the need for passwords, securely logging into their phones, and enabling higher security functions, which would be particularly useful for online banking and shopping without the need for two-factor authentication. A built-in fingerprint scanner could also make the more amenable to big business for security reasons, although in reality, according to Matthew Finnie, CTO at Interoute, the owner operator of Europe's largest cloud services platform, ""the smartphone is now intrinsic to how people work, so it's time for businesses to change"". ""Rather than focusing on the security merits and nuances of the devices, attention should shift to how businesses should secure and control corporate data and make relevant parts securely accessible from anything, anywhere."" Fingerprint scanners in the past have been a bit hit and miss. The technology, although relatively established in industry and enterprise settings, has never really been available to the mass market consumer or on anything other than secure laptops. That's generally because it has been a frustrating experience for the end user. If manages to make the process of secure login via an in-built fingerprint sensor a smooth and seamless experience, it could revolutionise the way consumers use their phones and bring about faster, more secure platforms for developers to expand upon. However, there have been rumours that the sensor Apple is expected to build into its next iPhone flagship has a limited use lifetime. For example, a rumoured 500-scan limit ""could be used up in only six months, based on users accessing multiple accounts three times a day. This would render the scanner useless for the remainder of a typical mobile phone contract, potentially 18 months,"" according to research by David Webber, managing director of Intelligent Environment, a specialist in the financial security field. If a consumer keeps their smartphone for two years, as is the length of many mobile phone contracts currently, there is a possibility that the fingerprint sensor could fail, or cease to work leaving users stranded without access to secure logins for their phone, banking or shopping. Biometric authentication, where a unique part of your body's function is used to verify your identity, is a growing field. Many different factors can be used to securely identify the consumer. Iris scanners were once hailed as the holy grail of identification, but the technology required to scan an iris accurately is both expensive and often bulky – not something suitable for phones yet. Recently the unique rhythm of individual heartbeats has been pushed forward as another tool in the biometric armoury, with a bracelet such as the that monitors your pulse on your wrist, which would offer a much more realistic and consumer-friendly entry into biometric security."
693	694	iOS 7 download delays frustrate Apple customers 	"There have been widespread complaints from users about the latest software for iPhones and iPads amid lengthy delays in downloading the new features. Customers took to Twitter to complain about problems in downloading iOS 7 on to their mobile devices after the update came online at 6pm BST. The new operating system overhauls the look of iPhones and iPads and brings in a number of new navigation features – the biggest change in the look of the software since the iPhone was launched in 2007. Some users claimed the download – which required a Wi-Fi signal – was taking a number of hours to complete. ""iOS8 will be available by time iOS7 finish updating,"" said one user, DJ Melo. Elle Lake (lizzylake) said: ""43 minutes remaining to download iOS 7.0 but now 10 minutes later there is an error, and I have to upload it again with another 2 hour wait"". Many found they were unable to download the new software at all, instead getting error messages on their screen. Sam Allison, tweeting under VF2010, responded to the problem saying: ""Guess I'm not the only one getting an Error message trying to Download IOS 7.0 £Annoying"". Conor Rickards, using the handle cajr, opted for irony, tweeting: ""Having a great time using IOS 7.0"" whilst posting a picture of the error message. The new system, which includes fresh camera functions and a streaming radio feature, was unveiled at the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco in June. It has been designed to make the iPhone appear bigger, with features crafted to take advantage of the entire screen. Text is said to appear sharper, while a ""control centre"" on the phone allows users to adjust settings with just one swipe from the bottom of the screen. Apple did not respond to calls about the matter."
695	696	Google and the future of search: Amit Singhal and the Knowledge Graph 	"hinking about Google over the last week, I have fallen into the typically procrastinatory habit of every so often typing the words ""what is"" or ""what"" or ""wha"" into the search box at the top right of my computer screen. Those prompts are all the omnipotent engine needs to inform me of the current instant top 10 of the virtual world's most urgent desires. At the time of typing, this list reads, in descending order: What is the fiscal cliff What is my ip What is obamacare What is love What is gluten What is instagram What does yolo mean What is the illuminati What is a good credit score What is lupus It is a list that indicates anxieties, not least the ways in which we are restlessly fixated with our money, our bodies and our technology – and paranoid and confused in just about equal measure. A Prince Charles-like desire for the definition of love, in my repetitive experience of the last few days, always seems to come in at No 4 on this list of priorities, though the preoccupations above it and below it tend to shift slightly with the news. The list also supports another truism: that we – the billion components of the collective questioning mind – have got used to asking Google pretty much anything and expecting it to point us to some kind of satisfactory answer. It's long since become the place most of us go for knowledge, possibly even, desperately, for wisdom. And it is already almost inconceivable to imagine how we might have gone about finding the answer to some of these questions only 15 years ago without it – a visit to the library? To a doctor? To Citizens Advice? To a shrink? That was the time, in the prehistory of about 1995, when our ideas of ""search"" still carried the sense of the word's Latin roots – a search was a kind of ""arduous quest"" that invariably involved ""wandering"" and ""seeking"" and ""traversing"". Not any longer. For those who are growing up to search in this millennium, it implies nothing more taxing than typing two words into a box – or, increasingly, mumbling them into a phone – and waiting less than an instant for a comprehensive answer, generally involving texts and images and films and books and maps. Search's sense of questing purpose has already gone the way of other pre-Google concepts, such as ""getting lost"". That rate of change – of how we gather information, how we make connections and think – has been so rapid that it invites a further urgent Google question. Where will search go next? One answer to that question was provided by the billionaire double act of Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google's founders, in 2004, when pressed about their vision of the future by the former journalist Steven Levy. ""Search will be included in people's brains,"" said Page of their ambition. ""When you think about something and don't really know much about it, you will automatically get information."" ""That's true,"" Brin concurred. ""Ultimately I view Google as a way to augment your brain with the knowledge of the world. Right now, you go into your computer and type a phrase, but you can imagine that it could be easier in the future, that you can have just devices you talk into or you can have computers that pay attention to what's going on around them…"" Page, generally the wilder thinker, was adamant, though. ""Eventually, you'll have the implant, where if you think about a fact, it will just tell you the answer."" Nine years on, Brin's vision at least is already reality. In the past couple of years, a great advance in voice-recognition technology has allowed you to talk to search apps – notably on as well as – while , awarded , will tell you what you want to know – traffic conditions, your team's football scores, the weather – before you ask it, based on your location and search history. Page's brain implants remain some way further off, though both Google founders have lately been wearing "" "" prototypes, headbands that project a permanent screen on the edge of your field of vision, with apps – cameras, search, whatever – answerable to voice-activated command. Searching is ever more intimately related to thinking. In this sense, the man who is, these days, in charge of the vast majority of the world's questing and wandering and seeking and traversing is called Amit Singhal. Aged 44, head of Google Search, he is a boyishly enthusiastic presence, who inhabits a much-mythologised office in Mountain View, California, somewhat in the way that the Wizard of Oz lived at one end of the Yellow Brick Road. Singhal is the man who pulls the levers that might just help you find a heart, or a brain, or the way back to Kansas. For a dozen years, he has taken over responsibility from Brin for writing and refining the closely guarded algorithm – more than 200 separate coded equations – that powers Google's endless trawl for answers through pretty much all of history's recorded knowledge. So far, he has never stopped finding ways to make it ever smarter and quicker. To find Singhal, I go through all those by now second-nature travel preparations. I Google a hotel to stay at nearby in Palo Alto, view the options, have a virtual look around a couple before booking. I Google my flight times and check in. I Google a car hire firm, find the cheapest on a comparison site, and choose a car, and hook up to Google maps to plan the route of the 400 or so miles I'll drive from Los Angeles northwards. I Google information about where to park at the Googleplex, and Google the of the walk I will make from the car to the right office building, past the replica outside. I Google a few interviews Singhal has given in the past. And then a day or two later I do it all for real. There is something slightly disconcerting about the Mountain View Googleplex itself, which I guess has a lot to do with finding yourself in the physical space of so virtual an entity. At the end of last year, Google published photographs of its vast and ever-growing data centres for the first time. The images of our cloud of knowing were either inspiring or terrifying, depending on your point of view. Endless banks of servers, linked with primary coloured Google wiring, stretched as far as the eye could imagine, a great outsourced brain thrumming in high-security hangars in Oklahoma, Ohio and Georgia, fed by all the world's anxiety and curiosity. The control centre of that unprecedented storage centre could hardly be more open access, however. You can wander around the sprawling landscaped Googleplex campus or hop on a primary coloured Google bike to cycle between buildings and nobody bothers you at all. The Googleplex was conceived by Brin and Page to encourage geeks to be sociable. It seems to work; it is overpopulated by a chatting and mingling crowd of what seem like quite intense postgrad students who look happy and healthy and are, though you would never quite guess it, often jaw-droppingly rich. The site is full of free cafes, punctuated by volleyball courts; every workspace has pool and table tennis tables; you can visit a doctor or a dentist, get a haircut, get your dry cleaning done, have a massage (Google's masseuse became a stock millionaire), go to the gym. It has book talks, movies and music events – when I visit David Beckham had just been on site as a ""guest speaker"". There are whiteboard walls everywhere full of algebra and in-jokes; there is a learning space with classes in everything from mindfulness to Greek myth. And of course lots of gadgets. In the foyer is a mini wraparound of screens that allows you to key in a postcode and stand in any street in the world. Fittingly, having Googled the way here, now I have arrived I find myself standing outside my house in London again, exactly where I was two days and a transatlantic flight earlier. Google's Mr Search, Amit Singhal, has likewise come a long way to get here. He started out in a village in Uttar Pradesh in India, in a home that for the first eight years of his life possessed no screen at all. When one arrived in 1977, a black-and-white television, it carried for Singhal, he tells me, all the magic of prophecy. ""There were two kinds of programmes,"" he recalls. ""Programming for local farmers and reruns of American series such as ."" You don't really have to think too hard to imagine which of these programmes Singhal chose. ""I watched way too much , to the extent that I could remember episodes by heart,"" he recalls with a laugh, ""and I deeply believe now that shaped my thinking. The fascination with flying through galaxies and talking to a computer that could answer any question was always there for me. But of course I never imagined those problems would begin to be solved in my lifetime at all."" Singhal found himself in any case in the right place at the right time. He started studying the idea of search as a graduate in America in 1991, the year the world wide web began making its connections. He did a PhD and then ended up in the Bell laboratories at AT&T. It was only when he came to Google in the millennium year, however, that he experienced ""a strange kind of discontinuity"". Everything that had seemed like science fiction all his life was suddenly within his compass. To prove that point, Singhal takes his smartphone out of his pocket and, like Captain Kirk, talks into it. ""Google: what is the population of London?"" he says. ""The population of London was 8.174 million in 2011,"" the carefully conversational voice replies. ""How tall is Justin Bieber?"" he wonders. ""Justin Bieber is 5ft 7in tall."" Singhal looks at me with childlike glee. ""If I had gone to sleep 20 years ago and you had woken me up today and I heard that, I would be thinking, yes! And where do I sign up to fly to another galaxy?"" What he is demonstrating, however, he insists, is still just the beginning. Google search is, he says, with evangelical zeal, on the threshold of another epochal change in its fast-forward evolution. Having searched for a decade or so using the original brilliant principle of hierarchies of web-based links, the great primary coloured knowledge domination machine has, Singhal suggests, ""begun to learn how to understand the real world of people, places and things"". To answer his question about Justin Bieber, Google already has to know quite a lot. It has to know Justin Bieber is a person and that tallness means height. ""So you have already got to get to the semantics of what is being asked. But even that is not enough. Because beyond that there is this huge mass of unstructured text that we know as the web. And you cannot properly understand what was asked for without really understanding how you are going to go about answering it."" Until now, Google has been an unprecedented signposter of knowledge. It has not ""known"" the answer to anything itself but it has had an awfully clever way of directing you to exactly the place you can find out. In some senses, that attribute is in the process of changing. This year, Google will roll out what it calls its , the closest any system has yet come to creating what Tim Berners-Lee, originator of the web itself, called ""the semantic web"", the version that had understanding as well as data, that could itself provide answers, not links to answers. The Knowledge Graph is a database of the 500 million most searched for people, places and things in the Google world. For each one of these things, it has established a deep associative context that makes it more than a string of words or a piece of data. Thus, when you type ""10 Downing Street"" into Google with Knowledge Graph, it responds to that phrase not as any old address but much in the way you or I might respond – with a string of real-world associations, prioritised in order of most frequently asked questions. Five years ago, when wrote his book , which is still the definitive history of the subject, he concluded by imagining a future directly out of Isaac Asimov's science fiction. ""All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected. But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships. A timeless interval was spent doing that."" Knowledge Graph, you might say, is the beginning of that ""timeless interval"". Google has already come closer than anyone could ever have imagined to the ""nothing was left to be collected"" part of that equation. It is in searchable possession not only of the trillions of pages of the world wide web, but it is well on the way to photographing all the world's streets, of scanning all the world's books, of collecting every video uploaded to the public internet, mostly on its own . In recent years, it has been assiduously accumulating as much human voice recording as possible, in all the languages and dialects under the sun, in order to power its translation and voice recognition projects. It is doing the same for face recognition in films and photographs. Not to mention the barely used possibilities of the great mass of information Google possesses regarding the interests and communications and movements and search history of just about everyone with a phone or an internet connection. This data has been collected not just for the purpose of feeding it back to us as accurately as possible, but also for the wider purpose: of teaching Google how to think for itself. Singhal has worked with what he calls ""signals of salience"" for the past dozen years, finding ever more accurate text- and link-based methods of making searches happen. But also, crucially, as these signals have become ever more sophisticated, Singhal and his team have been able to ""observe the whole world interacting with the data, and with that we were able to begin to do something else, which was to begin to make the computer understand the context of what was being asked"". The way in which this is done is quite simple. Search analysis is divided into ""long clicks"" and ""short clicks"". A long click represents a satisfied customer. A user performs a search, clicks through on a result and remains on that site for a long time. They don't come back to the result set immediately to click on another result or to refine their query. A short click is the opposite of a long click. It occurs when a user performs a search, clicks through on a result and quickly comes back to the result set to click on an alternative result. It represents a minor failure. We may think we are learning all the time from Google, but by virtue of this ongoing trillion-click analysis, it is learning far more from us. In this way, as far back as 2002, Singhal introduced a refinement based on Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory on how the meaning of words is always influenced by context. Searches for ambiguous terms began to look beyond the search terms for other related words. So a phrase such as ""hot dog"" would be understood in relation to mustard and baseball games, not overheated canines. ""Nuance,"" he says now, ""is what makes us human."" I imagine, I say, that along the way he has been assisted in this work by the human component. Presumably we have got more precise in our search terms the more we have used Google? He sighs, somewhat wearily. ""Actually,"" he says, ""it works the other way. The more accurate the machine gets, the lazier the questions become. So actually our lives get harder."" He had to work especially hard to correct and understand spelling errors and analyse synonyms. And all along the dream has been the old one of providing the right answer to what you think you want to know even if you don't know quite how to phrase the question. To work like a mind works, in other words. ""The end game of this is we want to make it as natural as possible a thought process,"" he says. ""We are maniacally focusing on the user to reduce every possible friction point between them, their thoughts and the information they want to find."" Getting ever closer to Page's brain implants, in effect. Knowledge Graph is the first real demonstration of that prowess. It started a couple of years ago when, Singhal says, ""We ran into this tiny company called , which had, through a symphony of machines and humans, begun to perfect a system to present real-world people, places and things in a computer memory. The method seemed scalable. So we bought this company."" By that point, Metawab had stored 12 million reference points. Over the last two years, in its characteristic style, Google has quickly accelerated that to ""over 570 million references with 18 billion factual connections between them"". (This is a sizable number: by point of comparison, the English version of Wikipedia has about 4 million pages.) Google is in the process of launching Knowledge Graph in seven languages and aiming to exhibit the same local intelligence in each. Knowledge Graph's project manager is Emily Moxley. She talks me though some of this intelligence. It goes quite a long way beyond being able to distinguish between an English query for football scores and an American one. ""In Japan for example,"" she says, ""our analysis shows that people want to know quite a lot about the blood type of film stars"", so that will be a prioritised part of the instant Knowledge Graph in that part of the world. Likewise, Japanese Googlers seemed short-click frustrated that the search for sumo wrestling data was not as accurate as it might be. ""We worked on rectifying that,"" Moxley says. ""We thought at the very least we should be able to answer a certain depth of queries."" What kind of depth? ""Somewhere at least in the most popular tens of millions,"" she suggests. More than that, Singhal wants to be sure all aspects of the data are properly in harmony with your desires. ""If you wanted to find out about Dr Martin Luther King's 'I have a dream speech',"" he says, ""you might want the text, you might want a picture of him, but we guess that what you really want is a video clip of him delivering the speech – so how to get that to the top of your search."" Again Knowledge Graph can deliver that; it starts to know what you want to know. In talking to Singhal, it is quite easy to get caught up in the utopian possibilities of the technology and quite easy, of course, to forget that Google has also created wealth faster and more efficiently than any company in history; that it is probably the most effective generator of advertising dollars ever invented; and that a great deal of what it knows about us we might well want it not to (an unease that might grow by association now that Facebook has of its own data, one that promises to be even more intimate in its revelation of personal history than Google has ever dared to be). All the Google employees I speak to adopt the same kind of reflexive flinch if you hint at any of this, if you suggest that their motives for all this data gathering, this knowledge sharing, might be anything other than pure. It is the same kind of ""Why wouldn't you trust us?"" flinch that has powered the company's growth through loyalty and that sees it refuse to reveal its own intimate search history even when threatened, as it is currently by the European Union, to prove that it does not artificially weight algorithmic results in favour of its own products and commercial partners. Singhal rejects all of this. He winces when I ask: ""What's in it for Google?"" ""We are a search people,"" he says. ""The thing that motivates me is to build a search engine that will outdo all my previous creations. Simple as that."" Further, he believes, as a statement of faith, ""that all information is empowering"". One of his favourite examples comes from his own family. Every year, Singhal returns to Uttar Pradesh and sees the transformations that the mobile availability of all the world's knowledge has brought. And most years his father comes over to California. ""My dad is a retired civil servant,"" Singhal says, ""and when he visited us he used to worry the whole time about returning home and taking presents through customs where the rules about what you could bring home were very complicated, and changing all the time, and he would get harassed and asked a hundred questions. ""I remember 10 years ago when he was here I showed him how to Google 'Indian custom regulations' and there it all was in black and white, up to the minute. He printed it out and his chest all puffed out. As soon as he got home he called me excitedly to say how he had presented the customs officer with this bit of paper and told him how his gifts for his grandkids complied with the letter of it. To which the customs officer replied, 'Welcome home, Mr Singhal!'"" Singhal could no doubt point to a multitude of such examples. But what about the less measurable ways that the ease of search has changed our lives? I ask. What about the ways in which it has diminished the excitement of serendipity, the way that it has made the personal experience of a chance encounter with knowledge so much rarer? Singhal has been working on that. The Knowledge Graph will still return the results it thinks you most likely need, but down the list it will have a randomised element; it will have chance built into it, another way it might mimic the way we think. His current obsession is in behavioural psychology; he has become an avid student of the work of Daniel Kahneman. ""I just love the way it details how human beings feel when faced with choices and decisions, what makes you run away when someone offers you 32 chocolates to choose from, but which satisfies you when they only give you one chocolate."" How, I wonder, will Google incorporate that knowledge in its unending search? ""I don't know exactly yet…"" Singhal says brightly, leaving you in no doubt of what might be his organisation's guiding mantra: he will soon. Searches the web without filtering results based on previous searches. Google will customise results based on a person's search history, which can give you biased search results (called the ""filter bubble""). Not only does DuckDuckGo burst the filter bubble to give you more results, but it won't remember your previous searches. Unbiased searches, maintaining privacy, finding illicit content. Not a search engine but a ""computational knowledge engine"", Wolfram Alpha can interpret queries and provide concrete factual answers rather than a list of search results. It can also make calculations. It doesn't search web pages but its own store of information covering a number of fields from chemistry to history. Historical facts, mathematical problems, nutritional information, cheating on your crossword. A photo-based search engine that uses metaphors to generate images related to your search. Rather than web results, Yossarian Lives! provides pictures representing related ideas. By clicking the ""Resonance"" button, users can express the usefulness of a particular image to help narrow down results for future searches. Generating ideas. The new, not-yet-released Facebook search feature that will allow users quickly to find content posted to the social networking site by themselves and their friends. For example, ""Italian restaurants in London my friends like"", or ""Friends of friends who are single and live in Ipswich"" would yield specific, personal results. Graph Search will be integrated with search engine Bing (much like Google) to provide answers outside the realm of Facebook. Narrowing down photo searches or holiday recommendations, online dating. Searches Google for you by proxy so you can still use the powerful search engine but results aren't skewed by your search history and your searches will not be tracked.

696	697	Jayne-Anne Gadhia: back to bid again– the woman who wants Virgin tied to a Rock 	"ayne-Anne Gadhia's motto is ""never give up"". Just as well, perhaps, as the Virgin Money boss is accustomed to setbacks – but does not stop to think about them for too long. The imposing and gregarious Midlands-born banker before it was nationalised in February 2008 and then missed out on 318 Royal Bank of Scotland branches last year. She is now ready to do it all again, this time with simultaneous offers for 600 Lloyds Banking Group branches plus Northern Rock. The 49-year-old insists that she does not dwell on past defeats – or on the possibility of further disappointments. ""I move on. I don't dwell [on things],"" she says. The same is true in her personal life. She had six courses of IVF to conceive her daughter, Amy (pictured with her above), when she was 40. She then had another six more before, she says, ""age got the better of me"". ""My motto is never give up,"" she says in a tiny meeting room in the firm's Edinburgh headquarters, complete with what she regards as the best views of the Scottish capital. As she faces the imposing Arthur's Seat, looming over the city, Gadhia – her married name – insists that the takeovers are still her plan B. Plan A is to proceed with the organic growth of Virgin Money, which despite being dubbed a new entrant into the financial markets, began life on 19 December 1994 when the insurer Norwich Union – Gadhia's then employer – signed a deal with Sir Richard Branson's ambitious to launch savings and pensions products. Her aim, since buying the tiny Yeovil-based Church House Trust bank last year to obtain a banking licence, is to open 70 branches, although the first ones are unlikely to open before next year. For now, Virgin will start by opening four lounge-type concepts in Edinburgh, Norwich, Manchester and London by the end of the year. Saving accounts are included in the plan, with current accounts – seen as central to any successful step into banking – planned for 2012, later than rivals had expected. If Virgin can take control of at the second attempt, it would propel her business plan forward by five years. She does not put a figure on the impact of taking on 600 Lloyds branches but calls it ""a once-in-a-generation opportunity to acquire significant and complete banking capabilities"". As she prepares to embark on a roadshow to find £3bn of funding to enter first-stage bids for both Northern Rock and Lloyds, Gadhia is confident that Virgin Money's compound annual growth rate of 36% will be enough to arouse interest. Potential backers have already calling at the Edinburgh office, tucked on a quiet side street, to express an interest in standing alongside the US investor Wilbur Ross, who has already committed £500m to any bids. A move to a larger office is planned for next year. Exuding charm and energy, Gadhia was born in Stourbridge in the Midlands before moving at 13 to Norwich. Her parents, both aged 83, have now followed their only child and live in a house attached to hers in Edinburgh. She says she only ever applied for one job – accountancy training at Ernst & Young – which led her to Norwich Union, where she was involved in signing the deal to create what has become Virgin Money. When bought the hugely successful Virgin One account in 2001, she went with it and ended up running a £70bn mortgage book for RBS until the end of 2006, when the ""cracks were starting to show"". Gadhia left RBS because ""it just made me miserable"". Senior executives – although not the former chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin – wanted her to securitise sub-prime mortgages and make the business more like the soon-to-implode Northern Rock. She sold her shares at £21.98; the taxpayer bought into the bank at 50p, 18 months after her departure. She contrasts the management style of Goodwin and Branson. ""If I'd been bidding for Northern Rock for Fred, he'd have told me every day what he wanted me to do. Richard rings me every night to ask me what he can do to help."" ""Northern Rock one"" – as she calls the first attempt to buy it – is still fresh in her mind. She was swimming in the pool in the Haymarket hotel in London (her preferred place to stay when in the city) when her husband, Ashok, raced to tell her that the then chancellor, Alistair Darling, was on the TV saying Northern Rock was to be nationalised. As far as she was concerned, the Financial Services Authority had approved Virgin's bid and the following day had to apply to the regulator to have the ""change of control"" reversed. Her plea to the new government is, rather than string Virgin along, to come clean and admit if remutualisation of the Newcastle-based lender is the preferred option. ""Then we can focus on Lloyds,"" she says. While she regards mutualisation as a ""fantastic"" concept, she sees plenty of drawbacks. ""We've looked at acquiring a mutual that was subsequently acquired by a mutual. They [the members] would have had a capital payment [from us]. They never knew. I'm not sure how that's in the best interests of members,"" she said. Brandishing images of what Virgin ""lounges"" might look like – similar to a stark yet trendy hotel restaurant – Gadhia admits that her other motto for running the business is ""wanting to make everyone better off"". This is shortened to ""ebo"". ""I always ask: 'Is it ebo?',"" she says when shown ideas about pricing or new products Revealing some of the ideas behind the Virgin Money proposition, she says she wants it to be ""trusted""; but while most bankers would set out that aspiration, she goes on to talk about being ""adventurous"" and adding a ""bit of glamour"". ""We think beautiful, not functional,"" she says. It is a bit like Virgin Atlantic, she adds: aviation is a regulated industry, like banking, but it always ""makes her smile"" when she flies with the airline. She sees the brand as ""feminine"" and the business ""very well balanced"", with 47% of staff female. If either the bid for the Lloyds branches or for Northern Rock are successful – she concedes that Virgin is unlikely to see both through to the final stages – her aim will be to have Virgin Money's brand plastered over the high streets. A stock market flotation is also on the cards. ""It is a necessity,"" she says, as a way to raise capital. She has also realised that a plan she had to retire at 60 – just a decade away – needs to be put on hold. ""I only realised that last week,"" she says. A decade ago, she was hampered by post-natal depression after six weeks' maternity leave from RBS. But now she has found work-life balance: ""What I'm chuffed about is I feel as if I have a life, rather than a home life and a work life."" 16 October 1961 Married to Ashok, one daughter Culford School, Bury St Edmunds; University of London 1982, trainee accountant at Ernst & Young; 1987, joined Norwich Union as an accountant; 1994, joined Virgin Direct as chief operating officer and compliance director; 1998, appointed managing director, Virgin One account; 2001-2006, under Royal Bank of Scotland group, managing director of Virgin One account, First Active, consumer finance and RBS Mortgages (managed mortgage book of £70bn); 2007, named chief executive, Virgin Money"
698	699	Virgin Money buys Northern Rock for £747m 	"The UK government has agreed to sell plc to Virgin Money, nearly four years after nationalising the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The sale, announced on Thursday morning, will raise at least £747m for the Treasury – just half the amount that . The final price could rise to more than £1bn. The deal also means the Northern Rock brand will soon vanish from the high street. George Osborne said the sale was an ""important first step"" in cutting the British taxpayer's shareholding in the banking sector. ""It represents value for money, will increase choice on the high street for customers and safeguards jobs in the north-east,"" the chancellor added. Northern Rock plc is the ""good"" half of the bank, including its branch network, funded by retail deposits. As part of the deal, Virgin Money has agreed to make no compulsory redundancies for at least three years from completion, and to retain the existing branch network. It will also make Newcastle – where Northern Rock was based – its operational headquarters. A series of job cuts have already reduced the bank's workforce to around 2,500 – from close to 6,000 before it was nationalised. Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin, said the deal would create ""a real alternative to high street banks"". He also revealed that Virgin Money had no plans to use the Northern Rock brand, which is likely to be phased out next year. Virgin Money plans to float itself on the stock market in 2014, depending on the state of the financial markets. The Treasury will receive an £80m payment if Virgin Money is either floated or sold within five years. Under the terms of the deal, the government also expects to be paid around £50m six months after the deal is completed. It is also receiving £150m of capital in the merged company. Northern Rock was split at the start of last year. The ""bad bank"", which holds ""toxic"" mortgages, was renamed Northern Rock Asset Management and merged with Bradford and Bingley, another bank that failed to ride out the credit crunch. The sale to Virgin also extinguishes hopes that Northern Rock could be remutualised. It began life as a mutual building society before being floated on the stock exchange in 1997."
703	704	Libor-rigging: two ex-UBS staff face criminal charges 	"The first criminal charges in the Libor scandal were brought on Wednesday for manipulating the key rate and making corrupt payments to brokers. The US authorities are to begin extradition proceedings against two former employees after regulators found the Swiss bank had been involved in ""extensive and widespread"" attempts to manipulate key benchmark interest rates. The £160m portion of the fine levied by the Financial Services Authority is the largest ever imposed by the City regulator, surpassing the £59.5m imposed on Barclays in June for attempted manipulation of the and Euribor rates. The total Barclays fine was £290m, and led to the resignation of chief executive Bob Diamond. The FSA said the UBS offences were ""considerably more serious"", involving payments of £15,000 a quarter to brokers to help fix the rate used on financial products such as mortgages worth £300tn. Just as the Barclays case revealed traders promising each other Bollinger champagne, in helping to fix Libor. An electronic chat described a UBS trader and two traders at two unnamed banks being described as the three ""muscateers"" (sic). In another electronic exchange, a UBS trader says to a broker ""do the bisness and i'll sort you MASSIVE"". Another said he would pay a broker ""whatever you want"" to fix Libor at a suitable level. In Washington, the department of justice said Tom Hayes and Roger Darin, two former UBS employees, had been charged with conspiracy and that Hayes was also charged with wire fraud and an antitrust violation. ""Make no mistake, for UBS traders the manipulation of Libor was about getting rich,"" assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer, the head of the department's criminal division, said. Breuer said the department would seek the extradition of two former employees. ""We believe that one of them is in England. The other one is in Switzerland. Mr Hayes obviously was a very, very major trader, and we're going to continue to move forward,"" he said. In an agreement with the department of justice, the Japanese arm of UBS pleaded guilty to one charge of wire fraud, and is paying US regulators a total of £740m. It is the latest in a string of embarrassments for the City, following the record £1.2bn fine on HSBC for money laundering and £415m penalty levied on Standard Chartered for Iranian sanctions busting. found UBS had made at least 2,000 requests for ""inappropriate submissions"" to the key rates and at least 45 individuals ""including traders, managers and senior managers were involved in, or aware of, the practice of attempting to influence submissions"", the FSA said. It feared every one of those submissions was potentially suspicious. The bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland is in talks with regulators over its involvement in rigging the key rates and at least a dozen firms are co-operating with the authorities. A criminal investigation into Libor has begun in the UK and the Serious Fraud Office arrested three men last week. Sergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS, who joined after the Libor offences, said 30 or 40 people had now left the bank and the ""misconduct"" did not reflect the values of the bank, which had to be bailed out by Switzerland during the 2008 financial crisis when many of the regulatory breaches were taking place. ""We deeply regret this inappropriate and unethical behaviour. No amount of profit is more important than the reputation of this firm and we are committed to doing business with integrity,"" Ermotti said. UBS, in the process of axing 10,000 staff, will report a loss this quarter as a result of the penalties. The FSA said UBS had colluded with interdealer brokers to influence submissions to the yen Libor rate and that corrupt brokerage payments of thousands of pounds a quarter were made to reward brokers for their efforts to manipulate the Libor submissions of other banks on the Libor panel. It said it had found a UBS trader agreeing with a counterpart that he would attempt to manipulate UBS's submissions in ""small drops"" to avoid arousing suspicion. The trader made it clear that he hoped to profit from the manipulation and referred explicitly to his UBS trading positions and the impact of the Japanese Libor rate on those positions. He offered to ""return the favour"" and illicit fees of more than £170,000 were generated for the broker through unnecessary trades. Five internal audits failed to uncover the attempts to manipulate Libor, which took place between 2005 and the end of 2010. The Swiss regulator Finma said most of the requests were made by one trader who worked in Tokyo from 2006 to 2009."
705	706	JP Morgan's $13bn settlement – the record-setting penalty explained 	Again! First, your priorities seem screwed up. You really need to call your mom more often, because there is really just no excuse. Second, this is a whale-free development. This all comes down to JP Morgan paying penalties for everything it did wrong with mortgages during the financial crisis. Some of that was at JP Morgan itself, and most of it was at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, two banks that bought in 2008. , which is the biggest fine a bank has ever paid. It’s a lot, even in terms of a big bank, but there are two reasons that JP Morgan would pay so much. The first is that the bank is getting a bargain compared to what dozens of lawsuits would cost if they kept dragging on, not to mention . The second reason is that JP Morgan can afford it. The bank has revenues of $21bn a year, and over $2tn of assets. In fact, during the three months of negotiations, JP Morgan was initially going to pay $9bn, , and now it’s $13bn. That can only happen because JP Morgan has such deep pockets. No, it’s going to be broken up into buckets. JP Morgan is in trouble with so many different investors and regulators that it was more convenient to lump them together into one “global” settlement. But the profits will be split differently. Well, here’s : “Of the record-breaking $13 billion resolution, $9 billion will be paid to settle federal and state civil claims by various entities related to RMBS. Of that $9 billion, JPMorgan will pay $2 billion as a civil penalty to settle the Justice Department claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), $1.4 billion to settle federal and state securities claims by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), $515.4 million to settle federal and state securities claims by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), $4 billion to settle federal and state claims by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), $298.9 million to settle claims by the State of California, $19.7 million to settle claims by the State of Delaware, $100 million to settle claims by the State of Illinois, $34.4 million to settle claims by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and $613.8 million to settle claims by the State of New York.” Okay, well, roughly $9bn is going to all those agencies and $4bn is going to help homeowners. The FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They do a lot of different things, but the most important is this: Fannie and Freddie are the middlemen between regular consumers who sign up for mortgages and banks. Fannie and Freddie’s main jobs are to keep mortgages affordable for regular people, and they do that by guaranteeing some of the risk that banks take on when they buy mortgages. If you’re interested in the full history – complete with FDR and the New Deal – you . Ever since the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie are wards of the government. The FHFA is their godfather. The FHFA said that JP Morgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual dumped $33bn of bad mortgages on Fannie and Freddie without being clear about how bad the mortgages were. JP Morgan didn’t admit that it misled Fannie and Freddie. It is paying the fine . You’re right in one respect: JP Morgan could have been on the hook for even more. Overall it is paying just about 6.2% of its losses, according to . But, but, but: the key concept here is that JP Morgan didn’t admit wrongdoing. So it’s $33bn worth of allegedly misleading Fannie and Freddie. It’s a kind of official-guilt discount. Welcome to the world of government settlements. Still, it’s a pretty good score for the FHFA. Usually banks don’t pay fines that big for something they can get out of, legally. Yes, about $4bn is going to homeowners. when they were unfairly foreclosed on. The other half, per the New York Times, “JPMorgan has agreed to reduce interest rates on existing loans, offer new loans to low-income home buyers and keep those loans on its books. The bank will also receive credit for demolishing abandoned homes and other efforts focused on curbing urban blight.” The sad part is that, if history is any indication, the impact will be 1) hard to measure and 2) falling short of expectations. Remember the $25bn national settlement with five banks last year? The banks settled charges that they used bad paperwork. So far, those banks have “fulfilled only 80% of their obligations,” to homeowners, . Now, that’s not dire – it means that they’re $15.5bn of the way through on the $19bn they owe homeowners. But the other part of the settlement that was meant for states to distribute to homeowners . Well, one report says $2bn is going to “prosecutors in Sacramento”, according to one account, and another roughly $2bn is going to credit unions in a few states as well as the attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman, and the attorney general of California, Kamala Harris .  Fun fact: it’s actually Sacramento that started all this. The prosecutors in Sacramento were the first to make the case against JP Morgan in August, and then the Justice Department in Washington got wind of it, and then the other regulators piled on. And yes, that’s quite a chunk of change: , which makes the settlement money huge. But that money is really going to the Justice Department, which will likely deposit it with the US Treasury. Yeah. But you know, their salaries come from Washington ultimately, so. It’s pretty easy to understand, actually, even though it has a pompous name: securitization. It’s easiest if you think of apples. When you sign up for a mortgage, it’s like signing up to give your bank a whole apple. It used to be that one bank – the one you signed up for a mortgage from – would hold on to the apple until you paid it off. But if you miss your payments, what happens? That shiny mortgage apple starts rotting. Banks didn’t want rotten apples filling up their vaults, which would create slime and leave no room for fresh, clean apples. So all the banks started bundling the mortgage apples, by throwing them in a barrel together. Then they ran the mortgage apples through a giant slicer and selling buckets of the apple slices to other banks. The benefit of that method of approaching mortgages – the bundling and slicing – is that if any apple pieces rotted, they would be smaller slices and not whole apples. One bad slice wouldn’t ruin the whole basket. But there are drawbacks. For one thing, some banks sold baskets of mortgage apples without making it clear just how many of those slices were getting ready to go bad. That’s mostly what this mortgage settlement is about. The other problem is that once you have these barrels of apple slices, it’s really hard to tell who held all the original apples. So the banks couldn’t follow the paperwork back to your specific apple, because the slices were all over the place. So the banks were just foreclosing on apple slices and hoping they were right. You get the idea. The apple is a mortgage, and you can foreclose on a mortgage – even if you have just a few slices. Sort of. In recent months, the bank has paid $4.5 billion for , $920mn on the London Whale, and $80mn on some . There’s not too much more on the horizon. Maybe little stuff. Totally. But first, call your mom. 
706	707	Facebook Graph Search: Zuckerberg reveals origin of Google privacy rift 	"Facebook doesn't hold many press conferences. But when the world's biggest social network does talk to journalists, the briefings are always best when founder and chief executive goes off script. The 28-year-old did so on Tuesday, , when he openly described a ""wider strategic rift"" with Google and revealed for the first time why negotiations between Facebook and the search giant broke down over privacy. According to Zuckerberg, Google was less willing (or able?) to change its search algorithm so that once a wall post or photograph was deleted from Facebook it vanished from the rival company's search results. Microsoft was able to do this and has . ""Trying to think whether it's reasonable to get into this,"" said Zuckerberg in a Q&A session, prompting a flurry of sudden interest from the assembled journalists. ""I think the main thing is about when people share something on , we want to give them not only the ability to broadcast something out but also change their privacy settings later and take the content down.

The dispute goes back to the ""cold war"" days when Google and Facebook fell out over and, latterly, Google's move into social with Google+. It is significant because, if correct (and Google refuses to comment), it adds to the emerging theory that Google's highly complex search algorithms are increasingly at odds with the social web. Put simply: how would you feel if a photograph you removed from Facebook could still be found by people searching Google? Or an embarrassing Facebook video that appeared in Google searches for your name even though you had been de-tagged on the social network?

That is a problem for Google's brightest brains to address as Facebook and Twitter expand the social web into more areas of our lives."
708	709	Google to build £1bn UK headquarters at London's King's Cross 	 has completed a £1bn property deal to move its UK headquarters to a brownfield site in London's King's Cross area. The US technology giant has purchased a 2.4 acre site between King's Cross and St Pancras stations and plans to build a seven and 11 storey complex due to be complete in 2016. Google already has two central London offices – one in Victoria and one on St Giles High Street – from where staff are expected to be relocated. The move forms part of the regeneration of the King's Cross area following the opening of the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras in 2007. Organisations that have moved into the area since then include Guardian News & Media, publisher of MediaGuardian, and art college Central St Martin's. Google's purchase mirrors its property strategy in Dublin, where it bought a building outright for 2,000 staff in 2011.
716	717	Apple adds new rules on children's apps to iOS developer guidelines 	 has paved the way for the launch of its new Kids category on its App Store by adding new rules for children's apps to its developer guidelines. The newly-added of Apple's App Store Review Guidelines sets out the company's policy on privacy, advertising and use of in-app purchases in iOS apps aimed at children younger than 13. It comes after several months of news stories about children racking up big bills buying virtual items in mobile games without their parents' knowledge, and ahead of the publication this autumn of a . Apple's new guidelines cover four key points: 24.1 Apps primarily intended for use by kids under 13 must include a privacy policy 24.2 Apps primarily intended for use by kids under 13 may not include behavioral advertising (e.g. the advertiser may not serve ads based on the user's activity within the App), and any contextual ads presented in the App must be appropriate for kids 24.3 Apps primarily intended for use by kids under 13 must get parental permission or use a parental gate before allowing the user to link out of the app or engage in commerce 24.4 Apps in the Kids Category must be made specifically for kids ages 5 and under, ages 6-8, or ages 9-11 The rules aren't a huge surprise for children's app developers, with many having added privacy policies and implemented parental gates in their iOS apps in recent months, in response to private feedback from Apple. Apple has not set guidelines on how children's app developers may use analytics tools to gather information on what their young users are doing, although developers in many countries are governed by existing laws in this area – for example, the recently-introduced (COPPA) in the US. Clause 24.4 is interesting for another reason: it sets out how Apple's new Kids category on the App Store will be structured, with the three age buckets. The new category was announced at , and will be introduced on Apple's store as part of its new iOS 7 software this autumn. It will provide a single point of discovery for parents to find apps previously scattered between the Books, Education, Games and Entertainment categories. Apple is currently based in its London office to assist with the curation of the new category. The children's apps market is bustling with activity, from major brand-owners including Disney, the BBC and Nickelodeon to independent firms like Toca Boca and Nosy Crow. A recent report from UK telecoms regulator Ofcom claimed that 91% of parents with a tablet say their children either use it or have one of their own, with 41% saying their kids use the device every day.
723	724	JP Morgan losses bring bank's era of exceptionalism to resounding halt 	The reaper has come for America’s strongest bank. JP Morgan, the bank that sailed elegantly through the financial crisis with no scratches, just announced its . That nine-year winning streak of outrageously good profits is a prize for any bank. But for JP Morgan, that winning streak is over. JP Morgan is showing its mortality as the same plagues that took down its rivals – litigation, regulation, falling profits – finally circle around to the one bank . The lesson is clear: on Wall Street, there are no heroes. Consequences, long delayed, are being visited on the financial sector for its abuses, and JP Morgan’s bad quarter is the first really tangible evidence of that. JP Morgan for the last three months, largely because the bank is taking a hit for a tsunami of mortgage lawsuits and fines that are coming at the bank soon. It has been reported that JP Morgan is facing a for various alleged mortgage abuses committed by two banks it bought during the financial crisis: Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. , the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, met with US attorney general Eric Holder on Thursday and added on Friday that the bank is likely to pay even more in fines and on lawsuits soon, meaning that this loss is the beginning, and not the end. It’s also no real surprise: in 2012, Dimon said a wave of mortgage litigation was coming at the bank. It is a timely lesson for Chase to pay a high price for just as the bank starts a new push into the mortgage market, trying to draw more customers and loosening its lending standards. Chase customers will have found emails declaring “Chase has low mortgage rates! Prequalify today” and promising a cash-back bonus of around $500 every year for the life of a new mortgage if customers have the payment automatically deducted from their banking accounts. JP Morgan is now, like its rivals did long ago, looking for mortgage customers in a bigger way. The fees could be high, but then so could the price the bank may pay again. The new mortgage push and the fine for old mortgage abuses – not committed by JP Morgan, but by the banks it acquired – present a rare moment in financial history. This ends the exceptionalism of , America’s most profitable bank. It shows that banks, as people thought, work pretty much the same: they are commodity businesses, churning out products like loans and mortgages on an assembly line, for slim profit margins. There is no glamor in this work. It is, essentially, a financial utility. The attempts to make it an inordinately profitable business usually means lowering standards, which can backfire in a wave of losses and fines, as they have now. To call JP Morgan a glorified utility is something of a heresy in financial circles. JP Morgan, for years, turned in profits – not just solid profits, but often spectacular ones. It did so with Teflon with ease even as it hurdled obstacles that would have destroyed weaker banks. Consider: in 2009, when rivals like Bank of America and Citigroup were still struggling with government bailouts, a financial crisis hangover and foreclosure headaches, and was blithely boosting the pay of its employees. In 2010, when litigation around the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme was hovering around JP Morgan, the bank earned $17.4bn and , Jamie Dimon, $17.4m in stock. In 2011, when the European debt crisis was wreaking havoc with US and international rivals alike, JP Morgan : clocking in with $19bn for the year and awarding Dimon a bonus of $23m. In 2012, despite the London Whale losses of around $6bn weighing on the bank, it again turned in record – even – profits of $24bn, although to around $11m as a scold for the scandal. During all this time, Citigroup couldn’t even make enough money to get permission from federal regulators in order to pay a simple dividend to its shareholders. has rarely been out of the government’s crosshairs.  In other words, the steady upward march of JP Morgan profits defied history and probability alike. It offered the bank a steely armor of invincibility and created a mythos of exceptionalism. It was foolish to believe in that exceptionalism, both for anyone at the bank and . With this new loss, and the ones that are likely to follow, it’s evident that JP Morgan’s victory lap for the past four years was a significant Wall Street anomaly. Wall Street traditionally moves in lockstep, with similar same profits and losses; if any poppy gets too tall, it doesn’t mean it has found the secret of growth, but only that it has temporarily avoided the reckoning that has to be inevitable. Lehman Brothers, too, was once one of Wall Street’s best success stories. During the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, long considered the two top investment banks in history, came close to staring death in the face. No one is exempt forever. Perhaps this seems dire. But the fact that JP Morgan is conforming to the same troubles the rest of the financial industry has suffered shows that Wall Street is entering a new phase of reckoning. It’s not a sweeping, biblical deluge of consequences, the one called for by Occupy Wall Street and the millions of underwater or foreclosed homeowners. Instead, it’s a slow coming to account. After the financial crisis, large banks survived and even thrived on a variety of government subsidies: direct bank bailouts like Tarp or the Federal Reserve’s series of tireless measures to make lending cheaper. These subsidies – representing “the implicit backing of the government,” as economist  – made it significantly, measurably cheaper for big banks to do business. Small banks resented it, but . Now those subsidies are fading somewhat. (Johnson argues that it’s not nearly enough.) Banks are struggling a little more to make money. JP Morgan’s revenues are not growing as fast as they were. Citigroup has reportedly started of an upcoming 10% dip in its trading revenues because of a rout in bonds.  In addition, the government that once supported these banks is being forced to look out for itself. The Department of Justice and others like the Federal Housing Finance Administration against the banks after years of delays. The result is that banks are being forced to stand on their own, very slowly. At the time, they are being brought to account for mortgage abuses – again, very slowly and in nowhere the kind of scale of the abuses themselves. JP Morgan had a great run, when it could avoid questions by turning in profits. Then 2013 came around. Invincibility ends when profitability does. No longer shielded by a thick armor of record profits, JP Morgan is suddenly truly vulnerable to criticism, which it has muted, . If the bank is wise, it will listen and show both humility and clear evidence of what it plans to change – and those changes, like its fines, should be big.
727	728	3D printers get cheaper, faster - and more mainstream 	" pitches itself as 'the greatest show and tell on earth', a rambling, eccentric, inventive celebration of tech hackers and artists. 3D printing has always been at the heart of this colourful, crafty community, empowering the DIY community to design and build their own artwork and products on 3D printers - and helping the technology edge slowly towards the mainstream. The latest Maker Faire in New York at the weekend saw two of the biggest players show off their new products. Netherlands-based Ultimaker focused on refinement rather than revolution, offering a new model of their flagship printer. Improvements make it easier to use for beginners, with simpler software, a streamlined repository of objects to make and a new printing head which should melt less often. Market leader Makerbot, targeted at the higher end of the chain, showed not a 3D printer but a 3D scanner. The $1,400 (£875) 'Digitizer' can turn physical objects into files compatible with the company’s Replicant line of printers, giving users who lack 3D modelling prowess a way of finding new things to print. The , which was announced by Makerbot in August, will ship in October. The scanner works with the object placed on a central turntable, which then rotates while the Digitizer shines a laser over the entire surface. At the end, it spits out a 3D model in the file format used by the company’s printers. That model is a high resolution scan of the original, containing over 200,000 polygons - the basic building block of all 3D models. But the limitations of the technology mean that not everything can be scanned. (PDF) of trying to scan objects which are “shiny, reflective or fuzzy”, as well as those with a very dark surface colour, since the laser gets absorbed rather than reflected in the right direction. The company also encourages users to manage their expectations, writing that “you will not be able to, for example, scan a hamburger and then eat the digital design"". Ultimaker, the Dutch firm which is Makerbot’s main competitor in Europe, has just launched the €1,895 printer. A refinement of the original Ultimaker, it has the same external dimensions as its predecessor but a larger printing area inside, allowing users to print bigger objects. The company also pushed its online repository of 3D printer files, . As well as the build envelope, Ultimaker has focused on a number of improvements aimed at making it easier to use, including new control software, up to 60 times faster at preparing files for printing and an improved user interface. Improvements were also made to the printer’s extruder, the head which pumps out the molten plastic from which all 3D printed objects are made. Now made almost entirely of metal, it is less likely to melt - a common problem in earlier printers. But the big push is in the online realm. is Ultimaker’s competitor to , the Makerbot-owned repository of 3D printer models. While Thingiverse isn’t specifically limited to designs which work on Makerbot’s printers, Ultimaker is hesitant to rely too strongly on a competitor’s website. Additionally, Youmagine aims to offer an easier workflow for people who just want to print things from their printer. In the works for the Ultimaker 2 is wireless printing, allowing users to click print on the site and watch their printer get to work immediately. But with around 500 designs uploaded, the site has a way to go to tackle Thingiverse. The market leader . Find out how , what's on offer at centre and why in New York."
731	732	MakerBot 3D printing factory opens in New York 	"At a nondescript factory nestled in an industrial Brooklyn waterfront, dozens of tech reporters, industry insiders and 3D printing enthusiasts last Friday filed in to attend the grand opening of the manufacturing headquarters of the best-known name in . MakerBot are touting the new factory as the leader in what CEO Bre Pettis said would be the ""beginning of the next industrial revolution"". That new revolution apparently begins with at-home production of useful missing parts, like shower rings, and glorified tchotchkes, like a trio of inch-tall plastic apples that were on display at the opening. ""The first industrial revolution was all about creating machines and factories where people could go – kind of like here, actually – and work,"" Pettis told the Guardian. ""Now what's interesting is that we've created something that's a factory on your desktop."" Pettis said MakerBot's biggest customers are engineers, industrial designers and architects, who use the printers for personal and professional reasons. Parents, teachers and ""people who like to make things"" have also purchased the printers, he said. Makerbot workers, working. Stopping now to play with things. The company currently sells three iterations of 3D printers which can produce any plastic object users might desire. MakerBot's website has digital designs for more than 100,000 objects, developed by users and available for download by other users. Following the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012, that can be used to produce guns. These designs had always been banned, but are now more stringently enforced with a button that allows users to report inappropriate content. Pettis said this helped remove all plans for guns from the site. ""We make MakerBots with the intention that they'll be used for creative and positive uses,"" Pettis said. ""We are doing our part to make the world we want to live in."" He did not comment on the ability of users to generate designs for deadly weapons without the help of Thingiverse, but experts suggest it is a possibility. The group Defense Distributed posted instructions to make a 3D printed gun online after MakerBot took them down from Thingiverse. The Defense Distributed from posting the instructions after the company's creator successfully fired a gun made on the Stratasys Dimension SST 3D printer in a video. that the Makerbot 3D printers can easily match the thickness of that printer and predicted someone would attempt to make it on a MakerBot printer. The files are off the site but were shared across the internet through pirating sites. The new MakerBot facility – and the company's decision to concentrate its operations in Brooklyn – has received considerable support from the city government. City's chief digital officer Rachel Sterne Haot praised MakerBot for basing the company's organization and production in Brooklyn. ""MakerBot is the future of manufacturing, the future of New York,"" said Sterne Hoat, who stressed the value of the company creating jobs. She also predicted the factory opening would lead to the revitalization of the surrounding area, which counts other warehouses, big-box retailers and a self-proclaimed ""world-class cabaret,"" as neighbors. According to Sterne Haot, nearly 1,000 tech companies manufacture their products in New York. She hopes to make the city the global capital for 3D printing. When explaining MakerBot's decision to manufacture its printers in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Pettis cited extensive travel time to and from potential production sites abroad, increasing wages in some Asian countries, and rising fuel costs, which would make the shipment of completed printers significantly expensive. ""But also Brooklyn is just the best place in the world,"" Pettis said, which drew cheers from the audience. These printers, he added, are ""made with Brooklyn pride."""
732	733	Co-op's difficulties should inspire us to nurture banking's undergrowth 	"ampaigners for co-operative capitalism have an ambivalent relationship with the Co-operative Bank. A year ago, when the ambitious deal to take over more than 600 Lloyds branches looked destined to succeed, it was seen as the symbolic outrider for an entire movement: a test case that would help to prove a co-operative heritage and an ethical outlook were no bar to achieving commercial success in the financial sector. Last week, when it fell into the hands of hedge funds, they muttered that its status as a public limited company – albeit one wholly owned by the Co-op – meant it was a strange hybrid, instead of a ""true"" mutual, so its near-collapse held few wider lessons for the sector. In truth, the reason so much faith was placed in the Co-op – by loyal customers, as well as ideological fellow-travellers – was that there are so few alternatives for anyone who believes there must be a better way of doing things. Between them, RBS, Lloyds, HSBC and Barclays hold . And they are all shareholder-owned, profit-seeking enterprises, with global ambitions, lamentable reputations for customer service and a shopping list of fines for mis-selling and other malfeasance. Britain's banking landscape is a bleak, windswept monoculture. It's hard to answer definitively the question of whether a bank's ownership structure shapes its behaviour. Certainly, shareholders have repeatedly shown themselves to be utterly supine in the face of over-aggressive expansion plans, absurdly generous bonus schemes and cavalier financial management. It's undeniably true that, as the parliamentary commission on banking standards catalogued , the banking plcs that appeared to be the future when a wave of demutualisations swept through the financial sector in the 1990s have not served society, the taxpayer, or Britain's businesses well. What's also clear is that other countries have a far more varied system of banking institutions, whether it's the many thousands of thriving credit unions in the US, of which about 44% of Americans are members, or the network of Sparkasse savings banks across Germany, where more than two-thirds of banks are local, instead of national. The coalition has made some moves towards nurturing diversity, including loosening regulations on setting up new banks, and providing taxpayer funding to help credit unions expand; while campaigns such as have helped to highlight the availability of smaller alternatives to the faceless high-street giants. An increasingly vibrant undergrowth of alternatives to banks, such as crowdfunders and peer-to-peer lenders, has also begun to thrive. Far from signalling the demise of an impossible ideal, the death of the Co-op's ambitions should only encourage ministers, campaigners and consumers to redouble their efforts, and demand better banking."
740	741	3D-printed fashion: off the printer, rather than off the peg 	"he most eye-catching prints in fashion aren't florals or leopardskin but printouts. Fantastical 3D-printed designs created by a pulsed laser that layers powdered rubbers or metals into a shape calculated by computers. These creations, by Dutch designer Iris van Herpen, are the first created with to grace the catwalk. They're loved by the likes of Lady Gaga and Bjork, but have implications for your wardrobe too. While this manufacturing technique – originally developed for engineers – has history in jewellery and shoe design, the possibilities for the clothing industry are tantalising. It could revolutionise garment sizing and product development in mass production. It could also allow startup labels to produce small orders to avoid unsold stock, and allow easy customisation. All this is possible, but for now 3D-printing fashion has pragmatic problems to address. Though van Herpen's collection featured a printable fabric that is flexible, durable and can even be bunged in the washing machine, most items produced with this technique are unforgivingly stiff synthetics. Great for Gaga's stage show, not so practical for the school run. Printing costs are also still prohibitively high. While fashion has never been an industry to fret about cost, high-end style usually involves hand-finished, artisinal craftsmanship and natural materials such as silk and leather. For ""tech couture"" to evolve from a niche trend, there'll have to be a radical rethink of the definition of luxury fashion. The idea that manipulating code to make clothes fit the human form is a new couture skill may take designers and their ateliers of seamstresses some time to get their heads around. But that idea – that wearing a 3D-printed outfit is as close as we can currently get to wearing code – is an intriguing one."
745	746	Rabobank boss quits over £662m Libor rigging fine 	"The rigging scandal was reignited on Tuesday when the boss of Rabobank quit after the Dutch bank was fined €774m (£662m) for manipulating the benchmark interest rate. The fine, the second largest for Libor rigging after the £940m paid by Swiss bank UBS, was the fifth levied by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic in their attempt to crackdown on the manipulation of the key interest rate. It comes as a new investigation begins into similar allegations of manipulation in the £3tn-a-day currency markets. UBS and Deutsche Bank became the latest to admit they were co-operating with investigations into currency benchmarks, as the US justice department acknowledged for the first time it was involved. As Piet Moerland, the Rabobank chairman, announced he would step aside earlier than planned, regulators said some of the bank's traders had colluded with rivals at other financial firms to move rates to make a profit in one of the worst such cases they had investigated. About 30 individuals were involved, according to the mutually-owned bank – which was set up in 1898 to fund Dutch farmers and until now had escaped the financial crisis virtually unscathed and without needing the taxpayer bailouts handed to rivals. There were 500 instances of attempted Libor manipulation, directly or indirectly involving at least nine managers. One manager facilitated a culture in Rabobank's offices in New York, London, Utrecht, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore where attempted manipulation appeared to be accepted or even endorsed by the bank, regulators said. Rabobank has also entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US department of justice. The regulators unleashed the customary cache of emails containing colourful language used by traders. One manager said to a trader that he was ""fast turning into [that trader's] bitch!!!!"". Another was offered ""546 beers"" for changing rates. ""Don't worry mate – there's bigger crooks in the market than us guys!"" one submitter wrote. Moerland, who had been with the bank – which prides itself on its integrity and its roots in the agricultural business – for 30 years, said he was shocked by the practices uncovered. The bank did not lose its AAA rating until 2011. ""I sincerely regret that a number of Rabobank employees acted in an inappropriate manner. This should never have taken place at Rabobank,"" said Moerland. ""The conduct of these individuals, and the language of some of the individuals' communications, has shocked me. Rabobank fully understands the sense of indignation that this will cause both within our organisation and more broadly."" The US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said Rabobank employees had been making submissions to Libor that they saw at the time as ""ridiculous"", ""obseenly [sic] high"" and ""silly low"". Libor – set in a number of currencies by special ""submitters"" at so-called panel banks – is supposed to be the price that banks would charge each other to borrow in the markets and is used to price about £300tn of contracts around the world. But Rabobank sat its submitters next to its traders and in some cases traders assumed the role of submitter. One of its US dollar traders was known as the ""Ambassador"" or ""Ambass"" while one of its submitters was referred to as ""madame cadburry"", according to documents released by the regulators. The – which is levying £105m of the total fine – said the bank had no regard to the integrity of the market. Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime, said: ""Rabobank's misconduct is among the most serious we have identified on Libor. Traders and submitters treated Libor submissions as a potential way to make money, with no regard for the integrity of the market. This is unacceptable."" The fine is largely related to yen Libor and, to a lesser extent, dollars and sterling. None of the individuals were identified by the FCA although some were referred to by job titles by the US regulators. The FCA, along with other regulators, has fined Swiss bank UBS, RBS and Icap, as well as Barclays, the first bank to be fined, in June 2012. In June, Moerland said he would retire from the bank next year. He is replaced by Rinus Minderhoud, a member of the supervisory board since 2002. Moerland acknowledged that Rabobank had not appreciated the risk involved in setting Libor and its euro equivalent, Euribor. ""We have taken severe disciplinary measures against employees directly involved in or otherwise responsible for the unacceptable conduct,"" he added. Some had already left and five been fired with €4.2m of bonuses being withheld. SAC Capital is to plead guilty to securities fraud as part of a landmark settlement over insider trading at the hedge fund, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Connecticut-based company, which is run by the billionaire investor Steven Cohen, has been under investigation for seven years. The paper said the exact timing of any agreement had not yet been agreed but a deal could be unveiled by the end of this week. It comes as the US authorities are trying to finalise the details of a $13bn (£8bn) agreement with JP Morgan over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds. That agreement was expected last week, but talks appear to have stalled."
746	747	HSBC plans to give staff shares to avoid Brussels' new cap on bankers' bonuses 	Britain's biggest bank, HSBC, is preparing to hand out multimillion-pound share awards to 1,000 of its top staff as it attempts to bypass the new rules capping bankers' bonuses. , which has previously admitted it was considering salary rises across the board to tackle the limit on bonuses, has been discussing with its key investors ways of making quarterly payments of shares to keep up the level of its top bankers' pay. The cap, which came into force on 1 January, bars banks from paying bonuses worth more than individuals' salaries, unless shareholders approve the payments, in which case they can be only twice the size of the salaries. The rule is opposed by the chancellor, George Osborne, who is taking legal action against it, and by the Bank of England, which has warned it would push up the costs of running banks. HSBC's chairman, Douglas Flint, would back any schemes that kept the bank competitive. Its staff will be subject to the bonus cap wherever they work in the world, while employees of US and Asian banks will only fall under the restrictions if employed in the EU. HSBC, which would not comment, is proposing that the top bankers who receive the extra awards of shares will be required to retain them for five years after selling some to meet their tax obligations. The plans to tackle the bonus cap are the latest to be exposed at a time when major banks across the City are preparing to award bonuses for 2013 – not affected by the limitations – starting with the US banks such as next week. Barclays is – probably in shares rather then the initial proposal of cash. Other banks may yet attempt to opt for salary rises. The individuals affected by the bonus cap will be registered with local regulators and the European Banking Authority, which changed its definition last month of the bankers who are bound by the rules. In May it had proposed that anyone earning more than €500,000 (£425,000) would be subject to the cap but has changed this to allow banks to exempt staff earning up to €750,000 if they are not taking risks. Shareholders of UK banks will be required to vote on the new pay plans at the annual meetings in the spring, including the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, which will need approval of its proposals from UK Financial Investments – which looks after the taxpayer's 81% stake.
748	749	Financial Conduct Authority launches currency markets investigation 	"Suspicions that the vast global currency markets may have been rigged by major banks and traders has sparked the City regulator to launch a formal investigation into the £3tn a day market. Royal Bank of Scotland is among the major banks to have been contacted by the about the investigation, in a blow to the new boss of the bailed-out bank Ross McEwan, who took the helm at the start of the month. The investigation is likely to be on a similar scale to the far-reaching inquiry into interest rate markets that found that traders at a number of major firms had been manipulating the benchmark. After gathering information over the last six months, the FCA has now joined with a number of regulators around the world to investigate the dealing activities of banks and their traders in a market that is regarded as the most actively traded anywhere in the world. More than 40% of global forex trading is conducted in London. The FCA warned that the investigation could take months to conclude, but if misconduct has taken place, firms and traders could face fines and bans. The watchdog fined Barclays, , UBS and money broker Icap for Libor rigging. A number of regulators have already launched formal investigations into the foreign exchange markets, including authorities in the US and the markets regulator in Switzerland. They are focusing particularly on the way that a benchmark used to price a wide range of currencies may have been manipulated. RBS handed information to the FCA after it scrutinised a series of instant messages sent by a former trader, revealed this week to be Richard Usher, now a top trader at . There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Usher – who still works for the Wall Street bank – or any of the firms under investigation. JP Morgan declined to comment. Traders are said to have sent instant messages to a group known as the Bandits' Club or the Cartel. RBS said: ""We can confirm that we were contacted by the FCA on this matter. Our ongoing enquiry into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators."" A spokesman for the FCA said: ""We can confirm that we are conducting investigations alongside a number of other agencies both in the UK and abroad into a number of firms relating to trading on the foreign exchange market. ""Our investigations are at an early stage and it will be some time before we conclude whether there has been any misconduct which will lead to enforcement action."" The FCA's announcement came after Hong Kong Monetary Authority admitted it has also begun analysing the foreign exchange markets. The scrutiny of the foreign exchange markets may have been able to influence the way currency benchmarks – used by fund managers to value their investments – were set. The benchmarks, run by WM/Reuters, are based on prices during a 60-second trading window and it is suggested that traders were putting in client orders ahead of this crucial trading period. The benchmark rates are published hourly for 160 currencies and half hourly for the 21 biggest currencies, including sterling, which are set by calculating the median price of trades taking place in a 60-second window."

A man who has repeatedly and rigorously questioned the brilliance of his own ideas and found – much to his delight – that he and they are every bit as brilliant as he first thought.

Presumably because it had only been arranged a few hours earlier, once he had discovered that Labour had tabled an urgent question about the row. In the absence of his real adversary, Gove was reluctantly forced to turn his attention towards his opposite number, the shadow education secretary, , who tabled the urgent question. This is currently one of parliament's bigger mismatches. Hunt looks – and sounds – increasingly like Prince Harry and the TV historian has yet to demonstrate in the Commons whether he is more intelligent than his royal doppelgänger. In every exchange with Gove, Hunt has come a long way second and Monday was an even easier victory for the education secretary than usual because Hunt's own position on free schools has gone through several U-turns in the past few years. ""He has had more contorted positions on free schools than some Indian sex manuals I could name,"" Gove tartly observed. Some might classify this as too much information, but Gove could well be speaking from first-hand experience. Some Labour MPs made the mistake of referring to free schools as a vanity project. For Gove this is a compliment. He may not have a lot to be personally vain about, but he is assiduous in cultivating those few areas where vanity is possible. He is a dandy manqué. A showman. His clothes, his theatrical delivery, even his policies are expressions of his personality. Vanity. All is vanity. With only a lone Lib Dem, Sir Malcolm Bruce, daring to raise his voice – and then more in conciliation than threat – Gove easily quick-stepped his way through what might have been a tricky hour. Jeremy Corbyn came closest to landing a hit, with his suggestion that failing free schools should be subject to the scrutiny of local authorities. This would be a great idea, Gove admitted. Only it just so happened that all the failing free schools were in areas where the local education authorities were a complete mess. So it wasn't such a good idea after all. Shame. Who would have thought?"
753	754	One thing's certain in 2014: bankers will get bigger payouts 	"repare for ""an out-of-body experience"". We have Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, to thank for to negotiating a £4m bonus with an employee of the bailed-out bank and the recipient's fury at the level of the payout, which he considered derisory. A rival of the unnamed banker was getting £6m. ""This is absolutely outrageous to them, that somebody is getting 50% more,"" Hampton recalled. The RBS chairman will no doubt be braced for a round of similarly awkward experiences in the weeks ahead, as banks around the City enter their annual bonus season. While Hampton will undoubtedly be doling out large sums – – the figures will be dwarfed by rivals if history is any guide. Take the US banks. In the coming fortnight the biggest players on Wall Street – Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan – will all report results for 2013, which will determine the size of the payouts to their workforces. Data published just as the old year was ending provided a timely reminder of the pay deals on offer to top financiers. In 2012, the average pay of 115 senior risk-takers at Goldman Sachs in London was more than £2.7m. At JP Morgan – in a year when it suffered the disastrous trading incident – the top 126 London-based staff were handed £2m each. At Bank of America Merrill Lynch the average stood at just under £1m. In just the first nine months of 2013 the big US banks set aside $63bn (£39bn) to pay their staff. Analysts at Sanford Bernstein reckon that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will pour another $6.3bn into the pay and bonus pot when they report their full-year results next week. The brown envelopes outlining the size of each employee's bonus will he handed out shortly afterwards. The US banks are not obliged to admit how many of their employees receive more than £1m, but the UK banks are starting to providing such information. Barclays has recently admitted that in 2012 it paid 428 staff more than £1m – which is more than double the number handed such a sum by HSBC, a bank twice as big. Recent data from the European Authority, the pan-European regulator, showed that more than 2,700 London-based bankers received at least €1m (£830,000) in 2012. With these numbers in mind it is little wonder that lawmakers in Brussels – representing individuals who have endured years of austerity, falling real wages and rising unemployment – set out to try to put to a lid on pay. As of the start of this year, top bankers will have their bonuses capped at a level equal to their salary – or double their salary if shareholders approve. That has prompted a major scramble by banks to find ways to circumvent the new rules. Barclays, for instance, is handing its staff an extra allowance – a new, third payment, not classed as salary or bonus, to get round the restrictions. Even before the regulations come into force, Brussels has failed to stop bankers' pay spiralling further out of control. Antony Jenkins, the boss of Barclays, has promised shareholders they will get a bigger share of the spoils in the years ahead in the form of dividends. But that will not tackle the level of bonuses. Jenkins said only last week that ""to be in certain types of business, you have to accept the pay structures in those industries"" – basically a message to shareholders and regulators that they will just have to suck it up. And a signal of more out-of-body experiences looming. Justin King, chief executive of Sainsbury's, has been named the businessman's businessman not once but twice in the past few weeks. He snaffled the accolade of Britain's most admired leader in November, and on 3 January was picked as most impressive business leader in the . While not taking anything away from King's stewardship of Sainsbury's, it is remarkable that Next boss Simon Wolfson is not held in equal, if not higher, esteem. On Friday Wolfson unveiled a Christmas trading update which smashed expectations – year-on-year sales up 12% in a supposedly grim market for clothing, powered by high-street sales up more than 7% and online sales rising more than 20%. The shares rocketed to £60.85 – up 10% on the day and 57% on the year. When Wolfson took over 12 years ago they were around £10. Next is now valued at some £2bn more than Marks & Spencer, even though its turnover is less than half that of M&S. This year, for the first time, Next is expected to make more profit than its rival: some £684m-£700m, compared with an expected £650m at M&S. When Wolfson, then just 29 years old, was made a director of Next in 1997, the chain was making £160m a year. In the same year M&S made more than £1bn. Of course, part of the reason Next has made such advances on M&S is that the grand old lady of retail has made so many errors over the past few years – poor products, failure to invest in stores and distribution, failure to get ahead of the curve online. Next has also made mistakes – it has just recovered from them better. Both businesses are fishing in the same tough, mass-market, mid-priced, middle-England, own-brand pool. But while M&S has flailed around, Wolfson's quiet discipline, which includes strict rules on matters such as store openings and share buybacks, and excludes starry behaviour like posing with models, has paid dividends – literally so this year, in the form of a special 50p-a-share payout. Playing ugly in business doesn't always guarantee success, according to a study by economists at the University of Wisconsin. It found that good-looking bosses earn more – and prettify their companies' share prices too. Using a facial attractiveness index to rate chief executives in S&P 500 firms, the study found share prices improving on days when the attractive chief executives appeared on TV, and that better-looking bosses achieved better returns in mergers and acquisitions, too. Marissa Mayer, the new boss of Yahoo, was one example, scoring 8.45 out of 10 for facial attractiveness and presiding over a doubling of the company's share price. The researchers stressed that the increase was not solely down to her appearance and were not suggesting that bosses should only be hired for their looks. But beauty is in the eye of the shareholder."
755	756	Swiss authorities investigate potential manipulation of £3tn currency markets 	"Swiss regulators are investigating a number of financial firms over the potential manipulation of currency markets, where £3tn changes hands every day. The regulator said that multiple banks around the world could be drawn into the investigation, which will raise fresh questions about the integrity of the markets. The said in a brief statement: ""Finma is currently conducting investigations into several Swiss financial institutions in connection with possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets. Finma is co-ordinating closely with authorities in other countries as multiple banks around the world are potentially implicated."" The regulator said it would give no further details on the investigations or the banks potentially involved. In June the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, and the role of benchmarks, in some of the most liquid and actively traded markets in the world. The role played by benchmarks in financial markets has been highlighted since the Libor-rigging scandal exposed traders at banks and financial firms around the world manipulating the key standards for interest rates. Barclays was the first major bank to be fined, paying £290m in June last year, but others have since followed including Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and more recently the interdealer broker Icap."
767	768	Cabinet split over George Osborne's plan for £12bn more welfare cuts 	"George Osborne is facing a battle with the work and pensions secretary, , over his plan to impose an extra £12bn in welfare cuts after the next general election. Conservative sources said Osborne's intervention – a proposal that also prompted to publicly warn that the chancellor is in danger of making a ""monumental mistake"" – had highlighted stark differences of approach between the chancellor and Duncan Smith over how to reform Britain's social security system. Osborne demanded that roughly half of future spending cuts in the next parliament come from the welfare budget. ""There is a difference in narrative between George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith who both want to cut back the welfare state,"" one senior figure said. ""There is the lopping off narrative of and then there is the narrative of making people less reliant on the welfare state by making work pay. But that takes a long time."" Osborne alarmed Duncan Smith and angered Clegg when he said on Mondaythat £25bn in spending reductions, due to be imposed between 2016-17 and 2017-18, would have to include £12bn in welfare cuts. The move risks creating a cabinet row that runs beyond Monday's public spat. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, after the chancellor's autumn statement last month that such welfare cuts would have to be introduced if day-to-day government spending on departments such as the Home Office is to be reduced no further than the 2.3% a year cut that has been imposed by the coalition since 2011. Osborne outlined the tough choices ahead when he said in : ""It's far too soon to say: job done. It's not even half done. That's why 2014 is the year of hard truths. The year when Britain faces a choice. ""Do we say: the worst is over; back we go to our bad habits of borrowing and spending and living beyond our means – and let the next generation pay the bill? Or do we say to ourselves: yes, because of our plan, things are getting better. But there is still a long way to go – and there are big, underlying problems we have to fix in our economy."" In an interview on Radio 4's Today programme, Osborne said he would seek to achieve some of the £12bn savings by targeting housing benefit for under-25s and by means-testing people on incomes of £60,000 to £70,000 who live in social housing. But one Whitehall source said that targeting those two areas would produce ""laughable"" savings. Department of Communities and Local Government figures show that the 11,000 to 21,000 council tenants, who earn more than £60,000 a year, each cost the taxpayer £3,600 a year. Targeting this group would produce savings of £40m-£76m a year. Department of Work and Pensions figures show that 351,678 people under the age of 25 claim housing benefit at a cost of £1.8bn. Of these 55.6% of these are parents, which means the cuts would not apply to them. Osborne's plan would therefore produce savings of £827.4m in this area. But Whitehall sources suggested this figure could be reduced to as low as £50m once other groups among the under-25s, such as victims of domestic violence, are excluded from housing benefit cuts. ""It is laughable that you can get anywhere near £12bn in cuts this way,"" one source said. Osborne also ruled out cutting pensioner benefits, such as the winter fuel allowance and free television licences for the over-75s, on the grounds that this would only make savings of a ""few tens of millions"". But Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said: ""On winter fuel payments plus TV licences you get up to £2bn depending on how aggressively you means test."" Emmerson also said that David Cameron's decision to guarantee the pensions ""triple lock"" – increasing them annually in line with the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5% – would cost £15bn a year by 2050. But Emmerson said it would be unlikely to be too costly if the economy grows – and Britain avoids a recession – in the next parliament. ""The funny thing about the triple lock is that you have to increase pensions by the greater of prices, earnings or 2.5%. Over the next parliament the OBR thinks that earnings will be bigger than 2.5% or inflation every year. So therefore it costs zero [in real terms]."" As the debate intensified, Robert Chote, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, endorsed a claim by the IFS director that Osborne's plans would mean hitting the sick and disabled. Chote told Radio 4's The World at One: ""The decision to stick with the triple lock, which basically ensures that you are not going to reduce by very much the share of national income that you're spending on the state pension, means that if you want to get money out of the social security budget in total, it does have to come from the sorts of areas that Paul [Johnson] is talking about."" Clegg chose to describe Osborne's plans to target cuts on the working-age poor – while ruling out tax increases – as ""lopsided and unbalanced"". In a sign of how coalition relations will remain fractious until the election in May 2015, the deputy prime minister said: ""You've got a Conservative party now who are driven, it seems to me, by two very clear ideological impulses. One is to remorselessly pare back the state – for ideological reasons just cut back the state. ""Secondly – and I think they are making a monumental mistake in doing so – they say the only people in society, the only section in society, which will bear the burden of further fiscal consolidation are the working-age poor."" Signalling how he will waste no time in publicly criticising Tory plans over the next 16 months, Clegg later added: ""I literally don't know of a serious economist who believes that you only do it from that lopsided, unbalanced approach. Almost all serious economists say you have some kind of mix."" Clegg has agreed spending plans with Osborne for the first year after the general election and has accepted the need for fiscal tightening of £25bn between 2016-17 and 2017-18 in order to meet the target of eliminating the budget structural deficit by 2017-18. But in a taste of what is likely to be one of the main election battles – over the means by which the deficit should be cut – Clegg said it was wrong of the chancellor only to highlight the welfare bill for cuts and said the chancellor was wrong to play down the need for further tax rises. Clegg's remarks show the Liberal Democrat manifesto for the next election will include a ""mansion tax"" on properties worth more than £2m. But the Lib Dems will also include the costly ""triple lock"" on pensions. David Cameron said on Sunday that the Tories would guarantee the triple lock, one of the main features of the Lib Dem manifesto in 2010, until 2020. The Lib Dem mansion tax would raise about £2bn. But Clegg said he was committed to achieving at least 20% of the £25bn fiscal consolidation – £5bn – through tax increases. This means he would have to find a further £3bn in tax increases imposed on the wealthy."
768	769	Ed Miliband promises 'reckoning with our banks' to tackle cost of living crisis 	" has promised he has the strength to tackle the vested interests in Britain as he pledged to dismantle the big five banks and force them to sell branches to at least two new challenger banks. He said: ""We need a reckoning with our banks, not for retribution but for reform to tackle the cost of living crisis in this country. ""After decades of banking becoming more and more concentrated, I am determined that will turn that tide. ""I want to send a message to our small and medium-sized businesses: under the next Labour government, instead of you serving the banks, the banks will serve you."" He insisted the challenge of Britain's broken banks was the biggest test ""of whether we are serious about building a new economy and tackling the cost of living crisis"". British banking had some of most concentrated patterns of ownership in the world, he said. His proposals put Lloyds and RBS in the line of fire, and his promise to break them up hit their share price on Friday, . Miliband said mistakes in regulating the banks had been made by the last Labour government and all around the world, but he said there had been a decades-long failure by British banks, stretching back before the crash, to serve the real economy. His proposals include a cap on the size of banks' market share and the introduction of two new challenger banks with an 8% market share. He said the details would be passed to the Competition and Markets Authority to determine the detail within six months, but insisted the consolidation of British banks was going to be reversed. Although his plans for a cap on market share have been criticised by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, Miliband sidestepped claims that they were at loggerheads, saying Carney had not seen his full speech. The British Bankers' Association said an arbitrary cap could endanger customer choice and see some poorer customers lose out. The business secretary, Vince Cable, said Miliband was in danger of reinventing the wheel and pointed to Williams & Glyn's Bank and TSB as examples of new challenger banks already in existence under the coalition. Cable said there was over-concentration in business lending but setting arbitrary limits was not the right solution. Rather than starting from scratch, he said, Miliband should focus on lending to small businesses. In his speech in London Miliband tried to offer an optimistic vision of a high-skill, high-wage economy and broaden his familiar argument about living standards to say Westminster was only slowly catching up with its significance. He also insisted that deficit reduction was necessary but not a sufficient economic policy. He said: ""The living standards crisis is about the most vulnerable in our country who feel they are just being tossed aside. It is about who we are as a country, and who we want to recover to be. But we can only do better if the conversation in politics catches up with our country. For too long politicians acted as if when something wasn't talked about in politics or wasn't big on our television screens, somehow it wasn't happening. ""Some people in Westminster still ask me: is the cost of living crisis really such a big deal? Isn't it just a short-term problem? This shows they just don't understand. The cost of living crisis is the single greatest challenge our country faces. Not since the century before last have we seen such a sustained fall in living standards."" He said: ""This cost of living crisis reaches deeply into people's lives and deeply into the way our country is run."" Turning to financial services, he said banks had been a pretty poor servant of the real economy, not just since 2010 or 2008, but for decades. He said: ""I am not asking about whether we should have new banks, the question this government is still asking, but about how. ""It is not about creating new banks that control some small proportion of the market so they cannot compete, but new banks that have a substantial proportion and can compete properly with existing banks. ""And we are not asking whether existing banks must divest themselves of significant numbers of branches. We are asking how we make that happen."" He added: ""In America, by law, they have a test so no bank can be so big and dominate the market. We will follow the same principle for Britain. ""So under the next Labour government we will establish for the first time a threshold for the market share any one bank can have of personal accounts and small business lending. Beyond that they will not be allowed to grow over this threshold through mergers and acquisitions with other banks."""
773	774	Barclays' rights issue is a victory for common sense 	"So this is what being a ""go-to"" bank means: you go to your shareholders for £5.8bn to repair an over-stretched balance sheet. Barclays shareholders should ask why chief executive ever thought he could avoid a thumping great rights issue. The numbers revealed on Tuesday were extraordinary. The bank's leverage ratio at the end of June was just 2.2%, way below its main UK rivals, who are all above 3%. And the regulator's demand that 3% be reached by June next year has revealed a capital hole of an astonishing £12.8bn, not helped by another £2bn provision to cover the mis-selling of PPI and interest-rate swaps. The figures should silence those apologists who argue that the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority is making unfair or iniquitous demands. The reality is that Jenkins, when he set out a plan in February to reach 3% by the end of 2015, chose to drive in the slow lane on capital-raising. The regulator has insisted he moves faster – and is right to do so. Barclays' £1.5tn balance sheet is still the size of the British economy and the bank's earning profile is still dominated by the feast-or-famine business of investment banking. It is an institution that should be funded conservatively. It should not lurk at the most leveraged and riskiest end of the spectrum. So forget the notion that Barclays' 1-for-4 rights issue is a triumph for the ""capital Taliban"" at the Bank, or a last hurrah for departed governor Lord King. It is a victory for common sense. The PRA can be criticised for cack-handed communications – its focus on leverage was not signalled clearly in advance. But, on substance, the regulator has got it right. Asking a bank to hold £3 of capital to support £100 of assets, and to do so soon, is a reasonable demand. Barclays needs more capital and, thanks to a share price that has almost doubled since Jenkins replaced Bob Diamond, has access to capital. There was no reason to delay making the bank safer and more able to lend. The cost to the bank, apart from a £100m bill for underwriting the rights issue, is an extension of a year to the moment when Jenkins thinks Barclays can generate a return on equity above its cost of equity. Instead of 2015, the new plan envisages ""in the course of 2016."" That's unwelcome news for investors, but hardly represents an earthquake. Instead of railing against capricious regulators, they should count their blessings. They now own shares in a bank whose relationship with the PRA has taken a big step forward. Then they should insist that Jenkins hardens up his promise that Barclays will get control of one of its biggest overheads – bonuses in the investment bank."
774	775	Barclays fights FCA report into 2008 cash call 	"Barclays is contesting the findings of an investigation by the into its fundraising at the height of the banking crisis five years ago. The investigation was first revealed a year ago, in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, when admitted that its finance director Chris Lucas – who is leaving the bank next year – was among four individuals being scrutinised over the disclosure of fees paid during two fundraisings from Middle Eastern investors that took place in 2008. The bank, which is also being investigated alongside the four employees, refused to reveal the conclusions reached by the City regulator but said it was contesting them. The regulator has not yet issued a formal warning notice, which would outline more details of its case, but the completion of the preliminary investigation comes as the bank prepares to draw up a prospectus asking investors to back a £6bn cash call vital to plug a £12.8bn capital shortfall. Antony Jenkins, the bank's chief executive, refused to elaborate on the FCA findings at a time when the bank is under particular scrutiny by shareholders who must decide whether to back the crucial fundraising exercise. In a formal statement contained in seven pages of legal and regulatory warnings, the bank said the FCA had provided its preliminary findings on 27 June and that it had responded to these on 25 July. ""Barclays expects further developments in the near term,"" it added. The City regulator's investigation was later followed by other authorities. In August last year, the Serious Fraud Office also began an investigation into the matter while in October the US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission and the justice department launched an investigation to establish if there were any breaches of the US foreign corrupt practices act. Last July when Barclays first disclosed the investigation by City regulator – then the Financial Services Authority – Barclays said that it ""considers that it satisfied its disclosure obligations and confirms that it will co-operate fully with the FSA's investigation."" The bank said on Tuesday that the investigation was specifically into ""certain commercial agreements between Barclays and Qatari interests and whether they have related to Barclays capital raisings in June and November 2008"". ""Barclays is co-operating with all the authorities fully. It is not possible to estimate the financial impact upon Barclays should any adverse findings be made,"" the bank said."
775	776	Nigel Farage accepts Clegg's challenge to debate Britain's EU membership 	" has accepted a challenge from Nick Clegg to debate Britain's membership of the European Union ahead of the May elections. The Ukip leader said he had ""absolutely no choice"" but to say yes after years of his Eurosceptic views being derided by mainstream politicians. The terms of the debate are yet to be worked out, but Lib Dem sources said Clegg would have no problem with its being televised. Farage said he wanted David Cameron and Ed Miliband to take part too, but did not think they would rise to the challenge. He accused the prime minister of running from the arguments, after Downing Street said Cameron was too busy running the country to take part. However, speaking on LBC Radio, which will host the discussion, Farage said he would happily take on Clegg alone. ""I've battled on for 20 years. I've been laughed at, ridiculed, attacked, but at no point in the 15 years that I've now been an MEP, at no point have we ever had a full national debate about the merits or demerits of EU membership,"" Farage said. ""Therefore, when the deputy prime minister says he wants to go public and have a debate with me on this issue, I have absolutely no choice. I've got to say yes because we need to have a national debate on what I think is the most important issue this country has faced for hundreds of years in terms of our constitution. ""I'm looking forward to the debate. I've spent years being told I'm a nutcase. Yesterday the deputy prime minister challenged the fruitcakes to take part in a national debate."" Farage said he was now looking forward to the , which are just over 90 days away, after suffering health problems that required major surgery. Ukip is hoping to challenge Labour for first place in the May polls, and beat the Conservatives and Lib Dems convincingly. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, has warned his party that it could be almost eliminated in the elections under a rising tide of Euroscepticism. Amid fears of a wipeout, Clegg told LBC on Thursday that he wanted to go head-to-head with Farage as ""Ukip is the party of out, while the Lib Dems are the party of in"". His challenge is an attempt to pick up pro-European votes from other parties, while the Tories are split on the issue and Labour's position has been criticised for lacking clarity. It also puts David Cameron in an awkward spot, as the prime minister is anxious to avoid debating with Farage on television in the run-up to the general election in 2015. Clegg's acceptance of the Ukip leader as a legitimate debating partner will add weight to Farage's argument that he should be allowed a platform in any televised leadership debates next year. Throwing down the gauntlet on Thursday, Clegg said: ""If Nigel Farage is either listening or looking at this programme I hope he would take up my challenge to debate, once and for all, publicly, should we be in the European Union, which I believe means that we have more people in work than would otherwise be the case, we keep ourselves safer because we can go after cross-border crime and terrorism, it means we can look after the environment in the way that we can't on our own or do we do what Ukip want which is to pull ourselves out of the European Union and so jeopardise millions of jobs in this country? ""That's the choice let's have the debate out in the open and I am very happy and very keen to debate that with Nigel Farage directly."" Labour demanded a head-to-head between Ed Miliband and David Cameron in the runup to the election next year, as the party played down the idea its leader would take part in the Clegg-Farage showdown. ""The priority for us is to ensure that there are debates agreed between the two prospective prime ministers of the country – Ed Miliband and David Cameron – at the time of the general election,"" a spokesman said. ""Anything else will be a matter for the negotiations after that is agreed."""
788	789	MPs to question Bank of England deputy over Barclays 	"Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the , will get his opportunity to explain the controversial conversation he had with the former Barclays boss Bob Diamond about the key Libor rate when he appears before the Treasury select committee on Monday. Tucker requested to appear before MPs, who more usually summon witnesses than receive requests to appear, in the hours before Diamond was questioned on Wednesday. There were expectations that the former chief executive would put him at the centre of the bank's attempts to manipulate the London interbank offered rate which led to its £290m fine last week. A to record a conversation he had with Tucker during the 2008 banking crisis led to a senior Barclays banker, Jerry del Missier, telling subordinates to reduce their Libor submissions. Del Missier quit this week. The memo also said Tucker had told Diamond that ""senior Whitehall figures"" were concerned about the rates at which the bank said it was borrowing during the crisis. Tucker will be under pressure to identify these Whitehall figures as Diamond insisted he did not know who they were."
801	802	Ian Gibson referred to Labour 'star chamber' over sale of second home to daughter 	"Ian Gibson, the MP who sold his second home to his daughter below the market rate, has been referred for ""urgent consideration"" to the party's ""star chamber"". The disciplinary body was set up this week to deal with MPs who may have brought the party into disrepute through their expenses submissions. Labour announced that the leftwing MP for North had become the fourth parliamentarian to be referred to its national executive committee (NEC). ""The panel will report back as soon as possible with recommendations to the organisation committee of the NEC on whether to remove Ian Gibson's endorsement to stand for election as a Labour party candidate,"" a spokesman said. Initial indications had suggested Gibson's local Labour party planned to rally to his support and would not press for him to be deselected. But the NEC announced its intentions to question Gibson, who had already offered to resign over his decision to sell his second home in London to his daughter at below the market rate. She had lived in his flat, full-time and rent-free, when he was there three days a week claiming expenses from the taxpayer for the cost of the mortgage, as he was entitled to do. Last April, he said he sold the flat to his daughter and her partner for £162,000 after buying it for £195,000 and even though it was valued at up to £300,000. Gibson said he had always planned to pay any capital gains tax on the sale, and had sold the flat to his daughter so he could rent a smaller property close to the Commons. Gibson had previously said he would stand down if he felt his constituents believed he had taken a step too far in helping his family. He is the fourth MP scheduled for an interview with the Labour NEC panel. David Chaytor, Elliot Morley and Margaret Moran are already on the list of those waiting to be questioned about their expenses. A Labour source said the party expected the panel to be meeting weekly. , the Labour deputy leader, Harriet Harman, said: ""I think there will undoubtedly be people not standing at the next election who might otherwise have decided to do so. ""I can't give you any sense of numbers, but ... the public expects high standards."" The panel will make use of the findings of the independent audit of over the past four years being conducted by the members' estimates committee. However, it emerged that the audit of all MPs' expenses would take three months to complete. The all-party members' estimates committee is expected to ask PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake the audit. A committee source said PWC may be able to comment on the laxity with which the nominally strict rules were enforced, but that details of the contract had still to be agreed. The committee will also be empowered to order MPs to pay back any claims that breached the rules."
803	804	Universal credit: Iain Duncan Smith blames civil servants for IT failings 	" has blamed civil servants for IT failings in the introduction of the £2.4bn universal credit system, which is designed to consolidate six welfare payments into one. The work and pensions secretary took the rare step for a cabinet minister of publicly blaming civil servants after the release of a scathing report by the National Audit Office (NAO) on the introduction of universal credit. The report said the welfare changes had been poorly managed and were riddled with major IT problems, threatening to increase costs by hundreds of millions of pounds. Duncan Smith told BBC Breakfast he had ""lost faith in the ability of the civil servants to be able to manage this programme"" and the vast IT development involved. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: ""I fully accept, because I could have written this report myself, that the problem was that those charged with putting together the detail of the IT – we rely on people telling us that is correct – did not make the correct decisions. But we intervened to change that and all the programme directors from outside have said we did the right thing. Even the report says this is the right process."" Duncan Smith blamed the initial IT team for failing to raise concerns. ""What went wrong with the universal credit team – and they [the NAO] are right about this – there was a sense that somehow they just wanted to be able to say it was all going well. And that was the key problem. ""I agree with that, which is why in 2011, with my concerns, I changed the programme to introduce a pathfinder and why in 2012, after my own independent review told me that my concerns were justified, we made changes to personnel and brought in outside people."" Duncan Smith said Howard Shiplee, the construction director for the London 2012 Olympics who was brought in earlier this year to lead the delivery of universal credit, had said the project would be delivered on budget and on time. ""The overall timetable of 2017 – we will deliver this in that timescale. It is a very important reform and it is a reform that will both save the government and taxpayers money and improve the lot of those most needing it."" The NAO said the universal credit project had been beset by ""weak management, ineffective control and poor governance"". Ministers have already written off £34m wasted on failed IT programmes for the project run by the Department for Work and Pensions and may be forced to delay its national launch beyond 2017, the NAO said. merges six different benefits, with the claimant receiving a single monthly household payment. It requires different payments to landlords, more online claims, and merges in-work and out-of-work benefits, requiring new definitions of benefit conditions for those in work. It also requires close co-operation between the DWP systems and tax officials at HM Revenue & Customs. It was initially planned that the project would be introduced nationally by October this year, but pilot projects were delayed and are now going ahead in four areas. The report was seized upon by Labour as evidence that Duncan Smith has covered up significant problems that could put welfare claimants and their families at risk. Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, described universal credit as a ""Titanic-sized IT disaster"". In urgent parliamentary questions on Thursday, Byrne told the House of Commons that the top civil servant at the DWP had confirmed to him that the timing of the entire programme may have to be put back. ""To hit his [Duncan Smith] deadline at the end of 2017 he must now move over 200,000 people a month on to the new system, that is a city the size of Derby,"" Byrne said. ""He has lost control of the programme and he has lost control of the department … The quiet man must not become the cover-up man."" The work and pensions committee chair, Dame Anne Begg, accused Duncan Smith of bullish behaviour and said he should ""stop over-promising what can't be delivered"". Duncan Smith told the house that he took ""full responsibility for the delivery of this. I will not shirk that,"" and retorted that it took determination to complete a project of this size. ""I'm not being over-bullish about this. The reality is it takes determination to drive a reform through. I have that determination and the department is determined, with support and help, to make this happen."" He said he could not give figures for how many would be in receipt of the benefit by the election in 2015 but added that he was seeking to shut down other types of payments in the next two years. ""I am looking to close down jobseeker's allowance and tax credits well in advance of the election,"" he said. In March 2013 Duncan Smith told parliament universal credit was ""proceeding exactly in accordance with plans"". However, the report outlined how the project was ""reset"" a month earlier following the involvement of the Major Projects Authority, which has the power to intervene on behalf of taxpayers. The auditors' report also found the government had not achieved value for money on its spending up to the end of April, most of which was spent on building IT programmes which could handle data for 184,000 claimants. Of the £303m spent on IT, £34m had been written off and the systems still had limited functionality. Margaret Hodge, the chair of the public accounts committee, said: ""The DWP seems to have embarked on this crucial project, expected to cost the taxpayer some £2.4bn, with little idea as to how it was actually going to work."" The NAO found the IT system could not identify potentially fraudulent claims, meaning manual checks were needed. ""Such checks will not be feasible or adequate once the system is running nationally. Delays to the introduction will reduce the expected benefits and – if the department maintains a 2017 completion date – increase risks by requiring the rapid migration of a large volume of claimants."" Civil servants were also accused by the watchdog of having weak control of the programme and were unable to assess the value of the systems on which more than £300m had been spent. ""These problems represent a significant setback to universal credit and raise wider concerns about the department's ability to deal with weak programme management, over-optimistic timescales, and a lack of openness about progress,"" it said."
808	809	How anti-gay groups use 'Russian Facebook' to persecute LGBT people 	It is known as the Russian Facebook, and it is the 8th biggest social networking site in the world, with over 239 million registered users and 55 million active daily. It is (VK), and it is host to videos of rapes, threats to kill, and the humiliation of gay people. While the world tunes in to the , hundreds of gay, lesbian, and transgender Russian citizens will be persecuted and attacked; the result of plots formed online by homophobic groups buoyed up by Putin’s . “Occupy Paedophilia” was one of the leading groups to feature in a Channel 4 programme, broadcast last Wednesday, which exposed the extent of the violence faced by the LGBT community. The group has a prominent presence on VK, with over 90,000 followers – as well as other local factions pulling in more supporters. use the site to connect with gay men, posing as potential love interests, before luring them into situations where they will be attacked, a process they refer to as “safaris” using “bait”. Uploaded regularly to the site, films show victims being violently attacked and humilliated. This is content that is easily available to view, and is “liked”, passed around, and shared on the site, seemingly without impediment. The leader of Occupy Paedophilia, Ekaterina Zigunova, has posted screenshots of abuse she has received from UK television viewers after the airing of the Dispatches investigation, in which she featured heavily. Despite the group claiming on screen that they are not neo-Nazis, but rather upholding a moral obligation to rid of paedophiles (whom they conflate with homosexuals), the VK pages of Occupy Paedophilia and other similar groups are littered with Nazi insignia. So what is VK doing about the profiles and groups which organise and post evidence of the criminal activity (although not recognised as hate crime under Russian law) which has brought so much widespread international criticism and resulted in calls for a ? When contacted by the Guardian, George Lobushkin, VK’s press officer, pledged to delete the content. “We do our best to remove the content that violates our terms of service, as fast as possible. Videos of violence and abuse are forbidden,” he said. “We also block and delete communities where users call to violence or illegal actions against gay people or any other people. Please note that we are the only Russian social network that lets its users select a same-sex person when specifying their relationship status. “But it is very important for VKontakte to be an independent company, equidistant from any ideological position or belief. People can express themselves freely, as long as they don’t commit illegal acts or call others to those.” VK is not the only social network site on which Occupy Paedophilia is operating. YouTube returns for the gang, and hate propaganda from Russian fascist groups is tweeted often. Kirill Maryin is a teenager in Novosibirsk, Russia’s third largest city, who has set up the Twitter account, . The profile’s name is simply Gay Teen from Russia, with a picture of an SOS sign, and the bio: “World, help us! I plead you! History must not happen again!” Kirill tweets about the everyday discrimination that he faces, as well as coverage of Russia’s politics, authorities, and how Russia’s homophobia is being covered by external news outlets. He told the Guardian he started the account to help the world understand the struggles of the LGBT population in Russia from the viewpoint of a teenager on the ground, rather than a celebrity campaigner. “General information about gay life in Russia has come from Nikolai Alekseev and his project GayRussia in the past few years. “I wanted people who live abroad to hear the true story of life for LGBT teenagers from Russia. I have no husband in Switzerland, I do not live in the ECHR, I do not organise Gay Pride in Moscow. I am an ordinary LGBT teenager, and in this country, that is incredibly dangerous. “Gays have become targets of crimes and human rights violations. The Russian state uses LGBT as a shorthand for ‘internal enemies’. Homophobia is very much prevalent in our society.” Gay Olympic athlete punches with rainbow glove at Sochi с помощью The time Kirill feels the impact of homophobia the most is at school. “I have been insulted and humiliated, and the teachers pretend that nothing is happening. I am called ‘motherfucker, fag, cock, a non-entity, a mistake of nature’. “Once they told me I should move to the Netherlands because that country is for fags. I hate my school, my class and my teachers. I have no friends there, and I dream of it ending. “I am not considered a person. I have low self-esteem. Psychologists cannot do anything, and they are often also homophobic. Honestly, I cannot see an end to this problem.” As Lobushkin points out, the site does have LGBT groups. I ask Kirill if thse help him. He tells me that although he has an account and has added many LGBT groups, he limits his activity and he does not openly identify as gay on the site because he could be targeted. “I would like them to remove all the fascist calls and actions. I do not feel free there.” is one of the biggest LGBT support groups on VK. The 404 element is a reference to the internet error message – ‘404 not found’ – because gay people feel isolated and ignored, and because Russian authorities like to pretend that gay individuals do not exist. Or as the group’s founder Lena Klimova explains: “they believe LGBT people arrived from Mars”. Klimova is 25 and lives in Nizhny Tagil, in the Urals area of Russia. She is openly gay and works as a journalist. Children 404 focuses on helping gay teenagers. “I saw that they needed help, at least this kind of help – the possibility to tell other people about themselves, the chance to speak out and possibly get some advice, to form a community online. “Homophobic harassment is very common on VKontakte, as in real life. And you don’t necessarily have to be openly gay, or a gay at all. The harassment hits everybody who is speaking out in favour of gays, everybody who looks like they might be gay, and everybody who does not conform to the standards of a “real man” or a “real woman”. On Wednesday, the same day as Channel 4’s Dispatches programme aired, Klimova was . She has been told her court hearing will be in a couple of weeks, and she faces a large fine. Lena was pursued after Children 404 was investigated by Vitaly Milonov, a prominent politician in St. Petersburg. “I am depressed. I feel very sad, hurt and bitter. LGBT people are experiencing harsh oppression: they are living in fear, they fear being fired, being beaten up, being killed just without any reason. In Russia such harassment isn’t considered hate crime. It is terribly frightening.” Despite pledging to remove the violent content and deleting the relevant accounts, five days after the Guardian’s enquiry only one video had been removed, turning a blind eye to the thousands of videos still hosted on VK;

Along with , , and the , the Guardian has taken the decision to add a rainbow-coloured “g” in support of Russia’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities for the .

Twitter users are now “rainbowifying” their Twitter avatars to show that they are opposed to Russia’s . and are two well-known Twitter users who have added a splash of colour to their accounts. Rupert Myers, a barrister and , was one of the first to put a rainbow on his Twitter for the Sochi Games and key to it spreading among British users. Amusingly, Myers originally created the rainbow Twitter avatar as a joke, believing the rainbowification of social media was a form of – minimal effort from people to assuage their guilt, without actually doing anything concrete to help. *If* the rainbowification of my avatar doesn't make Putin praise homosexuality at the Sochi Winter Olympic Opening Ceremony then I give up He really was quite sarcastic about the whole thing… If anyone else wants me to rainbowify their avatar, just ask. You can claim a generous fraction of the credit when Putin changes the law. …but then something happened that he didn’t quite expect. “The first of the tweets got an overwhelming response, people didn’t seem to realise that I was criticising the practice,” says Myers, “They wanted to be a part of something, and their enthusiasm really changed how I felt about it. “I became quite overwhelmed by the way that people clearly wanted to send a message, however small, so I started making them rainbow avatars too when they requested. I’m now quite moved by it. I’m straight but I am really disappointed with what has done.” If you want to add your support to Russia’s LGBT community by adding a twibbon or an overlay for your Twitter avatar, there are now various apps, such as or “I’ve gone from being quite cycnical about these gestures to realising people want to send a message”, says Myers, “and rainbowification is a cheerful, beautiful, simple way to reach out to people and say ‘we’re with you’.”

The internet company's logo was presented in the colours of the rainbow flag and also featured images of Winter Games events. The build-up to the Sochi Games, the opening ceremony of which takes place on Friday, has been disrupted by a debate over the apparent conflict between the central principles of the Games and anti-gay laws in . The doodle linked to search results for ""Olympic charter"" and quoted from it: ""The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play."" There have been widespread protests over the decision to hold the Games in Russia, which bans providing information on homosexuality to under-18s by law. Gay rights activists in 19 cities across the world spoke out earlier this week. And, in a speech to the International Olympic Committee on Thursday, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, spoke out against attacks on the LGBT community. He said that ""many professional athletes, gay and straight, are speaking out against prejudice""."
826	827	Shard hotel to finally open in May 	The much-delayed opening of a £40m hotel within Britain's tallest building is to finally go ahead this spring. The 202-room Shangri-La hotel in the 1,000ft-high Shard will open to guests on 6 May. But it will not be until September 2014 that all the rooms will be available in the hotel, which will occupy levels 34 to 52 in the towering structure, which stands close to Bridge station. And although guests are all guaranteed fantastic views over London, their nightly stays will set them back a pretty penny, with room rates starting at £450 and suites going for as much as £3,250 a night. This is the first Shangri-La hotel in London and only the third in Europe – after Paris (2010) and Istanbul (2013). The hotel at had been originally expected to open in spring 2013 but the date got gradually put back. Those with deep pockets who can afford to stay at The Shard will be escorted in a high-speed elevator from the hotel's entrance to the sky lobby on level 35. Subtle Asian touches in the lobby and lobby lounge will reflect Shangri-La's heritage, while modern and classic art with pieces from a mix of acclaimed Asian and British artists will be showcased throughout public areas. The hotel's 202 guestrooms and suites will open from levels 36 to 50 and will be among the largest in London. Rooms will feature floor-to-ceiling windows. The hotel will include three wining and dining venues and there will also be a gym and a pool as well as conference facilities.
829	830	G20 tax avoidance pledge 'still leaves poor countries vulnerable' 	Moves by nations to tackle corporate tax avoidance are welcome but will only begin to uncover the full problem while leaving poor countries still vulnerable to exploitation, tax justice advocates and anti-poverty campaigners have said. Leaders of the world’s richest nations resolved to finish in 2015 work on modernising international tax rules to address the issue of companies shifting profits and reducing government tax bases. In their communique following the meeting in Brisbane, G20 leaders affirmed the principle that “profits should be taxed where economic activities deriving the profits are performed and where value is created”. They also welcomed progress on taxing patent boxes, a practice whereby intellectual property royalties can divert profits from the countries where they are made. G20 nations would automatically exchange information flowing from banks to tax authorities on a reciprocal basis and using a global common reporting standard by 2017 or end 2018, the communique said. To address concerns of developing countries, G20 leaders welcomed deeper engagement from them in the “base erosion and profit shifting” (Beps) project run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). “We will work with them to build their tax administration capacity and implement [automatic exchange of tax information],” they said. “We welcome further collaboration by our tax authorities on cross-border compliance activities.” However, Bessma Momani, an analyst with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, told an earlier media conference it was too early to see whether an equitable tax system would come to fruition on the basis of the G20 offerings. Momani said G20 governments were still at the stage of discovery on matters of multinational corporate tax and needed to “change the rules of the game” because tax avoidance is completely legal. ActionAid’s global advocacy coordinator, Sameer Dossani, said G20 countries were more concerned with raising their own tax revenue than ending “the ongoing plunder of developing countries”. “To their credit, the Brisbane declaration addresses a crucial issue: where multinational corporations pay tax,” he said. “If an Australian mining company is making profit from selling what it mines in Africa, it should pay a fair share of tax in the African country.” However, a concern about the reciprocal nature of sharing company tax information was that the complexity required for that kind of data collection meant it was “only an option for rich countries”, Dossani said. Oxfam’s international executive director, Winnie Byanyima, said what was on the table currently was not enough to stop poor countries being “bled dry”. Byanyima called for a worldwide tax summit because most developing countries were still excluded from decision-making on global tax issues. She said it was unfair that the tax haven had a seat at the table while Sierra Leone – “where Ebola is raging and tax incentives for six multinational companies are eight times the health budget” – did not. A federal opposition MP, Terri Butler, said she hoped the lack of reference to “tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning”, terms that were included at an international meeting last year, was not a result of pressure from large corporations. Only a reference to “harmful tax practices” was retained. Butler also said it had been, until recent days, Australia that had been dragging its feet by resisting the adoption of the global common reporting standard for banks to tax authorities. Anti-poverty campaigner ONE said Australia, as the president of the Brisbane G20, had taken a backward step by omitting from the communique a commitment to transparency in the mining industry, particularly on payments to governments in developing countries. An ONE spokeswoman, Friederike Roder, said it was “a very negative sign” that Australia, with so many mining companies operating overseas, had removed a resolution obtained last year from the main summit statement. Dr Mark Zirnsak, of the Uniting Church in Australia’s justice and international mission unit, said the mention of patent boxes was likely to “kill off” enthusiasm among Australian business for the practice. Zirnsak said there were other “real positives”, including the specific reference to the Beps action plan, which if followed through would have ruled out such favourable tax deals given to corporations as revealed by the recent “Luxleaks” scandal. The G20’s research group co-director, John Kirton, said the practice of “offshoring” - in which companies shift headquarters from their countries of operation to seek out lower-taxing jurisdictions - raised the question of what is the right level of corporate tax among G20 companies. “We can all race to the bottom,” he warned. Kirton also noted it was multinational corporations that had the means to avoid tax by jurisdiction shopping, not the small- to medium-size enterprises that accounted for the bulk of jobs in any economy.
836	837	Lexus NX 300h: car review 	“Have you got shit for brains?” shouts a fellow road user. It’s raining hard and the traffic is at a standstill, but the man questioning my neurological make-up clearly thinks I should move forward anyway. He carries on shouting in fluent Anglo-Saxon. I decide to crack my window open an inch or two to give him a bit of my own mind (shit or otherwise) while, of course, staying safely in the locked car. But the one-touch electric window drops open completely, leaving us face to face. It surprises us both. The opening seems huge. He stares at me, raindrops running over the dome of his shaved head. Should he thump me or not? I could almost see his synapses sputtering and misfiring in the wet. He swears some more then trundles back to his car. I press the auto button and the window silently closes. He was frightening and depressing. But it was also ridiculous – being stuck in one of the most technologically sophisticated cars on the road next to a motorist permanently stuck in the dark ages. The car in question is . It’s the luxury Japanese carbuilder’s first foray into the hugely popular compact SUV market. The NX is here to break up the cosy cabal dominated by the likes of , and . Like the mean girls who run school playgrounds, these vehicles are chic, stylish, popular ruthless. The NX has its work cut out to break into their sorority. It certainly has the looks to do it. The NX is one of the most eye-catching cars of the year. Its designers seem to have taken their inspiration from Toblerone. From the creased panels to the sculpted lights, it’s triangles, pyramids and pointy angles everywhere. Curves are out; folded-paper corners are in. The front end is dominated by a vast spindle grille which sits between a set of squinting LED headlights and L-shaped daytime running lights. With its tiny eyes and pleated nose, the looks a bit like a Shar-Pei. When the Evoque landed on our streets it was both ridiculed revered for its outlandish design. The same fate awaits the NX. But after so many years of boring, homogenous, yawn-making Mogadon motors, it’s brilliant that we are once again getting some distinctive vehicles on the road. The small “h” in the name stands for hybrid – a combination of a 2.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine and a powerful electric motor. The entry-level S version is front-wheel drive only; all the other versions get four-wheel drive. As you’d hope with a hybrid, the NX has the skimpy appetite of a lady who lunches – a gallon of fuel will take you almost 55 miles down the road. No matter how often you sit at the wheel of an electric hybrid, the eerie silence is unnerving. In a big car like this, it seems even weirder. A monastery on wheels. Gently squeeze the throttle and off you waft. Despite all its unforgiving angles, the NX’s interior is a warm, hushed place. A bubble of calm. The beautifully finished cabin is packed with a dizzying array of gizmos and gadgets – adaptive cruise control, LED auto-dipping headlights, bird’s-eye parking camera, lane and blind spot assist, rear-cross traffic alert and a slightly irritating touchpad control for the infotainment screen. It’s a remarkable feat of engineering – its cleverness a tribute to the men and women who build it. Shame they can’t do anything about my fellow drivers… Email Martin at or follow him on Twitter 
837	838	European Commission to investigate Amazon's Luxembourg tax affairs 	The European Commission has opened an investigation into whether or not Amazon is avoiding tax through its Luxembourg EU headquarters. At the heart of the investigation is the arrangement by which Amazon’s subsidiary, Amazon EU Sàrl, pays tax in Luxembourg. The company pays a tax-deductible royalty to a second limited liability partnership, also established in Luxembourg but not subject to corporate taxation in Luxembourg. As a result, the European Commission says, “most European profits of Amazon are recorded in Luxembourg but are not taxed in Luxembourg”. The investigation will examine whether the amount of the royalty, which lowers the tax paid by Amazon EU Sàrl each year, “might not be in line with market conditions”. “The Commission has concerns that the ruling could underestimate the taxable profits of Amazon EU Sàrl,” it continues, “and thereby grant an economic advantage to Amazon by allowing the group to pay less tax than other companies whose profits are allocated in line with market terms.” Joaquín Almunia, the Spanish politician who is currently head of competition policy at the EC, said that “national authorities must not allow selected companies to understate their taxable profits by using favourable calculation methods.” “It is only fair that subsidiaries of multinational companies pay their share of taxes and do not receive preferential treatment [that] could amount to hidden subsidies,” Almunia added. Amazon’s tax affairs have long been under scrutiny. In May, Margaret Hodge, the Labour head of the Commons’ public accounts committee, after revealing that the company paid just £4.2m in tax in the UK in 2013. “It is an outrage and Amazon should pay their fair share of tax,” Hodge said at the time. “They are making money out of not paying taxes. I no longer use Amazon. We should shop elsewhere.” Part of the reason for Amazon’s low tax bill is the company’s wildly disproportionate profit and income. While its revenue has grown consistently, peaking at $75bn in 2013, its overall profit has remained flat due to heavy reinvestment of income from mature services into growing areas. Since corporation taxes are largely determined by profit rather than revenue, that heavy reinvestment filters down to the company’s tax bill. Over the past four years, the amount of tax Amazon has paid in the US has dropped, from $1.5bn to $506m, as has the amount of profit it reports, from $1.15bn to $274m, even as its revenue has increased from $34.2bn to $74.5bn. Amazon had not replied to a request for comment ahead of publication. 
838	839	Luxembourg tax files: how Juncker's duchy accommodated Skype 	he EU’s most powerful official is under mounting pressure as dozens more multinational corporate names are dragged into the tax scandal following a new leak of confidential documents on Tuesday. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the , has been battling to distance himself from the growing furore over the Grand Duchy’s role in facilitating “industrial scale” tax avoidance. Among the new companies exposed in the secret tax documents are Disney, FTSE 100 firm Reckitt Benckiser, the Skype internet-phone arm of Microsoft and Koch Industries. The Koch empire is the second largest privately-owned business in the US and is controlled by siblings who fund rightwing political campaigns. According to dozens of multinationals implicated in the latest leaks engineered complicated corporate structures that often helped reduce tax bills to a fraction of what they otherwise would have been. Documents analysed by the Guardian show: Skype, the voice-over-internet business now owned by Microsoft, used two Luxembourg companies and an Irish subsidiary to circulate royalties and profits in a pattern that helped its Technologies unit in Luxembourg report no corporation tax over a five-year period. Invista, an offshoot of Koch Industries that owns the Lycra brand, underwent a 26-step restructuring called “Project Snow”. Invista uses an internal bank that lends cash to other group companies at high rates of interest. The exotic corporate structure neatly allows the company to pick up a lucrative tax break in Switzerland and at the same time keep its Luxembourg tax bill to a minimum. The new revelations will step up the pressure on Juncker who, in his former role as prime minister of Luxembourg, pointedly praised Luxembourg’s tax policies, something that attracted Skype to the Grand Duchy. In 2005, when Juncker was both prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg, he said: “Skype will remain based here … this is partly because of the favourable fiscal environment we’ve created here in Luxembourg.” – some of which are many years old but still in use – , under his leadership, undermined the tax receipts of other nations by enabling large-scale tax avoidance by multinationals. Skype will remain based here … partly because of the favourable fiscal environment we’ve created in Luxembourg. “I am not the architect of the Luxembourg model because this model doesn’t exist,” he said last month, insisting that his government did no more than compete hard for inward investment as others did. Juncker has faced mounting criticism, including a censure vote in the European parliament, in the wake of the first document leak. The Guardian, together with the ICIJ and more than 20 other news organisations worldwide, revealed that about 340 companies – including Fedex, Pepsi, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Icap and Ikea – had secured tax deals with Luxembourg with the assistance of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Last week, the finance ministers of Germany, France and Italy demanded a clampdown on Luxembourg-based tax avoidance in a letter to the EC’s commissioner for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici. They said: “Our citizens and our companies expect us to cope with tax avoidance and aggressive planning.” The latest batch of documents show that the creation of aggressive tax structures is not limited to PwC alone. The new papers include similar deals secured for big clients by the remaining members of the big four group of accounting firms – EY, Deloitte and KPMG. I am not the architect of the Luxembourg model because this model doesn’t exist. On Monday, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge, said last month’s revelations had raised serious questions over Juncker’s suitability as the head of the EU’s executive arm. “Since I have uncovered all this I have questions about if Mr Juncker is fit to be the president of the European commission. I think if this had been around during the period of his appointment it might well be a different decision.” Widespread use of complex tax structures is believed to cost western countries billions in lost revenues every year. The structures revealed in the Luxembourg documents shelter corporate profits, leaving a hole in tax receipts for nations around the world. After being shown the Guardian’s investigations into Skype, Stephen Shay, a Harvard Law School professor who last year gave expert testimony on Apple’s tax avoidance structures in a Senate investigation, said: “ What Skype is demonstrating is the extent to which the smaller countries are willing to engage in tax competition - and they’re getting relatively little out of it. The losses to the other countries compared to the gains for the smaller countries are really disproportionate.” The new whistleblower revelations follow the leak of 28,000 documents from accountancy group PwC last month. Speaking this week, Hodge described PwC’s work as a “mass-marketed tax avoidance scheme”. PwC has denied mass-marketing tax avoidance. Skype and Koch Industries were advised by EY. The leaked documents detail confidential tax deals thrashed out by accountancy advisers with Luxembourg tax officials. They are known as “advance tax agreements” or “comfort letters” and give the green light for advantageous structures to be established. They are completely legal but increasingly controversial. Koch Industries said: “Like all Koch companies, Invista conducts its business lawfully, and pays its taxes in accordance with applicable laws. As the Guardian has previously acknowledged, all of our activities in these matters are legal.” US parented companies including Koch Industries’ Invista division, Skype and others included in the new cache of papers are taxed on their worldwide income by the American tax authorities. However, US tax rules offer generous loopholes for keeping tax on foreign earnings to a minimum. Microsoft, Skype’s parent, said: “Microsoft’s acquisition of Skype was finalised in October 2011, so we can only speak to activities after that date.” The statement added that Microsoft had since changed Skype’s business model: “As a global business, Microsoft adheres carefully to the laws and regulations of every country in which we operate.” Asked whether Skype’s 2005 tax ruling was still active, Microsoft declined to comment. The big four accountants have substantial and growing operations in Luxembourg. According to the ICIJ, EY’s office in the country brought in $153m of revenue in the most recent year with most growth coming from its tax business. It is planning to hire 350 new employees there. Just after last month’s PwC revelations, the accountancy giant held a grand opening for a vast new office complex in Luxembourg attended by the country’s prime minister Xavier Bettel and finance minister Pierre Gramegna. PwC had invited reporters to the event but withdrew the invitations in the wake of the first batch of document leaks. The EC has pledged to fast-track new legislation to establish greater scrutiny of sweetheart tax avoidance deals for big companies. Last week a spokeswoman for Pierre Moscovici, the European economics commissioner whose brief includes taxation, said draft legislation would be tabled within months obliging EU governments to share information on corporation tax agreements they have struck with multinationals. The latest revelations are likely to ramp up the pressure even further on Brussels to demand greater tax transparency among EU nations. The commission is already investigating tax deals awarded to several companies and is examining whether they amount to illegal state aid. In the case of Luxembourg it is probing deals handed to Amazon and a subsidiary of Fiat. Separate investigations are underway into Ireland’s tax relationship with Apple and Starbucks in the Netherlands. One of the schemes used by multinationals is known to tax planners as “the Swiss branch of a Luxembourg finance company”. Our graphic explains how this works. By 2005 Skype was established as one of the great disrupters of the digital age. Its use of the internet to carry voice calls threatened to undermine the world’s biggest telecoms companies, from AT&T to Vodafone, and made it one of the most coveted up-starts in the tech world. Like Amazon, another tech revolutionary, it used the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as a European corporate launch pad for its ambitions. So when it was bought by online auctioneer eBay for $2.6bn in September 2005, the country did not want to lose one of its most famous corporate guests. It was with some pride one month later that , then prime minister of Luxembourg, declared: “Skype will remain based here … This is partly because of the favourable fiscal environment we’ve created.” His comments were made in the context of remarks about Luxembourg’s ultra-low rate of VAT, from which Skype also benefited greatly. But they might have applied as easily to the generous – though undisclosed – corporate income tax treatment Skype enjoyed in the Grand Duchy. The origins of Skype’s Luxembourg scheme lie in the company’s drive to launch paid-for services. By early 2004 Niklas Zennstrom, one of Skype’s Scandinavian co-founders, was hinting at such plans. He was referring to SkypeOut, a service launched in July 2004 that allowed users to dial landlines and mobile phones anywhere in the world but pay local call rates. This was where Skype’s commercial value lay: not only was it tearing down the business models of established telecoms groups, this time there was a plan to make money with a low-cost alternative service. Zennstrom and co-founder Janus Friis mainly worked from an office in London with much of the coding and software architecture created by developers in Estonia. However, the main company in the group, Skype Technologies SA, had its headquarters in Luxembourg. On the last day of 2004, nine months before the eBay transaction was announced, Skype Technologies arranged for certain intellectual property rights – including IP connected to SkypeOut – to be transferred to a new subsidiary it had created in Ireland called Skype Limited. This IP was Skype’s crown jewels, the key to its commercial potential. And what did the Irish company provide in return? Published accounts for neither company are very illuminating. They do show, however, that on the day of the IP transfer the net book value of the new Irish IP-owning company was just €25,000. Later Skype’s tax advisers would explain to the Luxembourg tax authorities that the transfer had valued the IP “at cost” — that is, it was judged to be worth no more than it had cost to develop it. In a 2005 tax agreement, leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Skype’s advisers from accounting firm Ernst & Young justified the valuation in part by explaining that, although some paid-for Skype services had been launched, it was too early to gauge whether they would be successful and profitable. Moreover, Luxembourg tax authorities were told, large competitors were developing similar services. And Skype believed that, in the absence of profits, no buyer would pay more than cost-price for the brand. Leaked records show this explanation was accepted by the tax authorities, stamped “read and approved” on 30 June 2005 by the accommodating Marius Kohl, one of Luxembourg’s top tax officials. And that is not all Kohl rubber stamped for Skype. The group’s tax advisers also wanted assurances that they could expect to enjoy yearly tax breaks on royalties linked to the IP which had been switched to Ireland. Here is how the structure worked: Irish subsidiary Skype Limited licensed rights to use its IP to its parent, Luxembourg-based Skype Technologies, at no cost. Skype Technologies then licensed on those rights to a third company Skype Communications, also based in Luxembourg, in exchange for a substantial royalty payment from the resulting revenues. Skype Communications was the company from which users around the world actually bought SkypeOut call credits and other paid-for services. As these proved increasingly popular, revenues began to soar – and so did royalty payments to Skype Technologies. Royalties of €32.6m for 2006 had doubled a year later. By 2009, they were close to €170m, and two years on they had exceeded €260m. In view of the company’s tax structuring no provisions were made for corporate tax. For each of these years, however, Skype Technologies recorded no tax in its accounts. A mystifying footnote simply read: “In view of the company’s tax structuring no provisions were made for corporate tax.” Only through the leaked 2005 tax ruling, stamped by Kohl, does more of the picture become clear. Through its tax advisers, Skype had asked Kohl to treat 95% of the incoming royalties at Skype Technologies as if they had been paid out to its IP-owning subsidiary in Ireland. These notional payments then effectively returned to Skype Technologies in the form of dividends. The remaining 5% would be treated as the profit margin made by Skype Technologies for its role as middleman in the IP licensing chain that linked Ireland, where the valuable IP lay, with Skype Communications in Luxembourg, where payments were arriving from SkypeOut customers. The result, Ernst & Young tax advisers suggested, was that Skype Technologies should receive a 95% tax deduction against its royalty income in Luxembourg. And Kohl agreed. Had royalties of that size actually been paid to Skype Limited in Ireland, they would probably have been subject to tax there. But accounts for the Irish company record no royalty income and little tax paid from 2005 up to 2009. And after the 2009 accounts were published, Skype Limited was changed to Skype (Ireland), an unlimited company no longer required to file accounts. In 2011 Skype was acquired by Microsoft for $8.5bn. It is still based in Luxembourg. Luxembourg-based Arteva Sarl is a company that is easily overlooked. It has no paid employees and its registered office in the Grand Duchy is shared by about 670 other companies, according to an analysis of filings. The company has a Swiss branch office too, but there is little sign of large-scale business activity in Zurich, where the registered branch address is in the same building as a firm of advisers, Tax Partner AG, two of whom are listed as “deputy branch managers” for Arteva Europe. The branch manager, Raymond Keereweer is an experienced Dutch tax professional who gives his job title on LinkedIn as “tax director, Europe” for Koch International Shared Services. As well as listing his role overseeing the Zurich branch of Arteva Europe, he also works at other Koch offices in Geneva. Despite modest outward appearances, accounts show Arteva Europe functions as a huge internal bank buried within the labyrinthine financial plumbing of Koch Industries, a $115bn-a-year (£73bn) global conglomerate said to be America’s second-largest private business empire. This sprawling global enterprise is ultimately controlled from Wichita, Kansas, by the super-rich , Charles and David, fervent libertarians and among the most active financial supporters of anti-Obama campaign messages at election time. The brothers are leading funders of Washington thinktank the Cato Institute, advocates of radical free market ideas, including expounding the virtues of tax havens and warning against G20-led efforts to curb aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals — a “global tax cartel” plot, they say. Among America’s most politically influential billionaires — “the Kochtopus” as they are known to their detractors — Charles and David are also leading backers of Americans for Prosperity, a campaign group described as “America’s third largest party” by the Washington Post on account of the resources deployed at election time. At the end of 2013 loans and other sums due to Arteva Europe from other Koch Industries companies around the world – specifically firms within Invista division, a global chemical fibres operation best known for its Lycra clothing and Stainmaster carpeting brands – were $1.67bn. Despite lending to affiliated companies, Arteva Europe frequently charges very high interest rates, as high as 9.77%, generating considerable income – much of it for the company’s Swiss finance branch. In fact, in the last four years, Arteva Europe has earned interest income from fellow Invista companies of $208m. That accounted for the lion’s share of profits for the company, which totalled $269m. Over the same four-year period, however, Arteva Europe reports paying only slightly more than $10m in tax. Company accounts offer no explanation for why this tax bill is so low. The answer, however, lies in Switzerland, four-and-a-half hours’ drive away from the company’s head office in Luxembourg. Leaked tax rulings from the Grand Duchy tax office – rulings secured for Koch Industries’ by advisers at Ernst & Young – show the group wanted to make sure Luxembourg did not have taxing rights over profits Arteva Europe could demonstrate had been generated from its Swiss branch, registered to the office at no 80 Talstrasse, in Zurich, Switzerland. In Switzerland, meanwhile, finance branches of overseas companies qualify for generous tax breaks. The Swiss authorities tax these lending units as if they were required to pay large, tax-deductible interest bills – even if they have no such cost. So attractive are these arrangements, that dozens of multinationals have set up intra-group lending operations through the Swiss branch of a Luxembourg subsidiary. So controversial is the structure, however, that it has been criticised by the and is seen as unlikely to survive G20-led efforts to stamp out the most egregious tax avoidance schemes deployed by multinationals. Aware that its tax regime for foreign finance branches is facing international condemnation, the Swiss government has already published proposals to water down the benefits available – though it still wants to remain the go-to location for internal banks within multinationals. Levels of income and tax reported in accounts for Arteva Europe suggest the group has carefully ensured much of its most profitable lending is routed through the branch in Zurich, with very little income arising at head office in Luxembourg. That way, it picks up a huge tax break in Switzerland and minimises its tax bill in Luxembourg. Koch Industries declined to respond to specific questions put by the Guardian. In a statement it said: “Like all Koch companies, Invista [of which Arteva Europe is a part] conducts its business lawfully, and pays its taxes in accordance with applicable laws. As the Guardian has previously acknowledged, all of our activities in these matters are legal.”
848	849	PwC tax chief faces MPs over Luxembourg tax structures 	The tax boss at one of the UK’s top accounting firms will be deals for clients in Luxembourg. Kevin Nicholson, PwC UK’s head of tax, who worked as an HMRC tax inspector in the early 1990s, will appear before parliament’s public accounts committee following revelations exposing patterns of aggressive tax avoidance by PwC clients that were . The analyses were based on a cache of hundreds of leaked tax rulings secured by PwC Luxembourg that showed major companies – including drugs group Shire and vacuum cleaner firm Dyson – using complex webs of internal loans and interest payments which have slashed tax bills. The exposure of these arrangements - signed off by the Grand Duchy and all perfectly legal – triggered an emergency debate in the European parliament focussing on the track record of the new European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who had dominated Luxembourg politics as prime minister between 1995 and 2013. Juncker has sought to brush aside criticisms, insisting: “I am not the architect of the model because this model doesn’t exist.” Nicholson, who will be joined at the hearing by Shire Pharmaceuticals’ head of tax Fearghus Carruthers, appeared in front of the same parliamentary committee last year alongside counterparts from rivals Ernst & Young, KPMG, and Deloitte. At that hearing he was . He also declined to comment when confronted with a leaked tax structuring document by committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge, , saying he did not know of the structure. However, the detail involved in last month’s batch of leaked documents, plus the scale of the media reports prompted by their publication by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, will make it harder for PwC to avoid answering questions this time. While PwC is a distinct legal partnership from PwC in the UK, Nicholson is likely to be asked about the level of involvement UK staff have had in tax advice emanating from Luxembourg. PwC has said: “We stand by the evidence we gave to the public accounts committee in January 2013 and are very willing to clarify any of the points made.” Last year, PwC made . Meanwhile, PwC Luxembourg had turnover of €276m (£219m) for the year to June 2013, up more than 12% on the previous 12 months. Tax advice accounted for 29% of revenues, up from 24% two years ago. The Luxembourg partnership employs about 2,300 staff – equivalent to one in every 240 people resident in the small country. New offices for the fast-growing practice were officially opened last week at a ceremony attended by the duchy’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel.
853	854	Jimmy Wales: David Cameron's porn filter idea is ridiculous and will fail 	"Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, one of David Cameron's most high-profile technology advisers, has rubbished through the UK's internet service providers, dismissing the proposals as ""ridiculous"" and saying money would be better spent on policing internet crime. Wales, who advises the government on open access to information online, told on Friday the planned software would fail. ""When Cameron uses the example of paedophiles who are addicted to internet porn – all that these plans would do is require them to opt in,"" he said. ""It's an absolutely ridiculous idea that won't work."" The prime minister announced last week that by the end of 2014 every new contract with a UK internet service provider will ask customers to opt in to receive adult content. He said ""will have rewired their technology"" to keep children safe but gave little detail, leading critics to say the proposal is unimplementable and pointing out that the filters would only be activated for wholly new contracts. The agreement is with the UK's biggest ISPs, BT, Virgin, Sky and TalkTalk, who account for 90% of the UK's internet users. Wales said that existing legislation around criminal activity online, including abuse and credit card fraud, is adequate, but that police need more resources. Referring to the revelations around mass surveillance of citizens by the in the US through consumer internet firms, Wales said ""billions had been wasted shopping on ordinary people's data in a fruitless search for terrorists"". ""We should be devoting a significant proportion of that to dealing with the real criminal issues online, stealing credit card numbers, hacking into sites … that is going to take an investment in real, solid police work."" Wales also announced that Wikipedia is to introduce encryption to the site so that users are protected once they sign in, following a on Thursday. ""We trust our bank data to the same kind of encryption,"" he said. ""There will always be questions about whether the NSA has secretly managed to decrypt everything but we think that's highly unlikely. It's non-trivial to do it well, so we have to do it right."" Wales criticised Twitter, which he said has needed faster systems for complaints to protect users from abuse, but also said that illegally abusive behaviour was an edge case that shouldn't deter mainstream internet users."
864	865	Grangemouth crisis: Unite union now accepts plant rescue plan 	"The union at the centre of the Grangemouth crisis has decided to ""embrace"" a survival plan aimed at preventing the site's closure and the loss of thousands of jobs. Unite's leader, Len McCluskey, said the union was working to persuade owners Ineos to reverse . But he denied that the union had been forced into a humiliating climbdown by the plant's owners: ""My union is engaged with thousands of companies every day to negotiate plans to save jobs. There is nothing humiliating about negotiating plans to ensure jobs and communities are safe."" The development followed a meeting at the site between general secretary and union shop stewards. McCluskey said the shop stewards had decided they had to embrace the survival plan, ""warts and all"", in the wake of the closure decision. Workers at the petrochemical site, and adjoining oil refinery, had refused to sign up to the plan, which included a pay freeze, ending of the final salary pension scheme, and other changes to terms and conditions. McCluskey said: ""We are not going to let this plant close. We are encouraged by the comments of the First Minister that he too will not let this plant close. ""We have a situation whereby a company has put down an ultimatum and we have to respond. It is not how we engage in modern day industrial relations."" Ineos is expected to wait until further meetings are held later today involving politicians before responding to the latest development. Ineos director Tom Crotty has denied that the firm lured unions into a trap over Grangemouth. Speaking on BBC News 24, Crotty rejected the suggestion that Ineos has wanted to shut the plan all along, and used the unpalatable cost-cutting plan as a way of forcing the union's hand. If staff had voted in favour, he argued, Ineos would have invested £300m and the plant would soon be reopening. Crotty reiterated that Ineos will consult with shareholders again if the union substantially alters its position and accepts major changes at the plant. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister is keen that they are back round the table talking. Clearly, we want both sides to continue with those talks and come to a solution if possible. ""Grangemouth is clearly of vital importance to the Scottish economy and the Prime Minister is keen that those discussions continue and hopefully they can find a solution."" The government reacted with dismay to Wednesday's announcement and the climate change secretary, Ed Davey, pledged that all efforts would be made to rescue the plant on the Firth of Forth. Grangemouth is Scotland's biggest manufacturing business. Its refinery supplies most of the country's fuel, and the petrochemicals plant produces plastics used in industries ranging from cars to packaging. Its closure would have far-reaching implications for and the UK. The company said it had no alternative but to shut down the business after it failed to persuade its staff to accept a survival plan. Unite said about 680 of the site's 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the company's proposals, which include a pay freeze for 2014-16, removal of a bonus up to 2016, a reduced shift allowance and the ending of the final-salary pension scheme. Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agreed to the new terms. It said the plant, which has been shut down since last week because of the dispute, was losing £10m a month. In an urgent question on Grangemouth in parliament on Wednesday, Davey told MPs repeatedly that the government wanted the plant to stay open if at all possible. He said it would still consider a business case to provide investment to help keep the plant running, but Downing Street dismissed speculation that the plant could be nationalised, saying it was a matter for the unions and owner to resolve. The prime minister's spokesman said it was disappointing that the petrochemicals side of the plant had closed and called on both parties to continue their dialogue over the future of the refinery. Number 10 said the closure of the Grangemouth refinery would not pose a threat to fuel supplies, after the AA warned it could hit petrol prices. A dispute over pay and conditions at the oil refinery remains unresolved. ""What's different? The company's closure of the plant has led our stewards to believe the priority is to keep the plant open. We have to say to the company that the survival plan is something we are prepared to embrace and go along with if, if you like. But that includes discussions and consultation and we will see what comes out of those discussions. I wouldn't want to mislead you. Their survival plan requires us to accept certain things and our stewards' position is that we are accepting those issues. ""It's not that it's all up for negotiation. They are demanding we accept their ultimatums and we have decided to accept their ultimatums. The consultation will be around the logistics of those issues and the practicalities of those issues. There will be no doubt some alterations within the context of those discussions. What has changed is the company have closed the plant and have put it into liquidation and we are not going to allow that to happen and the stewards are now responding to the wishes of our members who may feel outraged by what has happened but the priority is to keep the plant open and we will see what the future brings."" "
870	871	Queen's speech: coalition to bring in law letting voters sack MPs 	"The government will bring in a new law allowing voters to sack misbehaving MPs under new legislation included in the . The new power of recall – promised in the coalition agreement in 2010 – will be triggered only if MPs are given jail sentences or if the resolves that they have engaged in ""serious wrongdoing"". Voters would then have to collect the signatures of 10% of constituents to force a byelection. Campaigners for the law – including the Tory backbencher Zac Goldsmith – claimed the bill did not go far enough because MPs would still have a veto on the powers. He claimed that voters had been ""duped"" by its inclusion in the speech and that the government had watered down the promise fearing it could lead to ""kangaroo courts"" for MPs. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton, said it looked like a ""cynical fudge which deprives constituents of real powers"", while the TaxPayers' Alliance branded it ""embarrassingly weak"". The Queen's speech, which sets out new legislation, contained a mixed bag of 11 bills and three draft bills for the final year of the coalition. Some of the newer proposals were for local elections to national park authorities, prevention of invasive species entering the UK, protection for have-a-go heroes and plans to force supermarkets to charge 5p for plastic bags from 2015. The bills are largely uncontroversial for the coalition partners but one area that is still be resolved is . The new infrastructure bill is expected to ""streamline the underground access regime"" to allow fracking under private property but this is still subject to consultation before it is definitely included. Fracking is a difficult issue for many MPs whose constituencies contain shale resources and is being fiercely resisted by many environmental groups. Hours before the speech, police were called in to where they had constructed a fake fracking plant. Some of the infrastructure bill's measures to speed up housebuilding could also be opposed by countryside campaigners. Ministers said the changes would ""get Britain building again"", giving developers power to push through applications without the need for council approval and making it easier for the government to sell off unused public land for development. The bill also waters down a promise to make all new homes ""zero-carbon"" by 2016, as it exempts small sites from the target. Labour has suggested the coalition is running out of ideas as the speech does not contain many grand ideas for transforming the country. The opposition has accused the government of creating a ""zombie parliament"", as Conservatives and find it increasingly difficult to find areas of agreement. Most of the bigger proposals have already been announced by George Osborne, the chancellor, at the budget and the autumn statement. These include a pensions bill giving people more control over how they save their money for old age, a small business bill that cuts red tape, increases transparency about corporate ownership and reforms zero-hours contracts, and a childcare payments bill offering tax relief of up to £2,000 on childcare. Responding to the speech, Ed Miliband said there were some worthy measures, including a bill to tackle modern slavery, the recall bill for MPs and a bill introducing a new armed forces ombudsman. But he said the legislative programme was not radical or ambitious enough to deal with the major problems facing families across the country. Labour would have had a speech offering a ""new direction for Britain, not one which offers more of the same"", he said. There was a ""chasm"" between the needs of the country and the action taken by parliament to address these, Miliband said. ""It is a basic belief of the British people that if you work all the hours God sends you should at least be able to make ends meet,"" he said. ""All of us say that if you do the right thing, you should be rewarded. But we should listen to the voices of all of those people who say that their reality today is that hard work is not rewarded."" In particular, he criticised the government for failing to include measures to reduce energy bills, raise the minimum wage, boost housebuilding, tackle concerns about immigration, devolve power to the regions or introduce more secure rental contracts. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, agreed that the new laws failed to go far enough and were not tackling the real issues for most workers. ""It is missing anything that will allow them to share in the recovery with a proper wage increase,"" she said. ""It has nothing to ensure properly funded public services, particularly the NHS, and there is nothing to rebalance the economy to ensure we create good jobs and a sustainable future. This is an underwhelming programme that misses the main challenges that this country faces."" There was also disappointment among animal rights campaigners that there was no legislation creating a ban on wild animals in circuses, which had been widely trailed and expected. The bills were announced by the Queen speaking before parliamentarians in the House of Lords. She delivered the coalition's key messages and slogans in a short speech, saying: ""My government's legislative programme will continue to deliver on its long-term plan to build a stronger economy and a fairer society."" Six bills will be carried over from the previous parliament, including the consumer rights bill, the criminal justice and courts bill (including knife crime, the subject of a coalition row), the deregulation bill, a second finance bill, the HS2 paving bill and the Wales bill. Small business, enterprise and employment bill National insurance contributions bill Infrastructure bill Pensions tax bill Private pensions bill Social action, responsibility and heroism bill Childcare payments bill Slavery bill Armed forces bill Serious crime bill Recall of members of parliament bill"
872	873	Queen's speech: bills in brief 	"This includes a commitment to publish targets and reports on cutting red tape – which might sound like bureaucracy to cut bureaucracy – but is the kind of thing that successive industry secretaries have always come up to answer the vague demand for less government from small business, ever since the young Harold Wilson promised a ""bonfire"" of wartime controls in the 1940s. Beyond that, there is the promise of tougher fines for firms who breach the minimum wage, which sounds good although the question is whether there will be sufficient inspectors to enforce it. There will be new rights for pub tenants who get exploited by the owners, which might be worthwhile even though it sounds like the sort of super-specific change that suggests someone with a particular interest has done some effective lobbying. Although curbs on ""excessive public sector redundancy packages"" are promised, the other items – the promise of ""fairer contracts"" for lower paid workers, registers of owners and stronger rules on barring dodgy directors – indicate a retreat from the so-called Beecroft agenda of a couple of years, which suggested that the only path to prosperity involved slashing labour market protections and letting the market rip. The Conservatives are nervous about the distinctly un-Tory prospect of strengthening workforce protection this close to an election, whereas Vince Cable sees it as a popular cause which can give the Liberal Democrats a bit of distinctiveness. But on his biggest target – zero-hours contracts – the argument will rumble on towards election day, a debate Labour opposition will relish. This will promote competitiveness, infrastructure investment and energy security. In practice, this will involve some concrete steps to encourage and facilitate fracking of shale gas, a particular enthusiasm of the chancellor, as well as some planning reforms to try and encourage the building of new homes (to a new zero-carbon standard), particularly in garden cities. This is dangerous territory for the Tories. The people of Balcombe in Sussex have protested against frackers Cuadrilla, citing experience of shale exploration in Lancashire which led to seismic tremors, and sites are uncomfortably cropping up in Tory strongholds. Labour may hesitate, fearing to look naive about energy costs. In days gone by, anti-fracking would have been classic Lib Dem pavement politics stuff. The question now is whether they can plausibly give a nod and a wink against out on the street, while their leaders remain on the inside of the corridors of power. Planning is always a political nightmare in Britain. Much earlier in its term, the coalition's attempt at sweeping reforms of planning provision was pushed back by resistance from the shires. At this stage of play, it would be foolish to bet on any government risking electoral mutiny by embarking on anything sweeping, which could be called a builder's charter. No doubt that explains the restricting emphasis on garden cities. Expect Labour to say it would be bolder, but to say less about exactly how. Designed to tackle avoidance of national insurance and simplify its collection from the self-employed. Tax-dodging is a more popular issue than in the past, but the wisest pre-polling day line on taxation is silence, and never more so than with the self-employed who pay their taxes directly and so particularly resent them. Peddling tax ""simplification"" will not get politicians very far with sole traders, if the upshot is that they have to pay more. Implements the budget commitment to a new childcare subsidy – a flat-rate entitlement of up to £2,000 for each child up to 12. The Lib Dems are claiming this as their flagship policy. One snag is that it isn't effective until autumn 2015, allowing Labour some space to talk up its plans to extend the number of hours of nursery-type provision Implements the abolition of the so-called annuities rule, the budget-time promise, which led to all those ""blow your pension, buy a Lamborghini"" headlines. The case for scrapping the rule is that annuities – fixed pensions for life – offer dreadful value for money because the insurance industry creams off much of the pension pot. The case against is that the whole basis of pensions involves pooling risks, and that allowing those who've got reason to suspect that they won't make their 90s to spend their tax-privileged savings early will make it even costlier for those who will live for longer to secure a decent pension. Other risks involve creating scope for tax avoidance, and encouraging yet more property bubble-puffing investment in buy-to-let. After dithering, Labour decided it had better go along with this plan. This will be the biggest piece of legislation before the election, more than a fag-end measure of a government seeking re-election. While Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb has enjoyed most of the credit until now, expect the Tories to begin reminding everybody that this was in fact an idea in the 2010 Conservative manifesto. The big idea here had been to try and salvage final salary schemes by allowing companies to offer much less generous terms than the old two-thirds-of-final-wage type pensions which they have now spent many years winding up. That, however, has been dropped, partly because employers said that they had no interest in getting back into pensions, and partly – perhaps – because ministers did not want to associate themselves with pensions which were just like the old ones, only much less generous. Instead, the emphasis is now on so-called collective ""defined contribution"" schemes, which are a bit like personal pensions, but should offer somewhat lower charges than these, and somewhat less risk too. This is possible because , as in the Netherlands, groups of workers can pool risk between them, which allows the schemes more flexibility to invest for the long term, and to give their members at least some indication of what they will pay out. Even the best candidate will struggle to engage the average voter on the doorstep by talking about the actuarial advantages of Dutch pension schemes. This will provide for extra compensation for those who are effectively enslaved – principally victims of trafficking. It includes new powers to grant victims certain immunities from prosecution and arrest if they can show they were coerced into sex work or the drugs trade. Important stuff, but will be hard to make into an election issue when no party is likely to disagree. This may sound like a vigilante's charter, but it is more specific than that. The focus is not on exempting have-a-go heroes from being prosecuted for assault, but rather about granting protection for ""heroes"" against being sued, or litigated against for neglecting their statutory duties in the heat of the moment. The bill will not tell the courts what to do, only to take into account the emergency that was involved. Seeing as they already have considerable discretion, the bill may change less than the spin will suggest, but could make a difference in some cases. Uncontroversial – which politician would not want to be on the side of heroes in election year? For David Cameron, in particular, it might be a way of breathing new life into his once favoured by now half forgotten theme of social responsibility, and suggesting to voters at the end of this term that he really did have a plan at the beginning. This will create an improved complaints system for the armed forces, through the creation of an ombudsman. With the forces tiny by historical standards, there isn't much need to court the soldiers' vote. But the wider public can still be raised to fury by reports of inadequate kit and stories about redundancies among the troops. It is, therefore, shrewd politics for ministers to have one thing on the agenda which they can point to as doing something for ""our boys"". This will tackle two popular demons. First, criminal gangs – making it easier to seize their proceeds, and also for the first time making it criminal to be associated with gangs, rather than for doing anything more specific. The latter is, effectively, the introduction of US-style anti-mafia legislation into Britain. The second set of villains to be tackled are neglectful parents, who (supposedly) for the first time be criminalised for physical as well as emotional neglect, although the fact that the emotional dimension has not be spelled out on the face of statute before does not mean that the courts have previously neglected it. Compared with Tony Blair's Labour, which had criminal justice bills virtually every year, the coalition has been relative quiet in this area. But with polling day drawing nearer, a bit of action against criminal gangs seems especially timely. Likely to get cross-party support. The coalition promised it at the very beginning, but difficulties in settling in what it would cover, as well as David Cameron's dwindling interest in reforming the process of politics has seen it shelved for years. With new sleaze stories bubbling back up in recent months (Patrick Mercer's resignation, the roots of this week's by-election in Newark, is only one example) Clegg seized his moment and put it back in the programme. So the bill will happen, but is likely to change very little. 10% of constituents can petition to recall MPs and force a byelection, but only if the whole votes to recall it, which the majority whips are always going to be reluctant to do with their own side, or after a member is sentenced to a short prison term. The legislation might have forced out a hypothetical member in a Chris Huhne-type case where, unlike Huhne, an MP was sentenced to a short prison spell but insisted they did not need to resign. It would very likely not deal with a Maria Miller-type expenses case, where the record of parliamentarians to round on their own has been limited. This was really a 2010 election policy but it has new legs with increasing disaffection with mainstream politics. It's already causing divisions within parties: some MPs think it goes too far, others who campaigned for it say it that it has been watered down. This provisionally provides for direct elections to the national park authorities. In the sparsely-populated regions of England that form national parks, decisions made by these authorities are important, not only to the relatively few citizens but to millions of visitors too. But their budgets are tiny, and after the derisory turnout for directed-elected police commissioner elections, there must be doubts that the electorate particularly wants to vote on anything else, and particularly on anything smaller. only of interest to that rare breed of voter that likes nothing more than voting, and wants even more opportunity to do so more often. Seeing as these are types that generally know how they want to vote anyway, the will be no effect on 2015, unless the opposition can use this as an example of pointlessly costly coalition reform. Several bills are carried over from the previous parliament including the (clarifies various protection for shoppers – sets out what to do when goods, services or digital content do not meet standards and clarifies when terms and conditions can be considered unfair), the (which covers question of knife crime sentences, where the Lib Dems have been fighting back over Conservative demands for mandatory jail). There is a , to provide for easier repeal of outmoded regulations, last year's attempt to deal with red tape, before this year's ""small business"" bill described above. A a (implementing the residue of past budgets), and , which sets up the new north-south high-speed railway. The latter is complex, and probably will not pass before the election. most of this is real tidying-up stuff, but a couple will serve political purpose. The Conservatives will be perfectly happy to see the legislation that sparked the knife crimes row rumble on into election year, because theirs is a populist argument which they will be keen to keep having in the run-up to polling day. HS2 is deeply controversial in affected constituencies, and its presence in parliament could be provocative there, although many of these are in Tory strongholds like Buckinghamshire it may have little effect on who wins in the end. The bigger consequence of this legislation remaining live right up to the election is the weight it puts on Labour's decision about whether to support of oppose. But where Ed Balls once made a virtue of refusing ""blank cheques"", suggesting Labour could pull the plug, the party has recently sounded more positive, making it less likely it will push HS2 off the tracks before 2015, a move which would create a really huge election divide. These range from the smaller and specific (Charging for plastic bags), which would need to be given effect through amending statute or secondary legislation at some future point, to the big and airy (promising to ""continue to build a fairer society"") which may go nowhere at all. Obscure phrases like ""my government will continue to build an economy that rewards those who work hard"" may be invoked as cover for substantive changes, such as benefit cuts, which could still be effected through regulation at some later stage. at this stage of the political game, ministers want to talk up popular things even if they are not clear exactly what they do when. If they come up with bright ideas later, they can point to the right ambiguous phrase in the Queen's Speech to pretend it was always part of the plan. And even if they promise something they can't deliver they're not too worried – they can say they tried their best but the , the opposition, their coalition partners or the clock meant it couldn't quite be done. All of which strengthens the real argument – ""vote for me!"". And which, the Queen said, would ensure that ""future governments spend taxpayers' money responsibly"". This is a classic George Osborne wheeze, which reveals that the chancellor is not a Conservative at all in constitutional matters. One tenet of the parliamentary sovereignty that Eurosceptic Tories emphasises is that ""no parliament can bind its successor"", which it is impossible to square with this supposed guarantee of future prudence? the real game, of course, is not to answer this question, but to instigate a series of votes on spending totals which will, supposedly cause red faces on the red benches, by forcing Labour to decide whether to vote through (and therefore endorse) Osborne's future fiscal plans, or whether instead to vote against him, allowing him to paint them as soft. An immigration bill. Legislation creating a ban on wild animals in circuses, which had been widely trailed and expected."
883	884	Nick Clegg embroiled in row over government's new recall bill 	"Nick Clegg is at the centre of a row over the government's new recall bill, after he claimed the thwarted his efforts to make it easier to kick misbehaving MPs out of their jobs. The deputy prime minister said he would have liked to make the legislation stronger and had ""personal sympathy"" with the idea of letting voters boot out their MP without parliamentary permission. But he said Tory ministers ""would not have touched this with a barge pole"". This provoked fury among the main supporters of recall – a group of Tory backbenchers – who accused Clegg of peddling ""bullshit"" and being the architect of the current bill, which they believe is too weak to be effective. Under the current plans, the bill would only let voters trigger a byelection if their MP has gone to jail or has first been censured by his or her fellow MPs in the . Activists would then need to collect signatures from 10% of the MP's constituents. Lib Dem sources said the Tory leadership was worried it would not get the support of their backbenches if recall was purely in the hands of voters – without a vote in the Commons first. That could lead to a rebellion similar to the one over Lords reform. Clegg's party has previously accused David Cameron of blocking the bill, even though it was part of the coalition agreement. However, Zac Goldsmith, the Tory MP for Richmond, said Clegg was entirely responsible for the bill, which is a ""disgrace even by the standards of modern politics"". Douglas Carswell, Conservative MP for Clacton, said Clegg's claim of strong support for recall was disingenuous. ""If I can be blunt, it's bullshit and he knows it,"" he said. ""It's straightforward deceit and he has said this simply for effect. The truth is that on the Conservative backbenches there is strong support. Where there is kickback it's coming from people holding red boxes and people in the Cabinet Office. I wouldn't hold it against Clegg if he opposed he idea, but what's absolutely unforgivable is that he opposed it but pretends to be in favour."" Around 19 MPs – including the prominent Tory David Davis, Lib Dem Julian Huppert, Labour's Kate Hoey and the Green party's Caroline Lucas – have now signed Goldsmith's new parliamentary motion arguing that voters should be given the right to decide on recall. However, the issue is emotive for MPs in the wake of the expenses scandal. Recall is regarded warily by those responsible for party discipline as there is a worry it could lead MPs to be more rebellious if they are too fearful of their constituents. A number of backbenchers are also concerned about its implications but few have raised objections publicly for fear of antagonising their constituents at a time when public trust in politicians is low."
885	886	Eric Joyce stripped of Labour whip after allegations of Commons assault 	"Labour MP and former army major Eric Joyce has been charged with three counts of common assault and stripped of the party whip after being detained by police following reports of a disturbance in a bar. Joyce, the MP for Falkirk, spent the night in Belgravia police station after he was arrested and removed from the Strangers' Bar on Wednesday evening. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ""We were called at approximately 10.50pm last night to reports of a disturbance at a bar within the House of Commons. A man aged in his 50s was arrested by officers on suspicion of assault."" A Labour party spokesman said: ""This is an extremely serious incident. We have suspended pending the results of the police investigation."" John Bercow, the speaker, made a special statement about the incident in the Commons on Thursday morning. He told MPs: ""Members will be aware of reports of a serious incident in the house last night. I have been informed by the serjeant at arms that [Eric Joyce] has been detained in police custody. ""The matter is being investigated. I take this matter very seriously, as do the house authorities. I ask that no further reference should be made to these reports in the chamber today."" Ed Miliband removed the whip from Joyce amid allegations that he struck at least four MPs, including a whip. Joyce is alleged to have headbutted and punched the Conservative MP Stuart Andrew. In response to a tweet asking how he was, Andrew replied: ""Thank you. I am OK."" Alec Shelbrooke, the Conservative MP for Elmet and Rothwell, was also reportedly caught up in the fracas after he urged Joyce to calm down. Phil Wilson, a Labour whip who is responsible for party discipline, is said to have been struck when he tried to calm the situation. Jackie Doyle-Price, the Conservative MP for Thurrock, is also understood to have intervened. Joyce was handcuffed and led away by security officers. The incident occurred shortly after a delegation of Canadian parliamentarians, including Canada's speaker, had been drinking in the bar. Andrew was in the bar after an event organised for the Canadians by his colleague Andrew Percy. Joyce, who was first elected as MP for Falkirk West at a byelection in December 2000, served in the army medical corps before he embarked on a political career. He was suspended from the army in 1998 after writing a Fabian pamphlet that accused the army of snobbery. Joyce served as an aide to a series of ministers between 2003 and 2009. But in 2009 he resigned as parliamentary private secretary to the then defence secretary Bob Ainsworth amid unease at the number of military deaths in Afghanistan. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ""Eric Joyce, aged 51, an MP of Union Street, Bo'ness, West Lothian has been charged with three counts of common assault following an incident within the House of Commons on Wednesday 22 February. ""He will appear on bail at West London Magistrates' Court on 7 March."""
892	893	GSK boss says firm won't pull out of China despite corruption scandal 	"The boss of insists the pharmaceutical giant will not pull out of China despite a lurid corruption scandal that has wiped out two-thirds of its business in the world's second-largest economy. GSK, one of the UK's largest blue-chip companies, reported that sales in the fast-growing Chinese market had dropped by 61% since July as buyers ditched its medicines and vaccines. GSK is with cash and prostitutes in order to sell its products. Sir Andrew Witty, GSK's chief executive, said the company had no intention of scaling back in China. ""There is absolutely no question about our commitment to ,"" he said. ""Even with this decline in sales this is still a multi-hundred million pound business. This would still be at these levels of reduction a very significant European-sized country business."" Witty was speaking as the pharmaceutical company unveiled its results for the third quarter, which revealed that global sales grew modestly at 1%. He said media comments had led to sales dropping across GSK's portfolio of products. ""The bottom line is that just simply the media in China, the commentary in China has created an anxiety, which has led to some disruption in the business."" The Chinese state news agency Xinhua went on the attack last month, saying that the corruption scandal had been orchestrated by senior executives at GSK China, at odds with the defence of ""bad apples"" in the sales department that GSK had suggested. Witty declined to comment on the allegations in detail until the investigation is concluded. ""The activities described by the authorities are very serious and totally unacceptable. They are contrary to our values and to everything I believe in. We very clearly recognise there is a profound need to earn the trust of Chinese people again. We will take every action to do so. ""We continue to fully co-operate with the authorities and respect the progress of the investigation. As such there is very little further I can say."" He said it was too early for the company to make decisions on setting aside money for fines or to assess the long-term damage to its China business."
895	896	Grangemouth union offers to guarantee no strike action in return for talks 	"Unions at Grangemouth oil refinery would happily agree not to strike until the end of this year in return for employers reopening talks about workers' future conditions, the Scottish secretary of the union said on Friday. Pat Rafferty's comments came after Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, called for a ""truce deal"" between unions and the refinery's operator Ineos, which has shut down the plant on safety grounds in the face of threatened industrial action. Ineos director Tom Crotty said the company would be ready to reopen the complex on the Firth of Forth if it received formal assurances from Unite that there would be no strike between now and the end of December. The union has called off a 48-hour strike planned for Sunday. Rafferty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We would happily sign up to having no more strikes until the end of the year. ""We will enter happily into an agreement right now that will take us to Christmas, where we will have no industrial action and no ballots. In return for that, all we ask the company to do is sit down with us at the negotiating table over the next 45 days and look to try and seek agreement. ""The plant should be turned on. There's no reason right now why that plant shouldn't be turned on, because there's no industrial action."" Rafferty said the same offer had been on the table at recent talks at the conciliation service Acas, but that Ineos walked away and moved to impose ""detrimental terms and conditions"" on workers. Asked whether Ineos could reopen Grangemouth in response to the Unite offer, Crotty told Today: ""Of course we can. If we get the assurance, we will switch the plant on. If we get that formally, then that's great."" He added: ""What we are trying to do right now is talk to our employees about the urgent changes we need to make to this site. ""We have a business that's losing £10m every month. We've put £1bn into that business. We need to put another £300m into it to get it sorted out, to build a new terminal that will allow us to bring new sources of gas in, because the gas in the North Sea is running out. ""If we don't do that, that site will close. By 2017, it will not exist. That's a disaster for that we are desperately trying to avoid. We're working to save this site. To do that we need our employees to help. That's what we are talking to our employees about right now."" Ineos released a statement later on Friday confirming it would restart the Grangemouth site if it received a guarantee that there would be no further industrial action during the 60-day consultation period on the the firm's survival plan for the site. Calum Maclean, Grangemouth's chairman said: ""We have been very clear that for compelling safety reasons, we cannot restart the site until we know that the risk of further industrial action has been removed. We can confirm that we would restart if there was a clear guarantee that there would be no further action during the next 60 days. This would allow us to complete a full consultation process with our employees on the changes that the site so urgently needs."" Ineos had previously said it was keeping the plant shut while workers are consulted about proposed changes to issues such as pensions. Letters have been sent to Grangemouth workers detailing changes to their terms and conditions, including ending their final salary pension scheme, freezing pay and bonuses, reducing shift allowances and new agreements with unions including having part-time conveners. The letter said: ""We expect to seek individual employee agreement to the final changes, and, where agreement is not forthcoming, to implement the changes in due course by issuing notices of termination and offering new contracts of employment to those employees which incorporate the new terms."" Unite said staff had been told to accept the new terms and conditions by 6pm on Monday, which amounted to a ""sign or be sacked"" ultimatum, and that it was considering legal action. Ineos said it was going directly to the employees rather than deal with their union amid fresh clashes over the company's finances and its decision to close the plant. The Grangemouth refining and chemicals complex has been shut down twice in the last 40 years, during a previous strike in 2008 and again in preparation for the latest walkout, according to Ineos."
897	898	Grangemouth stays shut as owner and workers fail to agree 	"Hopes of reopening the Grangemouth oil refinery were dashed after its owner, Ineos, and the Unite union failed to reach agreement in talks spurred by Scottish secretary . Scotland's biggest oil refinery remains shut despite Ineos's offer to restart it if agreed not to strike for the rest of this year. Ineos closed the site on Wednesday and demanded that workers accept drastic changes to their employment terms. Ineos said Grangemouth would stay closed at least until Tuesday, when bosses will review workers' response to their demands. It has warned that permanent closure is an option. Unite said that it had agreed not to strike, but Ineos had to remove the ""sword of Damocles"" deadline of 6pm on Monday for workers to accept the new terms. Talks encouraged by Salmond between Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean and Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty broke up on Friday morning. Salmond told the BBC's Good Morning programme: ""I set out as a proposal what both sides have indicated they are prepared to do, something that would allow the plant to get from its current cold state back up into safe operation, which I think would be a fundamentally better background in which to conduct negotiations and consultation."" Employing 3,400 permanent and contract staff, Grangemouth supplies most of Scotland's fuel. Prolonged closure could spark panic at petrol pumps and damage the country's economy. Ineos's demands include abolishing Grangemouth's final salary pension scheme, freezing wages and scrapping bonuses until 2017 as well as cutting shift allowances, overtime pay, holidays and redundancy terms. Ineos has bypassed Unite to offer one-off payments to workers who agree to the new terms by Monday's deadline. Unite said the offer was designed to cause fear and called on Ineos to restart talks. Ineos said Grangemouth's fate was urgent and that Unite had been more concerned with the fate of a suspended official, Stephen Deans, than the plant's future. Ineos has said Grangemouth is losing £10m a month and the workforce will have to accept changes for a planned £300m investment plan to be viable. Unite has asked HMRC to investigate Swiss-based Ineos's tax affairs."
906	907	Eric Joyce gives up Labour membership after bar brawl 	" has tendered his resignation as a member of the Labour party and apologised to colleagues for a bar brawl in parliament. The MP for Falkirk was suspended from the party last month following a fight in a bar on 22 February in which a Conservative MP was headbutted and punched. He had already said he would at the next general election in 2015. The 51-year-old former soldier, who at Westminster magistrates court last week to four counts of assault, told the House of Commons he ""had a number of personal issues to address"". Joyce was charged with assaulting the Conservative Stuart Andrew shortly before closing time at the Strangers' bar, which is open to MPs and their guests. He also attacked the Tory councillors Luke Mackenzie and Ben Maney before turning on the whip Phillip Wilson. The court heard that he told police: ""You can't touch me, I'm an MP."" Magistrates fined him £3,000, ordered him to pay £1,400 in compensation and gave him a 12-month community order. They also banned him from entering any bar, pub or restaurant for three months and imposed a curfew order from Friday to Sunday. In a personal statement to the Commons, Joyce said his behaviour had ""fallen egregiously below what is required"" by an MP ""or indeed anyone anywhere"". He apologised ""without any reservation"" to the people he attacked, to police officers, to his constituents and to anyone else affected by what he hade done. He thanked those he assaulted for responding in public with ""considerable grace"". He said: ""Clearly I have a number of personal issues to address. This will take place."" Joyce later wrote to the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, and to Johann Lamont, MSP and leader of the party in Scotland, to resign from the party membership and offer an ""unreserved and heartfelt"" apology. ""It is clear that my conduct on 22 February fell far below the high standards of an elected representative of the Labour party and I therefore, with great sadness, wish to submit my resignation as a party member,"" he wrote. He said he would continue to ""support the aims of the Labour party and will work hard to support them in any way I can"" during the remainder of the period he has been elected to serve the people of Falkirk."
908	909	Nick Clegg eager to underscore his party's influence on Queen's speech 	"A battered Nick Clegg will make a concerted effort to claim that Wednesday's shows the clear influence of his party, pointing to tax-free childcare for parents who work, two pensions bills, reform of the pub industry and an electors' right to recall corrupt MPs. It is also expected he will be able to claim that plans for another immigration bill have been seen off, although some of the proposals mooted for such a bill can be introduced through regulations. The Liberal Democrat chief whip, Don Foster, has been one of many senior anxious to ensure that the final, potentially rocky, session of parliament does not collapse into acrimony as the two wings of the coalition abandon legislation in favour of intra-coalition in-fighting . The final session of a fixed-term parliament is uncharted territory, and there had been fears that Liberal Democrat MPs would call for an end to the coalition in the final 10 or so months of the government. Although calls for a break-up of the coalition have not surfaced, there is the threat of repeat rebellions. Research published by Revolts at the University of Nottingham showed out of the 68 post-war sessions before the 2013-14 session there were just six that saw a larger number of rebellions by government MPs. The temptation will be for MPs in marginal seats in the final session to assert their independence and impress their constituents. With his personal and party ratings hitting record lows in some polls this week, Clegg needs to convince Lib Dem supporters that being part of the coalition is still worthwhile. A poll for the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed the Liberal Democrats nationally on 6% and probably on course to lose their deposit in the Newark byelection on Thursday. Clegg is expected to point to free childcare for families where both parents work, worth up to up to £2,000 per child, an issue on which the Liberal Democrats have repeatedly demanded changes. The Lib Dem pensions minister, Steve Webb, will also champion two bills, including one implementing the changes laid out in the budget, and then at the weekend the introduction of Dutch-style collective pensions. These are being described as the two biggest bills of the parliament, and testament to Webb's expertise. Clegg will also introduce long-awaited reforms designed to introduce a limited form of recall for MPs if they have been found to have broken the Commons code of conduct by the standards committee. The measure has been bogged down in coalition in-fighting with some radical Tories, such as Zac Goldsmith, claiming the initial version of the proposal was woefully weak since it does not give constituents a right to initiate the recall of an MP, but has to wait for the standards committee to condemn the MPs behaviour. Details of the new bill are not expected on Wednesday. After years of controversy, the business secretary, , will introduce legislation to regulate pub chains, including a statutory code of conduct and a new regulator with powers to arbitrate between pub companies and their tenants. It is expected that the code will not include free-of-tie and market-rent-only options, the proposal made by the business select committee in successive inquiries and supported by the Liberal Democrat backbench MP Greg Mulholland. A recent survey found that 84 per cent of landlords tied to buying beer from the pubCos earn less than £15,000 per year. Cable is also expected to table plans to make company ownership more transparent, plans first laid out by David Cameron during his chairmanship of the G8 last year. The Liberal Democrats will also maintain their opposition to a bill guaranteeing a referendum on EU membership in 2017. A private member's bill piloted by backbench Tory MP James Wharton died in the Lords in the last session, and it is expected that another Tory backbencher will retable the bill. David Cameron has vowed that if this is the case, he will use the Parliament Act to force the bill through the Lords in the coming session, but the Liberal Democrats believe they can stop the prime minister using the act in that way. Clegg's aides have described such threats by the prime minister as ""a bit of bluster"". The Liberal Democrats are going to have to swallow an unpalatable infrastructure and fracking bill. The legislation will enact government plans to give the Highways Agency more commercial freedom by turning it into a government company (Go-Co) and make changes to the planning system to speed up development. It will also reform the trespass laws to make it easier for companies to exploit gas reserves under privately owned land in defiance of owners' objections. The measure is likely to be one of the most controversial of the parliament. Liberal Democrats do not oppose fracking in principle, but argue that it is wrong to treat it as a short-term answer to the UK's energy needs. Apart from bills carried over from the previous parliament, including the bill paving the way for HS2, it is expected that there will be extra legal protection for people people carrying out good deeds, volunteering or planning local events who end up being involved in liability claims."
909	910	GlaxoSmithKline to publish clinical trial data 	", Britain's biggest pharmaceutical company, has become the world's first drug major to commit to publishing clinical trial data in a move that campaigners hope will increase the likelihood of medical breakthroughs and protect patients from ill-advised prescriptions. GSK's decision to publish the results of all drug trials comes . The allegations included a failure to reveal two scientific studies that challenged the efficacy of prescribing Paxil, known as Seroxat in the UK, to children. The company's commitment to data transparency follows a high-profile campaign led by , a doctor and Guardian columnist, who helped expose drug companies' manipulation of clinical trial data. GSK said it will ""publish CSRs [clinical study reports] for all of its medicines once they have been approved or discontinued from development and the results have been published"". It will eventually lead to the publication of all trial data dating back to the formation of the company in 2000 when Glaxo Wellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham. Patrick Vallance, GSK's president of pharmaceutical research and development, said: ""We are committed to being transparent with our clinical trial data to help advance scientific understanding and inform medical judgment. All those involved in the conduct and publication of clinical research, whether healthcare companies like GSK, academia or research organisations, have a role to play in ensuring that the data they generate are made publicly available to help bring patient benefit."" The company said it would publish CSRs for clinical outcomes trials for all approved medicines dating back to the formation of the company in 2000. In a speech last year that paved the way for the move, GSK's chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, said opening clinical trial data to a wider audience would help find cures for diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis as well helping develop novel antibiotics. Goldacre said GSK's decision to publish CSRs rather than just summary results and academic journal articles was a ""genuinely historic"" milestone for the future development of medicine. He said that pharmaceutical companies' refusal to publish all the data has ""harmed patients"" because it means doctors only have access to some of the information. ""Trials with positive results are twice as likely to get reported as negative results,"" Goldacre said. ""You can't make informed decisions about which treatment is best for the patient on the basis of just half the results, especially as it's the unflattering ones that are withheld."" Goldacre, who , said he met Witty to discuss his on Friday. He said he expected GSK's decision would put ""huge pressure"" on the world's other big pharmaceutical companies to commit to publishing their own trial data. ""Withholding this data is utterly indefensible,"" he said. ""It is the 21st century equivalent of bloodletting. It's insane."""
910	911	Nick Clegg gives ground in coalition row over green energy levies 	" has opened the door to a possible resolution of the coalition dispute over energy prices, saying he is willing to see the burden of some of the green levies shifted to general taxation and away from energy consumers' bills. had stunned the Liberal Democrats by announcing he was going to roll back the environmental levies, giving Nick Clegg 30 minutes' notice of his plan to make the announcement at Wednesday's prime minister's questions. But Clegg's aides noted that schemes to help the fuel-poor, such as the Warm Home Discount scheme worth £135m to two million poorer customers, would be more progressive if funded by general taxation rather than a flat levy on consumers. Referring to the Warm Home Discount, Clegg said: ""We could perhaps fund that through general government expenditure, rather than through one of those levies, but one way or the other we do need to help those two million families with their fuel bills. I do not want to turn our backs on the poorest in society. I don't want to turn our back on the environment."" Clegg's comments came as Scottish Power became the fourth of the big six energy firms to raise prices – this time by 8.6% or an average of £113 for dual-fuel customers. Gas prices will rise by an average 8.5% and electricity 9%, with the company blaming some of the rise on levies. Clegg's aides suggested it would be a struggle to reach agreement on all the levies ahead of the autumn statement in December, since the multibillion-pound cost means a simple transfer of the whole cost to the taxpayer would blow a sizeable hole in the government's finances. The Lib Dems also believe some levies are best left funded as at present. Lib Dems have long said the carbon price floor, a tax on fossil fuels introduced in April by the chancellor George Osborne, is the least green of the many levies, as well as being reviled by industry. But it is set to raise £4bn over three years for the Treasury, making its abolition highly expensive. The electricity industry wants the reform of the Companies Obligation, which supports energy efficiency in poorer households and is due to cost £2.5bn. There is a dispute about whether the industry is exaggerating the cost of implementing the scheme designed to improve home insulation. Clegg continued to insist that many of the levies would reduce bills in the medium term by making homes more energy efficient. Energy secretary Ed Davey said the big six energy firms would pay for the price hikes by losing market share. He said: ""With 15 independent energy suppliers to choose from outside the big six, it's surprising that these companies think they can keep getting away with bill hikes of this magnitude. As more and more people shop around for the competitive deals on the market, some of which are offered by the independents, companies like Scottish Power can no longer put their bills up in this way with no consequences."" David Cameron, speaking in Brussels, said switching energy suppliers can help people [save] up to £250. ""We've also got to look at the taxes and charges and things that are added to people's bills to see if we can reduce the cost of those."" Labour said it was willing to consider some green levies being switched to general taxation, but said the priority was the behaviour of the energy companies. Ed Miliband said: ""Yesterday, in weakness and panic, the government made up a new policy on energy. Today, Nick Clegg has revealed their true intentions: to shift the burden from ordinary bill payers like you to ordinary taxpayers like you. ""Governments have always looked at this balance, but this government wants you to pick up the tab for its failure to stand up to the energy companies … They propose a panicked wheeze paid for by taxpayers. We offer a real freeze paid for by the big energy companies."" Clegg revealed his office had been given as little as 30 minutes' notice that Cameron was to announce a rolling-back of the green levies. Discussions within government had been confined to stress-testing the levies for efficiency, not rolling them back, he said, adding that he was still not clear what Cameron precisely had in mind. He added: ""There was a new theory on the right of British politics that it is all the fault of us caring about the environment."" In a sign of the political difficulties for the government as winter sets in and the electricity price rises bite, the government will set out on Friday advice on how to keep energy bills down. The Cold Weather Plan for England says people should keep homes warm, with living-room temperatures of 21C (70F) and bedrooms, and the rest of the house heated to 18C (65F). It says temperatures above these ""may waste money"" but anything below them ""may risk your health"". If people are unable to afford to heat all their rooms, it suggests they should heat their living room during the day and bedrooms just before going to bed. The plan was published by Public Health England (PHE). It claims there are over 24,000 avoidable deaths each year in England and Wales. The causes are complex, ""interlinked with fuel poverty, poor housing and health inequalities, as well as circulating infectious diseases, particularly flu and norovirus, and the extent of snow and ice,"" it added."
913	914	Ed Davey interview: 'I'm not going to give up on renewable energy' 	"t began with the announcement of the first new nuclear power station in Britain for decades and ended with frantic efforts to save Scotland's Grangemouth petrochemicals plant. In between John Major called for a windfall tax on energy profits and David Cameron responded with a promise to cut green taxes, leading to a coalition row. It sounds a dreadful week. But Ed Davey is feeling ""bullish on a number of fronts"", a member of his staff tells me as I arrive at the Department for and Climate Change to meet the Liberal Democrat secretary of state. Davey has much to prove. His promotion to the cabinet in February last year looked awkward, forced as it was by Chris Huhne's resignation. Outside parliament, Lib Dem party circles and his Kingston constituency, he was barely known, and he lacks both the smooth, television-friendly manners of a Cameron or Clegg, and the heft brought to parliament by those with a previous career (Davey got a job with the a few months after leaving university). Huhne, seen as a formidable bulwark against the climate-sceptic Tory right, was a hard act to follow. The resurgence of what Davey calls the ""Tory tea party tendency"" is linked by some to Huhne's retreat. But Davey, highly regarded by the Lib Dems for the work he did under business secretary Vince Cable on the privatisation of the Royal Mail, knows he's tough. He was orphaned at 15, and a carer for his widowed mother before that. If his path through an elite education to government was the typically smooth ride of the modern career politician (private school, Oxford college, job as a party researcher), family life was not, and in 2007 his first child with wife Emily Gasson, John, was born with serious disabilities. Davey spoke about his difficulties getting the right treatment for his son at last year's party conference, and said bereavement had made him resilient. In 1995 he won two awards for bravery after coming to the rescue of a woman pushed on to the track in front of an approaching train at London's Clapham Junction. ""I'm enjoying my job very much,"" he says when I ask if challenging personal experiences have made him harder than many of his colleagues. ""I think people are surprised I am winning so many battles all the time,"" he says. ""What I saw in my first year as secretary of state was a danger that if Britain didn't lead the way on climate change nothing would happen. I thought: If I don't lead, no one else is going to."" But if Davey is determinedly upbeat, seeing a ""rosy future"" for Grangemouth now the industrial dispute has been settled and not dwelling on workers' lost rights, others look on this week as yet another defeat for the Lib Dems, once as fierce in their defence of the environment as they were in their objections to foreign wars and tuition fees. The coalition agreement promised ""no public subsidy"" for nuclear. The Hinkley deal allows billions of pounds to be paid to French company EDF, as well as loan guarantees. Now he says, ""I struck a very tough, tough bargain with EDF – I was the toughest in government, others would have signed a lot earlier. I refused to sign. I wanted to make sure we got the best deal for the consumer, and transferred all the construction risk from the consumer to the developer, which has never happened before."" Scroll forward 48 hours from Monday's announcement to the prime minister promising in the House of Commons to ""roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills"", and it's like a green bad dream. , still in jail in Russia six weeks after being captured during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic. Why isn't the government doing more to help? Last week German chancellor Angela Merkel called Vladimir Putin, even though no Germans are involved. ""We're in contact with them and providing consular assistance,"" says Davey. Born on Christmas day in 1965, is descended from Nottinghamshire miners. His father, a solicitor, died when Edward, the youngest of three boys, was four. His mother, a teacher, developed cancer in his early teens. After her death he lived with his brothers and grandparents and became head boy at the fee-paying Nottingham High School, where Ed Balls was in the year below. After a year off when he worked in a pork pie factory and on a French campsite, he took a first-class degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford. A devout believer in markets and competition, Davey shopped around before joining the Liberal Democrats, going to at least one Young Conservative event (""I sat in the corner"") and listening to David Miliband and Stephen Twigg at the Oxford University Labour Club before deciding neither party was for him. Instead he campaigned on environmental issues and helped promote tactical voting in the 1987 general election. Six months after leaving university he answered a job ad in the Guardian and became economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats, studying in the evenings for an MSc in economics. He left to work as a management consultant before being elected at his first attempt, as MP for Kingston and Surbiton, by a majority of just 56 in 1997. His wife was not so lucky. She was a candidate in the same election and has since stood three times against Conservative Robert Walter in North Dorset, coming closest to victory with 40% of the vote in 2005, the year she and Davey married. At the Liberal Democrat conference last month, Davey told the Guardian that if more women are not elected in 2015, , so poor is its record. Just 12% of Liberal Democrat MPs are women, and Gasson, a solicitor, will not be making a fifth attempt to join them in 2015 because she is pregnant with their second child and, Davey says, ""too busy"". Now he is up for a fight. Last month he was reported to have called in cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood after a series of rows with environment secretary Owen Paterson. Paterson wanted to publish a report he had commissioned on how wind farms harm the rural economy. Davey insisted this was straying into the energy secretary's brief. After our interview, another row with Paterson blew up, when Conservative MP Zac . Davey is surely enjoying Paterson's discomfort over this and the chaos surrounding the culling of badgers (last month he accused ). Last year Davey called climate sceptics on Conservative bankbenches the ""Tory tea party tendency"". When I suggest this group has advanced with Paterson's promotion, and George Osborne's declaration that Britain should give up its leadership role on climate change, he agrees ""that tendency"" has not gone away. But is it getting stronger? In July Davey spent the whole of a fending off the suggestion that global warming is a non-urgent problem. Last week, science writer Matt Ridley, who is Paterson's brother-in-law, . But Davey says: ""It has not got stronger, because the Lib Dems are in the coalition fighting for the green agenda on climate change and we are succeeding."" Then there's the fraught issue of energy bills. An enthusiast for detail, Davey gives me a hand-out showing how a 2013 household energy bill breaks down. What he calls ""green taxes"", the 4% of the average £1,267 bill that goes towards subsidising renewables, is shaded green, and he will ""fight like a tiger"" to keep these, he says, before pointing out that this won't be necessary because they won't even be discussed. The portion of energy bills that he and Nick Clegg believe could be paid for instead via general taxation is the 5% that goes on energy-efficiency measures including the Warm Home Discount, mostly for the poor. ""Let's be clear how hard we've fought for this,"" he says. ""The Tories wanted to get rid of fuel poverty targets. I stopped them. We'd be completely daft to get rid of those because what you'd be doing is solving the energy bill crisis on the backs of the poorest. No, absolutely not, won't agree to it, forget it. If that can be funded in a more generous way, then hey, I'm all ears."" Critics of coalition policy point to the for energy, and . Davey prefers to focus on the good news: ""We've had a target for renewable electricity for 2020 of 30%, and I predict we'll beat that target. I don't know if it's going to be by 1%, 2% or 5%, but we're going to beat the 30% target. No one would have thought it but we're already halfway there. The green taxes we have been pushing as Liberal Democrats in this government have been extraordinarily successful and point to an extremely green, clean energy future. They're not being touched and they won't be touched. It's incredibly important for investors that they hear that."" But if Davey has grown accustomed to attacks from the right, as he defends the last piece of ground the Liberal Democrats have left from which to make the case that they are a moderating influence on the Conservatives, he sounds angriest when he talks about ""Mr Miliband"". He can't stand Labour's new 20-month price freeze policy and deliberately echoes David Cameron (told off by the Speaker of the House of Commons this week for calling Miliband a ""con man"") by calling it a ""con"". ""I will bash on about him because he did nothing in government on this. He created the big six. In 2000 there were three generating companies and 14 suppliers – 17 companies – and after Labour's reforms there was the big six. Well, well done! We're having to change that. We've got lots of new generators coming in and we've now got 15 independent suppliers. ""Labour created the monster, we're defeating it. Labour's policy would recreate the monster. Imagine a 20-month price freeze. Wholesale prices on international markets, which I don't think Ed Miliband is claiming he controls, go up by 10%. That's 47% of the bill. If you're a small supplier, you'd go bankrupt. If you're a big company, you'd take it on your balance sheet. Prices go up, small, independent competitors go out of business, the big six is created again. Well done, Mr Miliband! You really understand market economics don't you?"" Davey calls himself a ""zealot"" about tackling climate change. He is also a zealot for markets, and enraged that painstaking efforts at increasing competition between suppliers (Davey buys his energy from Sainsbury's, having switched from EDF, saving himself £240 in June) have been drowned out in a Labour-led chorus of disapproval about gigantic corporations' greed. For Davey the true solution is simple, and comes down to consumer choice. Currently the least likely customers to switch suppliers are the poorest – an ""elderly lady"", he says, ""might be a bit scared"" – so his department is training community energy advisers to help them make up their minds. He even has a tip: ""The leading independent supplier – I won't name them but you can see for yourself - has a deal at the moment where the rate is fixed until April 2015. With British Gas's current price rise you'd save £240."" The supplier is First Utility. But if consumers are the key to fixing the energy market, Davey knows we can't solve the problem of climate change on our own – and here lies his argument with the right. Osborne is wrong: Britain must take a global lead on climate change, and the government must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and its powerful friends. Davey is ""more optimistic than many people"", he says, pointing to the plummeting cost of renewables. He thinks concentrated solar power is the best long-term bet and isn't sure whether another next generation of nuclear power stations will be needed after this one. For now it is part of the ""mixed approach"" he has taken from his chief scientist, David MacKay, whose book Sustainable Without the Hot Air he read two summers ago and sounds like the basis of current policy. As his advisers hustle him off to see the Guardian's photographer, Davey jabs his finger at my voice recorder: ""I am not going to give up on renewable energy. They are not going to touch it, and I am not going to betray the fuel poor. That, for me, is a complete red line. I feel passionate about that."""
915	916	MPs' expenses claims included '£200,000 to heat second homes' 	"MPs have been criticised for claiming £200,000 of taxpayers' money to cover the cost of their energy bills. Some 340 MPs, including ministers, have used the parliamentary expenses system to recoup the cost of heating their second homes, . Bills costing more than £1,000 were submitted by 41 MPs while 78 made claims for £500 in the 12 months to March this year, its analysis found. The claims do not break any parliamentary rules but come at a time of heightened tensions over the spiralling cost of gas and electricity. The Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, a founder of the market research firm YouGov, claimed the most with a bill totalling £5,822.27 to cover electricity and heating oil for his estate in Warwickshire. Alan Duncan, the international development minister, claimed £2,750 for electricity bills and £1,250 in heating oil for his home in Rutland, Leicestershire, while the universities minister David Willetts claimed £2,596. The Labour MP John Mann, who did not claim for his energy bills, told the Sunday Mirror: ""Perhaps the MPs who have submitted the claims should start wearing thicker jumpers. ""There will be people including pensioners who can't afford to heat their homes who will be furious to find out that MPs who can afford to pay them are putting in such high claims. Government ministers are attacking Ed Miliband for proposing to freeze prices but they don't have to worry about the cost because they can put the claims in."" An analysis by the energy industry regulator Ofgem published this week showed that while the retail price increases announced so far this autumn by four of the big six firms averaged 9.1%, wholesale prices had risen by 1.7%, adding just £10 to the average household bill of £600. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, told the newspaper: ""It's disgraceful that well-paid MPs should claim expenses for heating costs at the same time that thousands of families are struggling to pay to turn the oven on to cook dinner for their families. ""These are the same hypocritical MPs who have failed to get a grip on soaring fuel and energy costs, rising food bills and pay freezes."""
921	922	SSE fuels consumer anger as retail profits rise 30% to £410m 	"Scottish and Southern Energy saw a near 30% rise in profits from its retail customers last year, fuelling accusations that the big energy firms are profiteering at the expense of UK households. Under the heading Earning the Right to Make a Profit, from its retail arm in the year to the end of March. The huge rise in profits will cause further outrage among fuel poverty campaigners and householders struggling to pay their bills. It will also heap more pressure on both the government and Ofgem, who have been accused of standing by as the big six suppliers profit at their customers' expense. tried to deflect criticism of its profits, taking out full-page advertisements in newspapers ahead of the results. ""That profit is paying taxes, improving services, investing in the future and creating jobs – all here in the UK,"" it said. But Ann Robinson at uSwitch.com said: ""These profits will be seen as a smoking gun, making it difficult for any supplier to justify last winter's price hikes and the pressure they have placed on consumers. People have been going cold for fear of the cost of turning their heating on – in these circumstances a price cut or a price freeze is the only suitable peace offering and would go some way to helping and reassuring consumers."" Last October SSE, which supplies 9.6m households with gas and electricity, raised domestic energy prices by 9% to coincide with the start of the coldest and longest winter of recent years. The company said on Wednesday that average household gas consumption in the UK rose by 21% last year, while electricity consumption was 5% higher. The retail business helped drive adjusted profits before tax for the group – which includes SSE's networks and wholesale units – up 5.6% to £1.4bn. The company did, however, write down the value of certain investments by almost £400m and was hit with charges related to claims from outages in prior years, while movements in derivative contracts dented profits by around £200m. That left total profits before tax at £601m for the year. SSE upped its full-year dividend by 5.1% to 84.2p. It added that it will maintain annual dividend increases above inflation – as measured by the retail prices index – this year and beyond. Data out on Tuesday showed annual RPI fell from 3.3% to 2.9% last month. SSE was hit by a mis-selling scandal that saw it . The SSE chairman, Lord Smith of Kelvin, said on Wednesday: ""Like everyone else associated with SSE I have no hesitation in apologising unequivocally for the breaches that occurred; but while the breaches were clearly wrong, the response has been absolutely right."" He said the company had reformed its retail operations since 2011 and introduced a sales guarantee to reimburse any losses experienced by customers joining the company.

924	925	Energy firms 'overcharge by £3.7bn a year' 	"Some of Britain's biggest energy companies have been accused of raising households bills for no reason and systematically overcharging customers by £3.7bn a year as they were grilled by MPs over their soaring prices and profits. They were taken to task by Stephen Fitzpatrick, the chief executive of small supplier Ovo Energy, who launched a stinging attack on his larger rivals for being ""the best filibusters in the business"" when it comes to revealing how they make their money. After British Gas, npower, SSE and announced inflation-busting increases in household bills, Fitzpatrick said he ""cannot explain any of these price rises"" as his company is buying gas for 7% less than it was two years ago. The four companies that have raised bills in recent weeks are under increasing pressure to justify their higher prices after figures from the regulator showed that network costs have risen by just £15 since last year, wholesale costs by £10 and green costs by £10. During the hearing MPs criticised the companies' executives for accepting large bonuses while putting up prices year after year and failing in their duties to protect poor households who have to choose between heating and eating. John Robertson, a Labour MP, warned that thousands of people were dying of hypothermia because they could not afford to pay their bills. He dismissed the companies' claims that they do not disconnect customers by pointing out that those who fall into debt are moved on to prepayment meters which in effect force them to ""self-disconnect"". ""The big reason is they die of hypothermia and they can't afford to keep the heating on. By the time you have gone to look for them [after 30 days of no energy] it's too late,"" he said. The four major companies that have raised prices blamed a combination of rising wholesale prices, green levies and network costs for their latest round of £100-plus increases, taking the average bill to £1,315 a year. They said they could cut prices per household by £40 to £60 instantly if the government removed a charge for the ECO – Energy Companies Obligation – scheme to help poorer households cut their energy usage, with E.ON calling it a ""stealth poll tax"" and saying putting it on bills was ""morally wrong"". Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, even called for a competition inquiry into the market to clear the energy firms of any allegations of profiteering once and for all. Cocker also said Labour's promise of a price freeze ""at a stroke has increased the long-term cost of electricity and gas supply in this country"". However, Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, dismissed the claims of the Big Six energy companies as excuses and said he would take action against those that are ""overcharging people and taking advantage of a broken market"" by freezing prices and breaking up the firms if he wins power in 2015. Fitzpatrick said he was ""somewhat confused by looking at the explanations for the price rises over the past three or four weeks because we do not see really the same impact, especially in wholesale commodity prices. ""We buy all of our power and gas on the wholesale market and … the most expensive price we have paid for wholesale gas in the last four years was in May 2011, for the following winter – that was 74p a therm. ""Since then it has been below 72p a therm for this winter, last winter and next winter. We are buying gas for next winter at a current price of 69p a therm."" He laid into for being the ""worst offender"" in terms of offering some of the most expensive tariffs, and British Gas for its tactic of swiftly offering people much cheaper prices when they say they are about to switch supplier. He said the big companies could easily get round MPs' questions with ""very complex, very clever, very confusing answers"", adding: ""You'll never get to the bottom of it."" He added: ""We are all trying to track were the money has gone, and you will never find it."" Some of the big companies offer cheaper fixed-rate deals than Ovo and other small suppliers, but these are only taken up by a minority of savvy customers. Millions of British households are on the most expensive tariffs, which cost up to £150 more – or £3.7bn in total – than the prices that Ovo claims accurately reflect the costs of supplying energy with a 5% profit margin. Sitting next to representatives of E.ON, npower and SSE, Fitzpatrick said it was also ""common practice among several of our competitors that they load the environmental and social obligation costs on to those customers that are less likely to leave. It looks to me like a lot of energy companies, a significant number of the Big Six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any circumstances and then maintaining the illusion of competitive pricing with tariffs targeted towards a very small number of relatively well-engaged customers. ""In the case of npower, which is the worst offender, historically and today the price differential is about 16%, which is about £200. That's more than the increase we have seen."" Turning to his rivals' sales practices, Fitzpatrick complained that ""one in five customers joining today are immediately leaving to go back to the previous supplier because of a win-back inducement that can be up to 15% off the bill"". He said: ""When a customer calls their supplier and says I'm going to leave, they say hold on a moment, we've just found out we can save you £160. British Gas seems to be the most active, with a dedicated win-back team whose sole job it is to call people up and there's a terrible mistake, we've been overcharging you all this time and now we can cut your bill. When this kind of behaviour is allowed to go unchallenged, this ex-monopoly advantage by the Big Six goes unchallenged by Ofgem, we'll never get effective competition."" Andrew Wright, interim chief executive officer of Ofgem, said it was ""absolutely right"" that there should be a debate about its powers to regulate the industry and promised an annual competition review, but his evidence to MPs was cut short by a parliamentary vote in the Commons."
925	926	Laws blames Osborne cuts plan for Tory refusal to back child poverty goals 	"George Osborne's plans to make ""swingeing and excessive"" welfare cuts in the next parliament lie behind Conservative refusals to sign up to new child poverty reduction targets, the Liberal Democrat at the heart of the coalition talks on the issue, has told the Guardian. A new child poverty strategy was published on Thursday, but contained no child poverty reduction targets, despite two years of coalition discussions. Laws said: ""I am disappointed, frustrated and angry at the Conservative refusal to sign up to a new suite of child poverty targets."" He said he could not disclose the precise barrier to agreement but stressed he had worked very constructively with the work and pensions secretary, , over the past two years. Laws said: ""Obviously any party that is considering making swingeing and excessive cuts to the welfare budget in the next parliament would worry about supporting measures that have an income component in either relative or absolute terms."" He added that he did not believe the Treasury was interested in the discussions continuing on the measures since its attitude throughout had been to block relative measures. Laws said as chairman of the Lib Dems' election 2015 manifesto group he wanted to see these targets appear in the party's manifesto. Getting agreement on the issue ought to be a priority in the next parliament because ""this debate is too important to be vetoed by one political party in British politics"", he added. The three measures agreed between Laws and the DWP – but not by the Treasury – were: Retention of the existing relative child poverty target set at reducing the number of households with incomes 60 % less than average earnings Life chances measures including a reduction in the educational achievement gap between children on the pupil premium and wealthier children measured by GCSE grades An entrenched poverty measure targeted at households in absolute poverty for a year or more, and in addition suffering one or more other indicators of entrenched poverty including worklessness, low parental qualifications and family with three or more children. Laws said: ""Very serious work had been done that meant this suite of measures could have been produced and been robust. The problem is that we do not seem to have a serious credible alternative from the Conservatives. I am frustrated and baffled as to why the will not sign up to these measures. ""I am not clear what Conservative policy now is on entrenched poverty, absolute poverty, relative poverty. I don't think it is sensible after we have been in government not to have policies on these matters. It is up to the Conservatives to explain what the would do if they were left to themselves. The targets designed to last many generations would drive policy. ""The fact that the Conservatives have not been willing to agree a set of measures should not mean this debate runs into the sand."""
934	935	E.ON UK profits spark fresh fears over high cost of energy 	"Concern over the cost of energy was renewed yesterday when , one of the six biggest power companies, reported a 26% increase in profits from its UK retail business, after pushing through a 9% increase in bills at the start of last year. Figures published by the company showed that profit margins for the UK domestic supply business over the past 12 months have increased from 2.3% to 4% since the price rise. E.ON made just under £300m in profits from the UK, and its parent group in Dusseldorf reported global profits of £7.7bn. John Robertson, who sits on the House of Commons energy select committee, said the industry regulator, Ofgem, should not have the ""wool pulled over its eyes"" by the E.ON results, and should continue its investigations into excessive profits in the sector. ""E.ON are trying to play down their results,"" he said, ""but the truth of the matter is, they make an absolute fortune from generation in this country and in Europe. And instead of paying out so much to shareholders, they should be trying to make energy affordable for some of the most vulnerable in society."" Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, urged the power company to use its improved domestic result to help householders struggling with their bills. She said: ""E.ON was the last of the big six to raise bills this winter, and its price increase took into account the government's changes to environmental and social levies, which are paid for through household energy bills. However, we urge E.ON to use its improvement in profits to bring down prices for customers this year."" A spokesman for the energy group said it had already used its improved financial results to cushion its customers by keeping the latest bill increase at 3.7%, the lowest of the big six firms' rises. Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON UK, said the 2013 supply profits had been driven by the cold weather at the start of last year and internal cost-cutting, and denied it was the result of exploiting customers. He called on the chancellor to use next week's budget to cut the carbon price floor, a tax on fossil fuels he said would cost British power customers £3bn a year between now and 2020. Cocker said E.ON was helping to deliver ""real help for families and businesses"", pointing to figures showing that as part of government obligations on suppliers it had installed energy-saving measures in more than 100,000 homes in the past 15 months. He added that the company supported the need for a full Competition Commission investigation into the sector, which is already being scrutinised by other regulators."
935	936	Ofgem to unveil biggest ever energy sector investigation 	"The biggest ever investigation into the UK energy market will be unveiled next week by the industry watchdog, , amid public anger over high bills and bad service from gas and electricity providers. An 18-month inquiry into claims of tacit coordination and profiteering will be undertaken by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and could end in the big six firms having their businesses broken up and reduced in scale. Energy has risen up the public and political agenda over the past eight months since Ed Miliband promised that an incoming Labour government would freeze prices, scrap the regulator and force large companies to sell off assets. Ofgem is preparing to start the investigation but will not formally announce it until the end of next week. Caroline Flint, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said she welcomed the additional resources and support the CMA could provide to establish why overcharging, mis-selling and poor customer service had been allowed to go on for so long. ""Just in the last week we've learnt that wholesale prices have fallen substantially this year and yet consumers have seen no reduction to their bills,"" she said. ""This investigation must address problems like this and stop them happening again in the future. ""However, it shouldn't paralyse politicians from taking action now to improve the lack of competition and weak regulation in the energy market, which has resulted in customers getting a poor deal."" At the start of June gas prices for next-day delivery reached their lowest level since September 2010 and were 38% lower than the same time last year, Ofgem has noted. Prices for electricity reached their lowest level since April 2010, and were 23% lower than June 2013. Despite this, the regulator said suppliers including SSE, EDF Energy, Scottish Power, E.ON, npower and British Gas were showing no signs of reducing prices, or explaining to customers why not. Which? said energy firms should not wait for an investigation before changing their ways. The consumer group's executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ""With almost daily reports of poor performance by energy suppliers and falling wholesale prices still failing to be reflected in consumers' bills, a full competition inquiry is the right way to have an authoritative, independent review into how the energy market fails to work in the interest of consumers. ""If an inquiry is to genuinely help to rebuild consumer trust and inject more competition into the market we need to see substantial proposals that will fix the big six. Suppliers that want to do the right thing shouldn't wait for the outcome of the competition authority's work to change their ways."" Ofgem noted in March, after a preliminary review of the sector, that the biggest six firms – Centrica , SSE, RWE npower, E.ON, Scottish Power and EDF Energy – had seen their profits rise from £233m in 2009 to more than £1bn by 2012. The formal investigation could recommend that individual big six members separate their units that generate power from those units that sell it to households to try to make inroads into their 95% market share. Ofgem, alongside the CMA and the Office of Fair Trading, found evidence of ""possible tacit coordination"" in the timing and size of price increases. The watchdog has consulted the industry on its initial findings and promised to make a final decision on whether to instigate a full inquiry by the summer. The referral to the CMA is a blow to the energy firms, which have already seen their share prices hit hard in anticipation of the ground rules changing in future. In public they have welcomed an inquiry because they believe they will be exonerated of any accusations of profiteering or non-competitive actions. Alistair Phillips-Davies, boss of SSE, said: ""Regulators, politicians, customers and SSE all want the same thing: an energy market that not only works for customers, but is also trusted and seen to do so. We welcome any efforts to clear the air."". Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, which owns British Gas, has made similar comments but warned that an inquiry would freeze much-needed investment in energy plants for its duration. Ofgem, which appointed Dermot Nolan as chief executive this year, refused to comment on any referral to the CMA but has in recent weeks shown its resolve to become tougher on the companies it oversees, with the launch of several initiatives. The CMA also declined to comment on the likelihood of an investigation but confirmed it would be able to demand that divestments were made, although it cannot fine companies under market referral rules. This week Which? revealed there had been 1.7m complaints about the big six in the first three months of 2014. Meanwhile unless it improved its customer performance. It also launched a new investigation into the company's prolonged billing problems. This article was amended on 23 June 2014 to correct the terms of the CMA inquiry."
945	946	Iain Duncan Smith faces angry MPs over universal credit 	"The work and pensions secretary, , was accused on Monday of obfuscation, hubris, discourtesy, and sweeping problems with the universal credit system under the carpet in bad-tempered exchanges with the all-party work and pensions select committee. Duncan Smith came to the committee just as it was revealed that Howard Shiplee, the senior civil servant in charge of UC, had been off sick since Christmas with bronchitis, and was only able to take part in conversations on how to reset the troubled IT programme for the universal benefits system through conference calls. Shiplee was hired last May to run the programme, which is the flagship of the coalition's welfare reform programme, after the departure of several previous executives. Duncan Smith accused Labour MPs on the committee of hectoring and interrupting him when they did not like his answers, as Conservative MPs largely boycotted the two-hour cross-examination. At one point, he accused the Labour MP Glenda Jackson of asking incomprehensible questions in a foreign language. The tension stems from the belief of some committee members that Duncan Smith hid failures in the IT system, including publishing the DWP annual report revealing £40m had been written down due to IT failures the day after he gave evidence to the committee on 9 December last year. The MPs are also angry that when Duncan Smith came before the committee in September 2012 he gave no indication that an ""internal DWP red team review"" had in July 2012 revealed serious IT failures. Duncan Smith, referring to the Red Review, said: ""It was an internal review. I don't have to tell the committee everything that happens in the department until we have reached a conclusion in the department."" He added that no policy decision had been taken on how to respond to the emerging problems including over how to protect the security of claimants. Dame Anne Begg, who chairs the committee, said he had been very bullish at the session about UC and it would have been an ideal opportunity to reveal the problems with the timetable. Duncan Smith replied : ""At that stage, we had nothing to tell. I don't accept for one moment we were hiding stuff. This committee cannot run the department."" The committee demanded to know why it had received written evidence in September 2012 saying universal credit was on course. There had been similar misleading answers this year, committee members claimed. Begg suggested this was a deliberate attempt to avoid scrutiny and questioning of the department's failure on universal credit. ""You can imagine why some people are a bit suspicious that this is a department attempt to sweep things under the carpet,"" she said.  But Duncan Smith dismissed this accusation: ""I don't think so because if it was a carpet it was a very public carpet and we were all under in that case. ""The truth is we weren't sweeping anything under the carpet because I suspect this has been one of the most detailed and forensic reviews that probably has ever been done by something run by government – it was all in the public domain, we discussed it at great length with the NAO [National Audit Office] and all accounts were published directly and signed off by the NAO."" Another Labour MP Debbie Abrahams accused him of obfuscation, hubris and smoke and mirrors. She complained he had not replied to her request to meet a former jobcentre whistleblower claiming the DWP was running a culture in which staff were told to sanction claimants so as to get them off benefit. Duncan Smith denied there was any policy issue of sanctions and rejected suggestions he had agreed a new review into how sanctions were being implemented. The DWP permanent secretary, Robert Devereaux, revealed an acceleration in the handing of benefit claims, saying they were being handled in 10 days instead of the previous 16. The number of calls to a hotline had fallen from 4.5m in November 2012 to 2.9m in November 2013, leading to savings of £2bn a year."
951	952	SSE faces Ofgem's largest fine ever of £10.5m fine for mis-selling 	"The activities of large energy suppliers were under the spotlight again on Friday when , the industry regulator, confirmed that it would levy a £10.5m fine on SSE for mis-selling. The penalty, the largest the watchdog has imposed, was levied for numerous breaches of SSE's obligations relating to telephone, in-store and doorstep sales activities. It is the second time in less than two years that the utility has been found guilty of misleading customers on the doorstep and comes just 48 hours after Ofgem announced about their failure to meet energy efficiency targets. In the latest mis-selling case the contraventions involved ""the use of misleading scripts"" by both telesales agents, while also failing to give ""accurate estimates and comparisons to customers"". said it had ""nothing further to say"" about the fine but confirmed it would pay up by the 17 July deadline. When the penalty was first proposed earlier this month, the company said it was ""deeply regretful that breaches occurred and apologises unreservedly to any customers"". SSE pointed out that a large number of the breaches referred to activity undertaken between October 2009 and July 2011 – the point at which SSE suspended its doorstep sales operations in Britain. But the Ofgem confirmation notice also made reference to the fact that in May 2011 SSE was found guilty of ""misleading commercial practice"" in relation to doorstep-selling activities between 2008 and 2009. SSE, British Gas and Scottish Power are among six energy companies that are to become the subject of an investigation by Ofgem into their failure to reach UK carbon reduction targets. British Gas could face a large fine after missing one target by nearly 40%. Meanwhile another of the big six energy companies, npower, is facing the threat of a consumer boycott. More than 170,000 people have now signed a petition in Britain."
953	954	Twelve applications are submitted for every UK apprenticeship 	"The number of apprenticeship vacancies in the UK rose sharply at the start of this academic year but employers are failing to keep up with demand, with 12 applications for every position. Figures from the show 37,410 vacancies were posted online between August and October last year, up 24% on the previous year. Over the same period applications jumped 43% to 461,530. The number of female applicants rose sharply, to 47% of the total, from 43% the previous year. The numbers were welcomed by the government, which has made apprenticeships a flagship policy for young people, (NEET). Skills and enterprise minister Matthew Hancock said schemes allowing young people to learn and earn simultaneously were growing in appeal. But he encouraged more employers to become involved. ""With each online position attracting an average of 12 applications, demand continues to outstrip supply and I would urge more employers to consider how they can take advantage of this available pool of talent and grow their business through apprenticeships."" There was less positive news for the coalition's push to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing and exports. The latest figures suggested that the greatest numbers of both applications and vacancies were in the business, administration and law sectors. The north-east recorded the greatest leap in apprenticeship applications, up 60% on the previous year. That was followed by Yorkshire and the Humber and the south-west (58%). The latest government figures, which cover actual starts on schemes rather than vacancies, showed , up 77% from 2009-10. But those headline figures do not translate into vast new opportunities for young people and the biggest gains were for over 25s. In that period, the number of over 25s on apprenticeships trebled to 392,900. Under 19s on apprenticeships fell to 181,300 and the 19-24 age group saw a more modest 40% rise to 294,500."
958	959	Europe faces a difficult spring, but its to-do list is achievable 	"uring my current trip to , I have been encouraged by the hope and deeper sense of economic and financial calm that has arrived this spring. With risk spreads compressing markedly, the region's financial crisis has been relegated to the history books, and the region is again attracting the interest of foreign investors. Consumer confidence is recovering as well, and businesses are again looking to expand, albeit cautiously. Economic growth has picked up and unemployment, while still alarmingly high, has stopped increasing in most countries. Remarkably, all of this is occurring in the context of a major geopolitical crisis to the east, following what the Financial Times rightly pointed out constitutes "" "". Equally disturbing, Russia's annexation of Crimea has occurred with stunning ease – indeed, simply ""with the stroke of a pen,"" as the FT put it. And neither western Europe nor the United States can even pretend to provide a military counterweight to Russian actions in Ukraine. Yet, rather than disrupt its growing confidence and composure, the Ukrainian crisis has been a catalyst for renewed political co-operation and solidarity within western Europe. It has also fostered closer relations with the US at a time when political leaders face inevitable headwinds in completing historic negotiations on the , aimed at boosting economic ties in a manner consistent with a strengthened multilateral system. Europe badly needs all of this good economic and financial news. The region has only just exited a recession that has devastated many livelihoods. Far too many citizens are still trapped in , while a – any job. The region's ongoing recovery is also good news for a global economy that has yet to rebalance properly and fire on all available growth cylinders. US growth, while edging up, is still below its potential, let alone high enough to offset prior shortfalls. After a short burst, Japanese growth has begun to sputter. And several systemically important emerging economies (including Brazil, China and Turkey) have slowed, while their transitions to new growth models remain incomplete. But Europe's renewed sense of hope and confidence, however encouraging, is not sufficient – at least not yet – to produce appreciable welfare gains for current and future generations. A few things need to happen rather quickly – specifically, over the next several weeks and months – if the continent is to minimise the risk of slipping into another prolonged period of underperformance and additional asymmetrical downside financial risk. Let us start with the immediate geopolitical threat. To put it bluntly, Europe's economy, and even more so the economies of Russia and , is not particularly well positioned to weather a further disorderly escalation of tensions. Enlightened diplomacy needs to replace the cold war-style posturing and rhetoric that have re-emerged. Further escalation would most likely cause the west to impose deeper economic and (critically) financial sanctions on Russia, followed by Russian counter-sanctions that would disrupt the energy flow to Europe. All of this would tip Europe as a whole into recession and renewed financial turmoil. Second, the needs to pivot from financial crisis prevention – an area where it has performed impressively – to striking the delicate balance of supporting growth (and countering currency over-appreciation) without fuelling excessive risk taking. This may well involve renewed experimentation, which would again take many policymakers outside of their comfort zone. Third, with European institutions acting as catalysts, political leaders will need to reinforce efforts to place the eurozone as a whole on a firm footing. This requires complimenting monetary union with deeper political integration, better fiscal co-ordination (where progress has been painfully slow), and . Fourth, at the national level, individual countries need to continue to rebalance their policies with a view to achieving the trifecta of structural reforms, solid aggregate demand and fewer debt overhangs. Finally, anti-establishment parties must not dominate the European parliament elections in May. Most of these parties are committed to greater national isolation and, at least initially, would work hard to halt and reverse recent gains made on regional economic and financial integration. That is quite a to-do list, especially given that it only covers the next few weeks and months. Yet every item on it is achievable, and progress on each would help to ensure that Europe's encouraging spring leads to a bountiful harvest of economic opportunity, growth, and jobs, while reducing the risk of a hot political summer and a more frigid economic winter.

959	960	UK's 25% aid budget rise contributes to record help for developing countries 	"An increase of more than 25% in Britain's aid budget lifted financial help to the world's poorest countries to record levels in 2013. Figures released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that the post-crash slide in assistance came to an end, with aid rising by 6% to $134.8bn (£81bn). Britain's overseas development assistance climbed by 27.8% as the government met the United Nations target of allocating 0.7% of national output to aid for the first time. But the report from the OECD's Development Assistance Committee revealed that help to the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa fell last year. ""It is heartening to see governments increasing their development aid budgets again, despite the financial constraints they are currently facing,"" said the OECD's secretary general, Angel Gurría. ""However, assistance to some of the neediest countries continues to fall, which is a serious concern."" The Paris-based think tank said the signs were that aid would increase again in 2014 before stabilising. Financial help rose steadily from 1997 to 2010 before being cut back as western governments imposed austerity measures. The last Labour government made a commitment to the 0.7% aid target and the pledge was reaffirmed by the coalition, which ringfenced the Department of International Development from spending cuts. The DfID budget was not increased in 2011 and 2012 but rose sharply last year. Britain joined Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates in meeting the UN target. The Netherlands fell below 0.7% for the first time since 1974. Bilateral aid to sub-Saharan Africa stood at $26.2bn (£15.8bn), a decrease of 4% in real terms from 2012. to the African continent fell by 5.6% to $28.9bn. Excluding debt relief, which was high in 2012 due to assistance to Côte d'Ivoire, net aid in real terms rose by 1.2% to sub-Saharan Africa but fell by 0.9% to the continent as a whole."
960	961	Lloyds Banking Group chief António Horta-Osório gets £1.7m bonus 	" has awarded its chief executive António Horta-Osório a £1.7m bonus after declaring itself ""a normal bank"" five years after its bailout. With preparations under way for a sale of the taxpayer's remaining 33% stake, Horta-Osório played down the impact of Scottish independence on the bailed-out bank, which owns Bank of Scotland. The Portuguese banker – who took the top job in March 2011 – was forced to defend his decision to accept the bonus after union leaders called on him to follow rivals at Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays and waive his payout. Horta-Osório pointed to last year's 70% rise in the share price, which allowed the government to sell off part of its stake last September. There are expectations that a further share sale could begin after the annual report is published on 6 March. ""We are ready to proceed,"" he said. ""The market, I think, is ready as well. I came to Lloyds three years ago to fix this bank and help taxpayers get their money back."" He said he had stabilised the bank after its ""quite precarious"" position when he took charge, and declared that Lloyds was now ""a normal bank"". But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady was unimpressed. ""With Lloyds still owing billions to the taxpayer and the amount it has had to set aside for PPI mis-selling rising by a whopping £1.8bn, now is not the time for its chief executive to be taking a multimillion-pound bonus."" Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said the payout to the boss – in a year when staff pay rose 2% and after 35,000 roles had been lost since the 2008 bailout – was a ""kick in the teeth to the taxpayer"". Horta-Osório will receive the £1.7m share bonus only if half of the remaining taxpayer holding is sold or if the share price remains above 73.6p – the breakeven point of the taxpayer bailout – for six months. He will then be required to hold the shares until 2019. A bonus pool of £395m will be shared between 91,000 staff and payouts will average £4,500 per worker. The bank insisted the payout pot had been reduced as a result of the bank's vast bill for compensating customers for mis-selling payment protection insurance – which has now reached nearly £10bn – and for a ""champagne"" bonus culture that potentially encouraged mis-selling. The bank reported a statutory profit of £415m – and a loss of £802m after tax – after being rocked by a £3bn charge for PPI mis-selling. It admitted a week ago that its and former boss Eric Daniels is among those facing a potential clawback of bonuses after the bigger than expected compensation claims. while the underlying profit for 2013 was £6.2bn, double a year ago. Horta-Osório's bonus comes on top of his £1m salary, £500,000 pension contribution and a payout from a long-term incentive plan that could total £2.9m – half the potential sum – when it is formally revealed next month. He has now begun work on a new three-year strategic plan for the bank, which is being forced to spin off its TSB brand under the terms of its bailout, in a move that could signal branch closures. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, which on Tuesday blasted Barclays for paying higher bonuses when profits were falling, said Lloyds needed to be ""sensitive to taxpayer perceptions when making decisions on remuneration and bonuses"". Horta-Osório agreed it was a ""bad principle"" to pay out higher bonuses when profits were down as Barclays had done. Following calls by Ed Miliband to shake up high street banking by create two new players, Horta-Osório said this would be achieved by TSB – to be floated in the coming months – and the separation of Williams & Glyn's from RBS. However, the Lloyds boss conceded that competition was more of a concern in the small business banking market, currently being reviewed by the Office of Fair Trading. The shares closed down 2% at 81.32p. The bank warned last week that it would not be able to resume dividends until towards the end of this year, later than some analysts had hoped. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: ""The statutory losses are heavier than had been assumed and the forward guidance is softer than frothier market expectations"". BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, has set aside $1.1bn (£660m) to cover a possible fine for breaching US sanctions on countries including Iran, the latest bank to take a hit to profit from a legal investigation. Banks across the world are under investigation for a string of alleged misdeeds, including fixing benchmark interest rates and manipulating foreign exchange markets. They are also facing tougher rules in the wake of the financial crisis. This month, Credit Suisse set aside SFr514m (£346m) to cover US investigations, while in January Deutsche Bank blamed legal costs for a surprise quarterly loss. BNP said on Thursday it had set aside the funds after talks with the US authorities, though it said there had been no discussion on the size of any potential penalty. ""We've been doing a retrospective review for several years and we've basically now presented our findings to the U.S. authorities,"" BNP Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil told Reuters Insider TV. Standard Chartered agreed in 2012 to pay $327m (£196m) to resolve allegations that it violated US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma and Libya. BNP shares were down 4.1% to €58.38, the biggest fall on the STOXX 600 Europe banks index. "
963	964	Osborne under pressure as bonuses surge to £35m at bailed-out banks 	"George Osborne is facing calls to explain bonus payouts worth an estimated £35m that have been handed out by the bailed-out and Lloyds Banking Group. The scale of the rewards – including £3m in shares to the new RBS boss Ross McEwan – were announced to the stock exchange as it emerged the European commission is considering a new clampdown on boardroom pay by requiring firms to disclose a ratio for the gap between executive pay and the pay of an average employee. In a move that would emulate the pay structure at the employee-owned John Lewis – where the chairman cannot earn more than 70 times the average pay rate throughout the company – the commission is working on proposals that would force the 10,000 stock market-listed companies across the EU to reveal pay ratios. Any such move would make it possible to compare bosses' pay and highlight any who are paid excessively in relation to their peers. The disclosures by Lloyds and RBS – which in the past five years has now reported losses totalling more than the £45bn of rescue funds pumped in by the taxpayer in 2008 – have further inflamed the row over City pay. It has already been stoked by attempts by banks to side step an EU rule limiting bankers' bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders give the go-ahead. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer for finance, said: ""George Osborne needs to come to the Commons and explain why he is failing to rein in the excesses of the City and turning a blind eye to the bonus bonanza in our state backed banks."" The 11 members of RBS's executive committee, including McEwan, have cashed in long-term bonus plans and been awarded new payouts potentially worth more than £23m. Lloyds, which is 31% owned by the taxpayer, has handed out more than £12m in share bonuses – granted in previous years but due to be paid out now – while the head of its retail bank, Alison Brittain, has cashed in a near £1m buyout award, which she was handed as an incentive to join the bank two years ago. Unlike RBS, Lloyds – – did not make any announcement about new bonuses awarded for 2013. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""Our bailed-out banks remain deep in debt to the taxpayer and have no right to offer such lavish bonuses. Lloyds and RBS need to focus on fuelling business growth, rather than lining the wallets of senior bosses. As major shareholders in both banks, taxpayers rightly expect the government to do more to tackle this culture of greed."" The latest pay disclosures come amid expectations that the industry will soon face scrutiny of the way it treats small business customers. The banks could face a full competition inquiry after the Office of Fair Trading completes its preliminary study later this month. RBS, which is 81% taxpayer owned, shed light on the way the team assembled by McEwan, who was promoted to chief executive on 1 October, is being paid. While the new RBS boss had called on his so-called executive committee because of the , the three newest members have still been awarded bonuses. Rory Cullinan, head of RBS's new ""bad bank"" dealing with sour loans, received £2.5m in shares. Alison Rose, promoted to run the commercial and private bank, took just under £900,000 and Donald Workman, who runs the Asian businesses, £460,000. Those three are part of the 11-strong management team – which includes Mc-Ewan – that was also awarded almost £14m in shares through a long-term incentive plan (Ltip) due to pay out in three years, depending on performance. McEwan but has now been awarded almost £3m in shares through the Ltip. The members of that executive committee also had more than £5m of shares awarded in previous years released to them. RBS pay policy will face further scrutiny when its publishes its annual report. That will provide more details about its pay policies amid expectations that it will hand McEwan an extra tranche of shares in an ""allowance"" to match other banks' response to the bonus cap. Antonio Horta-Osorio, his counterpart at Lloyds who received £7.5m in 2013, was last week , intended to prevent him losing out as a result of the bonus cap, Antony Jenkins of Barclays has been given £950,000 and Stuart Gulliver of HSBC some £1.7m. Sharon Bowles, the Liberal Democrat MEP who chairs the European parliament's influential economic affairs committee, told Reuters that the committee would discuss at its meeting on Monday whether to toughen up the bonus clampdown."
964	965	UK manufacturing sector shrugs off wet weather with February bounce 	"The pace of Britain's economic recovery accelerated in the first quarter, with growth of 0.9% between January and March according to the National Insitute of Economic and Social Research. The think-tank's estimate, based on a forecast of broad based growth across the economy, would mark the strongest quarter on quarter growth since the second quarter of 2010 if confirmed by official figures published at the end of April. The economy grew by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2013. By Niesr's estimate the annual growth rate rose to 3.2% between Janaury and March, the highest since the final quarter of 2007. It said: ""Even though the level of economic output has almost regained its pre-recession peak, a sizeable negative output gap remains. With economic recovery still in its infancy, we do not expect the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee to change monetary policy, via an increase in interest rates, until the middle of 2015."" The building momentum of economic recovery was echoed by the latest official figures from the , which showed heavy rainfall failed to dampen Britain's manufacturing sector in February. Manufacturing output jumped more sharply than expected by 1% to the highest level in more than two-and-a-half years, while the broader industrial production measure, which includes utilities and mining, was up 0.9%. Economists had expected much more modest growth of 0.3% for both measures, with some warning the wet weather may have disrupted activity. The figures provided a boost to the chancellor, who last month highlighted manufacturing and exports as a key priority in the budget as part of the government's wider ambitions to rebalance the UK economy away from a reliance on consumer spending and the financial services sector. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital , said the data was reassuring. ""The latest industrial production figures provide reassurance that the economic recovery has remained strong and broad-based,"" he said. The growth in manufacturing in February was mainly driven by the pharmaceuticals sector, transport equipment, food, drink and tobacco. Manufacturing output was 3.8% higher than a year earlier in February, in the latest sign the economic recovery is becoming more entrenched. Industrial production was up 2.7% on an annual basis. Economists said the data suggested that first-quarter growth overall at least matched the 0.7% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. The first estimate will be published on 29 April. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacuring trade body EEF, said the outlook for manufacturing was strong. She said: ""Output now stands at its highest level in more than two and a half years with companies reporting good trading conditions both at home and in overseas markets. All manufacturing indicators are lining up for a strong first quarter growth rate, highlighting that industry remains a vital cog in the UK's continuing recovery."""
967	968	George Osborne ready to sell taxpayers' stake in Lloyds Banking Group 	"George Osborne has signalled he is ready to start the sell-off of the taxpayer's stake in Lloyds Banking Group, but said he is to consider whether to break up the , in a move that could delay the bailed-out bank's return to the private sector. In his annual speech to City grandees at Mansion House on Wednesday night, the chancellor said he was ""actively considering options for share sales in Lloyds"", in which the government has a 39% stake. Speculation is mounting that a partial sell-off of the state's Lloyds stake could take place within months. But he played down expectations of an immediate ""Tell Sid""-style privatisation, as implemented by the Conservatives for British Gas during the 1980s. Big City institutions are likely to be offered a chunk of shares first as an ""institutional placement is likely to be the most effective way of managing risk and getting value"". He added: ""And for later share sales, we will consider a retail offering to the general public."" The chancellor also used his strongest language yet to signal his confidence that the economy is recovering nearly five years after the banking crisis forced taxpayers to pump £65bn into the two banks. He said: ""We are moving from rescue to recovery. But while Britain has left intensive care, we still need to secure the recovery – and make sure we continue to treat the ailments that brought us low in the first place."" Osborne told leading bankers and City figures assembled at Mansion House that the move to a share sell-off was a sign of this recovery, but he refused to set out a timetable. He stressed that bailed-out banks needed to support the economy through more lending to businesses and that a sell-off must generate an acceptable return for the taxpayer. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Osborne had been forced to ""back down from the foolhardy idea of a pre-election firesale of RBS"". ""This would have meant a loss of billions of pounds to the taxpayer at the current share price,"" he said, urging the government to look at other options for RBS, including splitting its retail and investment banking arms. Balls said the chancellor's comments about the economy would make ""families and businesses think the chancellor is not living in the real world"". Osborne was speaking hours after the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, called on the government to consider an RBS break-up and introduce new rules to jail bankers for ""reckless misconduct"". Both those ideas were embraced by the government on Wednesday. David Cameron told MPs the financial services banking reform bill would be amended to introduce a new criminal offence for reckless misconduct, while Osborne used the cover of the commission's report to change his view on an RBS break-up. Only four months ago he had appeared to reject a break-up, but he said last night that ""with hindsight I think splitting RBS into a good bank and bad bank was probably what should have happened in 2008"". Osborne added: ""That is with hindsight. I wasn't in office. I didn't suggest it in opposition. And I'm not criticising my predecessor [Alistair Darling], who had to act quickly in a desperate situation."" On the 81% stake in RBS, bought for £45bn in 2008 and 2009 to stop the Edinburgh-based bank collapsing, Osborne said the sale was ""some way off"", despite the last week in a move intended to speed up a sell-off. Any privatisation will be delayed by the review to look at whether a ""bad bank"" should be set up to house the Ulster Bank subsidiary and UK commercial property loans granted by RBS before its bailout. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said any steps that could speed up privatisation were worth ""thorough consideration"" but added: ""Ultimately any change to our strategy would need to be in the interests of all shareholders."" Osborne took steps last night that the City regards as essential to kick off an RBS share sale by announcing talks to remove a special share – known as a dividend access share – put into RBS at the time of its bailout that prevents the bank paying dividends. It is estimated that the bank will have to pay the government as much as £2bn to buy the share. External advisers will be appointed to conduct the three-month review of RBS. The chancellor stressed that no more taxpayer money would be pumped into the bank. The review might also be seen as a victory for Sir Mervyn King, who has been calling for a break-up of RBS. In his last speech as governor of the Bank of England, King told the Mansion House audience: ""I welcome your announcement that will be returned to private hands soon. And I very much support your plans for a full review of the structure of RBS."" Banks, he said, needed to make a real contribution to the economy: ""It must be time for decisive action."" King, who will be replaced by Canadian Mark Carney at the end of the month, said there were ""clear signs of recovery in the UK, albeit modest, under way"". But he appeared far less confident about the strength of the economy, saying ""the need to support the recovery remains"". It was also announced on Wednesdaynight that King would receive a life peerage, under rules that allow the prime minister to nominate up to 10 people for life peerages during each parliament. Cameron nominated King for his significant contribution to public service, Downing Street said. Osborne's upbeat language on the economy was a careful attempt to avoid the ridicule that one of his predecessors, Lord Lamont, faced in 1991 after claiming ""green shoots of economic spring"" were appearing in the middle of a recession. Other aspects of the banking commission report were accepted on Wednesday. A study of competition in the small business sector was launched while Cameron also voiced support for the commission's recommendation to force bankers to wait up to 10 years for bonuses. At prime minister's questions Ed Miliband seized on figures from the Office for National Statistics, which showed a 64% increase in bonuses over the past year, to attack the prime minister for giving bankers a tax cut. The cut in the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p was introduced in April. Cameron said bonuses were a fifth of the size they were when under Labour was in power. Miliband retorted: ""He cannot deny the figures I read out to him. He doesn't even know the facts. Bonuses are up so that people can take advantage of his massive tax cut."""
970	971	£20bn black hole in public finances would mean more austerity or tax rises 	"Put away the champagne. Yes, the recovery so far has been stronger than even the most upbeat forecasters were saying this time last year. Yes, the jobs market is recovering. But this pace of upturn is unsustainable and the upshot for the government – the current administration and whoever gets in next May – is a £20bn black hole in the public finances, according to a report in Friday's Financial Times. The problem with recoveries after a deep recession is a lot of the good news peters out rather quickly. The easy gains are made early on and then you are left assessing the irreparable damage that was done by the downturn. And that is the nub of the FT report: grim reading for chancellor as he puts the finishing touches to his 19 March budget. According the FT's analysis of models by the Office for Budget Responsibility, because the government will not be able to rely on economic recovery to eliminate part of the deficit. The FT's economics editor, Chris Giles, has identified the new black hole by focusing on the difference between the actual deficit (the gap between government expenditure and income such as taxes), which is on course to be around £111bn in 2013-14, and the cyclically adjusted deficit (the gap that is left when the peaks and troughs of the economic cycle are taken out of the equation), due to be £85bn this financial year. Osborne had assumed he would need to target the lower figure. As Giles says, the gap lays bare the consequences of Britain's falling productivity. It is a pessimistic outlook for those facing more spending cuts and for governments now having to contemplate tax rises to plug the gap. But the pessimism is entirely warranted if the OBR's own analysis of productivity is to be believed. In its published alongside Osborne's autumn statement in December, the independent forecaster said there were question marks over the sustainability of a consumer-led recovery. But it had even more worrying views on the longer-term picture. The report said: ""Much of the loss of productivity over the recession was structural and will not return even as the economy recovers and the financial system returns to full health. Since it is difficult to explain the abrupt fall and persistent weakness of productivity in the past, it is also hard to judge when or if productivity growth will return to the rate consistent with historical trends."" When economists talk about permanently lost productivity, it is helpful to think about examples. North Sea oil is a good one, says George Buckley, Deutsche Bank's UK economist, who has a fairly downbeat view of the UK's medium and long-term prospects. The UK is producing a fraction of the oil produced back in 1997 and now we need more people to squeeze what is left out of those oil and gas fields. Or take the financial sector, where staff numbers have changed little but there has been a big drop in output since the ruinous impact of the financial crisis. Some of the lost productivity stems from the much discussed drop in investment in the UK economy in recent years. Hopefully, this loss is not permanent. But investment is still down 20% from its peak. In other words, the existing labour force is working with depleted kit. It will be a long road, even if the Bank of England's forecast for business investment to quicken turns out to be correct. Of course, a lot of forecasts would need to be correct for the FT's analysis – and potentially what will be the OBR's analysis later this month – to come true. All forecasters are plugging best guesses into models. But the growing concerns around productivity are entirely valid. There is a very real possibility that ministers who insist on balancing the books over coming years will have to consider yet more spending cuts after years of austerity. Or tax rises. Or both. Neither is politically attractive, particularly with the political debate centred around a cost of living. But with a ring-fenced NHS budget, an ageing population and lower productivity, both look likely. What politicians really need to do for the long-term is find ways to drive up productivity. Britain's and ministers would do well to look abroad for lessons. For Osborne, the grim news on the deficit must be a spur to make this Budget about restoring business investment and the productivity growth that will follow."
971	972	RBS pays out £588m in bonuses despite suffering £8.24bn loss 	" has defended plans to pay £588m in staff bonuses despite suffering an £8.24bn loss in 2013 as it slumped into the red for the sixth successive year. The size of the bank's bonus pool fell 18% from last year but the RBS chief executive, , acknowledged that the issue was ""highly emotional"" as he explained the multimillion pound windfall at the taxpayer-owned institution. ""I need to pay these people fairly in the marketplace to do the job. I do need to make sure we are there or thereabouts and that is all I'm asking for,"" he said. The latest annual loss was caused by £3.8bn of costs for settling litigation and regulatory problems – including £1.5bn extra to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and interest rate swaps in the UK – and £4.5bn of losses on bad assets. The company's shares fell 6.7% to 330.2p in early trading, wiping more than £2.5bn off the market value of a business that is 81%-owned by the taxpayer. McEwan, who took over from Stephen Hester in October, said RBS needed to regain the trust of its customers and the public. ""We happen to be the least trusted bank in the least trusted sector in the marketplace,"" he said. McEwan also announced plans to revitalise the business, including: Refocusing on UK retail and business customers to increase the share of total assets from Britain to 80% from 60%. Shrinking RBS from seven businesses into three: personal and business banking, commercial and private banking, and corporate and institutional banking. Simplifying products for retail and small business customers, including scrapping ""teaser rates"" and 0% credit card transfers. Cutting costs because the bank is ""too expensive and too bureaucratic"". RBS had warned last month that its pretax loss for the year would be about £8bn but investors were shocked by an operating loss of £2.3bn – far worse than the £1.7bn analysts expected. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: ""We currently see no relative or absolute support for RBS' 'frothy' valuation; a correction is due. Sell."" RBS was bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 with a £45bn investment, following a disastrous expansion into risky investment banking and trading. The bank has since slashed those businesses but McEwan said the cuts would go further still so that its markets business served the basic requirements UK and European companies. He declined to put a figure on potential job cuts but he said RBS – which employs 120,000 people – could get out of more businesses that customers did not need after quitting equity capital markets, mergers and acquisitions and structured finance. Bankers' bonuses continue to plague the industry amid public uproar over past misconduct. to £2.4bn. HSBC said on Monday it would increase salaries for its bosses to get around a European union cap on bonuses. McEwan, who has turned down his bonus for 2013 along with his executive team, declined to say whether RBS would ask shareholders, including the government, for permission to circumvent the EU bonus cap this year. ""The board has not opined,"" he said. McEwan replaced Stephen Hester as chief executive after Hester was forced out last year by chancellor George Osborne. At the time, RBS said Hester was leaving because a new boss was needed for the start of privatisation, possibly this year. But McEwan said his plan would take up to five years to complete, casting doubt on the government's ability to sell its 81% stake any time soon. McEwan said any sale was for the government to decide but that he was concentrating on doing what was needed to revamp the bank. ""I'm not saying five years is the time when the government moves. At some point the government would like to get out and our interests are aligned. He said 0% transfers and other introductory rates were ""abhorrent"" and that customers hated them. It was wrong to chase a new customer and ""dump them"" months later instead of giving the best deal to an existing customer. McEwan refused to be drawn on what plans RBS was making for a possible ""yes"" vote to Scottish independence in September. ""This is an issue for Scotland. The people have to decide and the governments will agree and we need to be thinking about the plans around that."" By contrast, to move its base from Edinburgh to London if Scotland leaves the UK. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The chancellor said last year that he wanted RBS to be a bank that is focused on lending to British businesses and families. The plan, announced by Ross McEwan and the board today, delivers that vision and is further evidence of RBS's new management getting to grips with the problems of the past and taking the bank in its new direction."""
981	982	TSB to shut 17 branches before takeover by Spanish banking group Sabadell 	TSB is shutting 17 branches before its £1.7bn takeover by Spanish banking group Sabadell. Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, said the branches that were closing were within 500 metres of another TSB branch and were part of the estate it inherited when it was carved out of last year. Pester added that, of the 631 branches TSB started with, there were 15 locations where two or three branches were “within spitting distance of each other”. Lloyds was forced to spin out TSB under the terms imposed by the EU at the time of its £20bn bailout by the UK taxpayer. TSB was floated . The , although the deal is yet to be completed. Lloyds had originally intended to sell TSB to Co-operative Bank, but the talks were abandoned shortly before problems emerged in the Co-op business. Pester, who intends to stay on after the Sabadell takeover, said: “TSB is starting to fire on all cylinders as we take on the big banks in our mission to bring more competition to UK banking. “While we still have a long way to go in bringing better banking to UK consumers, we’re making real progress. This is reinforced by Banco de Sabadell’s recommended offer to acquire TSB, which is a real vote of confidence in everything we’ve achieved so far and in our potential to succeed further in the future.” He is positioning the bank as a challenger to the big four – Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland – at a time when the Competition and Markets Authority is conducting a review of high-street banking. Pester said the bank had achieved its target of winning more than 6% of all new current accounts and those being switched between banks. Its mortgage business, recently relaunched to sell home loans through brokers, has received £700m of applications. Profits rose from £9m to £34m in the first three months of this year.
982	983	UK's big four banks face extra £19bn in fines, analysts predict 	The UK’s big four high-street banks face another £19bn of conduct and litigation charges by the end of 2016 as they continue to pay the price for past mistakes, according to analysts. The estimates, from ratings agency Standard & Poor’s, are for Barclays, HSBC, the and Lloyds Banking Group. They come on top of £42bn of charges in the five years to 2014. Including other banks, such as Clydesdale, Yorkshire and Co-op, and the Nationwide and Yorkshire building societies, the total cost of the scandals to hit 13 financial firms over the same period amounted to £48bn. Lloyds, which is now less than 20% owned by the taxpayer, has incurred a greater cost than any of its rivals because of mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). Its PPI bill has topped £12bn, taking the bank’s total provisions for such conduct issues to more than £14bn. The total cost of the PPI scandal has reached £26bn, S&P calculated. PPI was intended to insure customers against unforeseen events so debt repayments could be made, but was also “a meaningful source of income for banks’ retail divisions”. The analysts at S&P said: “In general, we think that the worst period for PPI provisions has now passed.” They calculate that provisions for mis-selling interest rate products to small businesses are also coming down. The agency said: “We assume some banks will still incur material investment banking-related litigation charges in 2015, which, depending on timing, may well outstrip retail conduct charges. That said, we assume that 2015 will be the last big year for litigation charges.” Banks have already been hit by fines for rigging Libor and the £3.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets. Barclays, the first to be fined for rigging Libor in June 2012, is yet to agree a settlement for currency markets manipulation, although it . “Looking further ahead, we think that conduct and litigation charges are now ‘a way of life’ for the UK banking industry, and that some form of charge seems probable every year for the larger banks and every other year for the smaller institutions (although not nearly on the scale for PPI),” S&P said. The £19bn estimate for the big four banks in the next two years is less than the £22bn for the past two years and the bill for past errors could start to subside. The extra costs are due to continuing compensation for retail customers but also other issues such as foreign exchange, Libor and money laundering errors of the kind . S&P said that banks were attempting to avoid running up big bills in the future for their current treatment of customers and behaviour in financial markets. It said: “Examples of change from the past include the greater role and measurement of conduct issues within banks’ risk appetite framework, banks’ focus on providing evidence that they are doing the right thing for customers, and changed sales practices that are less aggressive or short-termist in nature. Furthermore, chief compliance officers, often hired from regulators, are now typically executive committee members and report directly to the banks’ CEOs.”
984	985	UK productivity gap with developed nations now widest for 20 years 	"Britain's productivity gap with its main developed country rivals is at its widest in 20 years, following the flat-lining of the economy after the deep recession of 2008-09. International comparisons (ONS) show that output per hour worked in the UK is 21% lower than the average for the other six members of the G7 – the US, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada. The ONS said this was the biggest productivity shortfall since 1992, and that on an alternative measure – output per worker – the gap was 25%. Poor productivity has been blamed for the lack of earnings growth and the squeeze on real incomes in Britain over the past five years, though the Bank of England is expecting output per worker to pick up during 2014. John Philpott, director of the consultancy the Jobs Economist, said: ""We know UK labour productivity has been dire since the start of the recession. We now know our relative performance is even direr than first thought."" During the 1990s and 2000s, Britain closed the gap with the other G7 nations to less than 10%, but in the years since the 2007 financial crisis weak output and a smaller loss of jobs than in previous recessions has led to a marked worsening in Britain's productivity record. The ONS said the UK productivity deficit was most pronounced in comparison with the US, Germany and France, where the gap was now more than 30%. By contrast, British workers produced 11% more per hour than their Japanese counterparts and lagged behind those in Canada and Italy by five and 11 points respectively. Productivity tends to increase over time as new technology and better skills make economies more efficient. But the ONS said output per worker in 2012 was 3% lower than it had been five years earlier and 16% below the level that might have been expected, had its previous upward trend not been interrupted by the most severe slump of the postwar era. Moreover, even though the UK economy has recovered since 2012, there is no evidence to suggest that the productivity gap is likely to have narrowed, leaving the UK still staring up the international productivity league table. Philpott said that some of the productivity improvements during the pre-recession period may have been illusory because they were the result of an unsustainable boom. He added: ""The UK economy clearly needs, in particular, a strong resurgence of business investment in order to both start closing the productivity gap and to trigger a rise in real wages for people in work."" The Bank of England has cited improved productivity as a key factor in whether wage growth surpasses inflation in the second half of the year, which would ease the pressure on household budgets. Last week the Bank governor, Mark Carney, said: ""We are not complacent about this recovery at all. We are serene but not complacent. We need to see productivity come in to validate wage expectations."" Data published this week shows that wage growth rose from 0.9% to 1% in January, narrowing the gap with the CPI rate of inflation, which dipped from 2% to 1.9%. Some economists said the latest inflation figures indicated a downward trend in prices that could mean above-inflation wage growth for the first time since 2010. ""This should enable real earnings to rise,"" said Samuel Tombs of Capital . According to ONS figures published last month, living standards have suffered their most prolonged decline since 1964. Productivity was again cited as an important component of the consistent fall in real wages since 2010. ""It seems likely that a key driver is the response to the fall in productivity in 2008 and 2009, and its subsequent weakness,"" the ONS said. Describing a series of ""step-changes"" in annual real wage growth, the ONS pointed to average growth of 2.9% in the 1970s and 1980s, then growth of 1.5% in the 1990s, 1.2% in the 2000s, and then -2.2% since the beginning of this decade."
986	987	Britain's productivity: still a puzzle for policymakers and industry leaders 	"In a modern mill in a small industrial estate in the textile town of Bury, Lancashire, more than 100 whirring machines roll out 11m metres of high strength fabric every year. When parts of the plant were built in the mid-19th century there would have been 4,000 workers at its rows of looms – today, machines are still weaving, but the workforce is just over 100. The specialist cloth for Milliken European Airbag Products can be found in most big car brands, but as the plant's vice-president Graham Swann likes to say: ""Hopefully you will never see one of our products."" This factory is one of a few to have survived industrial decline in the region. It has become a model for high value manufacturing within its US parent company, the 150-year-old . Colleagues visit from Milliken's chemicals and textiles plants around the world to learn how this fabric maker has consistently beaten its productivity targets. Its rising efficiency will be a source of comfort for ministers and of envy to so many other firms in the UK struggling to increase their productivity. It has become an important question for economists and policymakers, as Britain struggles to keep up with competition from rapidly industrialising countries like China as well as high value manufacturing markets like the US. But the latest official UK data today is expected to show little improvement from the sluggishness of recent years. For Swann, a textile engineer with Milliken for 27 years, the downturn has been a driver of productivity growth, or what he calls ""doing more with less and more with what you have got"". ""The old school was if you reached a bottleneck you reached for new equipment and invested. Recent times have taught us that you need to look at your existing equipment,"" he says over the constant hum from the weave room behind him. The plant's productivity growth, which it measures in metres-per-man-hour and other ways, has ramped up over the last seven years under what Milliken calls a ""lean journey"", referring to a Japanese production philosophy that seeks to eliminate waste. That starts with the morning meeting – always standing, never sitting, and with a target time of 10 minutes. ""It usually lasts eight,"" says Swann. ""Meetings are a great way of wasting time if you are not careful."" Another Japanese concept, Kanban, is used to cut unnecessary stockpiling and tries to match inventories with demand. This goes for stationery in the office as well as supplies and production on the shop floor. ""If the customer stopped ordering today and we have material, we stop production,"" says Swann. But that does not mean downtime for employees; they simply report to their ""continuous improvement leader"" and get redeployed to other work. The plant has four of these, which in times past would have been known as shift leaders. Workers can come to them with ways to improve productivity. ""It could simply be someone feels they could work better on one side of a machine rather than the other,"" says Swann. Changes since 2007 have increased output by 12%, the equivalent of 10 weaving machines. Ministers know that raising productivity – what the UK can squeeze out of every hour worked and pound invested – is key to maintaining economic growth, now the low-hanging fruit of the early recovery is all but harvested. So far, the news has been disappointing. In 2012, productivity fell as the labour market grew faster than output. Last year, it was more stable as output recovered but was still weaker than policymakers had been expecting. On manufacturing productivity growth alone, the UK performs better than many other countries, but the sector is only a tenth of the economy. The fact manufacturing has achieved greater productivity growth than other sectors in the UK for decades adds more weight to chancellor George Osborne's call for a ""march of the makers"". For UK manufacturing, productivity growth was 2.3% per year between 1980 and 2009, when measured by ""total factor productivity"" – a broad measure of what goes into production, including investment such as research spending. That puts ahead of many other advanced economies. But taking in all sectors of the economy, the UK's growth rate was just 0.7% per year, according to the government's recent into the future of manufacturing. Professor Rajkumar Roy, head of Cranfield University's manufacturing and materials department, says true productivity is more than a simple question of output divided by input for one manufactured product in isolation. Investment in one particular new product can help other similar products. For example, ""in manufacturing, in a pure production environment, it is output over input. People understand that well. Outside that bare process you have to ask how projects have been affected by research and development and other factors,"" he says. Roy and his colleagues are working on a white paper on UK productivity to be published in May at the and asking for . The team are also analysing 25 years of press articles on productivity in the UK to pinpoint factors that account for dips in labour productivity. The work is not yet complete but already Roy has identified key culprits, including lack of skills. ""Lack of skilled people, training and education is an issue. There is a big difference in the number of graduates per capita between the US and UK,"" says Roy. He is not the only one grappling with Britain's so-called productivity puzzle. For the , getting a handle on is vital. In recent times, as output for companies has picked up, there has been a ""surprisingly"" large pick-up in employment, the Bank says. What it had actually expected to happen in response to rising demand was for workers to produce more per hour, as well as putting in longer hours – in other words, productivity would increase. Only later would companies really ramp up recruitment as demand continued to rise. Once companies are recruiting to meet demand, workers have more bargaining power on wages and that has knock-on effects for inflation, hence the Bank's keen interest. More importantly for pay, only with productivity growth can earnings keep growing. The lack of productivity growth in recent years has meant pay growth has stalled and wages have fallen in real terms. The Bank says it is unclear what has constrained productivity growth in recent years but that there are some reasons to be optimistic it will pick up. For example, as demand increases, some companies may be able to switch staff from winning business towards producing output. Better access to finance may also improve investment in automation, the Bank says. But, reassuringly for those working in manufacturing, experts say human contributions are just as important as machines and robots. For the Milliken factory, that means training workers to do more than one job. ""Machinery improvements improve the output. That has been going on for years. But what we try and do is get the best out of people,"" says Swann. Erik Bouts, who runs the European arm of the glass bottle makers Owens-Illinois, which has a UK plants in Essex and Clackmannanshire, echoes that. For him, productivity is ""producing more bottles with the same machine"". But that is just as much about the engineers running the machines as the machines themselves, he says. ""Glass is still a natural material. Every time you create a mix that is from sand or from recycled bottle and soda ash the result is a little different and that's why human talent, experience and skill is important to adjust the machines to get the quality we want."" The says that if companies work with employees to get them to ""work smarter and not harder"", productivity growth does not have mean increasingly bleak workplaces. But it does worry that for some companies the productivity push could mean exploiting workers and that a long hours culture – with unpaid overtime – makes a return for white collar workers in particular. ""We are in favour of high value added workplaces,"" says Paul Sellers, TUC policy officer. ""We want to see training, technology and better management rather than simply demanding fewer people do more work."" International comparisons suggest the UK has plenty of catching up to do on productivity. The gap between Britain and its rivals in developed countries is at its widest in 20 years, according to . The 2012 figures, published last month, put output per hour in the UK at 21 percentage points below the average for the other six members of the G7 – the US, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada. That is the widest gulf since 1992. UK productivity was 25 percentage points below the average for the rest of the G7 in 2012."
989	990	George Osborne warned Help to Buy scheme may inflate housing bubble 	"Three former chancellors have warned George Osborne that his Help to Buy scheme could inflate the housing bubble. , Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont urged him to rethink his flagship mortgage support scheme because of a ""raging housing boom"". Lord Lamont, who was Conservative chancellor of the exchequer under John Major, said Osborne was ""well aware of the potential problems"" with the Help to Buy programme. He told the Financial Times: ""My concern is that it will become harder for young people to buy a home."" He said: ""What will happen is that demand can be increased quickly, through measures like Help to Buy, but supply can only be increased slowly."" Lord Lawson, who served under Margaret Thatcher said that the government should end the scheme in London where house prices have rocketed. Elsewhere in the country, the maximum value of houses bought under Help to Buy should be halved to £300,000, he said. Labour's Alistair Darling also warned that the government was in danger of ""repeating the same mistakes"". He said: ""Unless supply can be increased substantially we will exacerbate that situation with schemes like Help to Buy."" The Treasury said: ""We're dealing with a very specific issue in addressing a market failure after the financial crisis, which has been about affordability and availability of mortgages."""
993	994	RBS put at 'competitive disadvantage' by bonus blocking plans 	"One of the City's biggest fund managers has warned that the government's decision to block Royal Bank of Scotland's bonus plans would put the bank at a competitive disadvantage. David Cumming, global head of equities at , said: ""It weakens its performance, reduces the value of the bank and consequently the amount of money taxpayers receive when the government eventually reduces their stake, ie it will hurt taxpayers."" The government has prevented RBS paying bankers bonuses up to double their salary, after Brussels capped payouts at 100% of salary unless shares give their approval for 200%. Cumming said on the BBC's Today Programme: ""It was politically expedient but it's going to damage the bank and damage the taxpayers, so we would not have been in support of that measure."" Even though the government said UK Financial Investments, which looks after the stakes in the bailed-out banks, would not back such a vote on higher bonus ratio, it is not blocking the bank from paying ""allowances"" to its top staff as another way round the bonus cap. Next year Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, will receive allowances worth £1m – the same size as his salary. Standard Life spoke out at Barclays annual meeting last week when it said had voted against the remuneration report but supported the plan to pay bonuses twice the size of salaries."
1009	1010	Liberal Democrats hold Treasury reins, claims Danny Alexander 	"The exert such strong influence in government that George Osborne has become a ""hostage"" of the party, the treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander has said. In an attempt to challenge assumptions that the Tories have been the dominant force in shaping the response to the downturn, Alexander said that the Lib Dems have ""captured"" the Treasury. Asked by Tom Bradby on ITV's The Agenda whether he is being held captive in the Treasury, Alexander said: ""No, no, the Treasury has been captured by the Liberal Democrats. That's why we're sorting out the British economy in the way we have. George Osborne's the hostage."" The remarks by Alexander set him at odds with Vince Cable, the Lib Dem business secretary, who accuses the Treasury of adopting an overly rigid approach to the deficit reduction plan. Cable says the coalition should have relaxed the rules on borrowing, particularly for councils, to increase house building. But Alexander makes clear that the deficit reduction plan has been correctly implemented. He said: ""The thing I'm proudest of, just speaking personally, is the difference we've made in turning the British economy around. I think we deserve just as much credit for that as the Tories do, and I'm going to go out and make that case a lot."" The Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary spoke out after Nick Clegg praised the way in which Labour appeared to be thinking about sharing power in a hung parliament as he said the Tories have become more ideological. The deputy prime minister's remarks to the BBC prompted speculation that Clegg would favour a Lib-Lab coalition in the event of a hung parliament. Alexander sought to make it clear the Lib Dems would adopt a policy of equal distance between the two major parties as they seek to act as a restraining influence on both. He said: ""We have a coalition with the Conservatives now. It's not based on love or marriage, it's based on the result of the election that was delivered by the British people last time. It's based on trying to sort out these huge economic problems that Labour have left us with. ""I think this coalition will run to the end, because every day that it runs the British economy gets stronger. I think that come the next election it will be down to the British people to decide what parliament they want to elect, who they want to give a majority to, or whether they think that having a majority Labour government or a majority Tory government is too much of a risk for this country and they want another coalition."" Alexander said that both of the larger parties were becoming more ideological. He said: ""One of the things that's interesting about coalition is that both the other two parties are becoming more ideological in a way. That Labour is becoming more, kind of, leftwing, the Tories are becoming more anti-European, hostile to people from overseas, in response to Ukip. And I think both of those things mean you can't have the Tories or Labour by themselves anymore."""
1013	1014	BP chief executive's pay triples in 2013 	"The pay of Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, tripled last year despite the legal threats still hanging over the company from . The oil boss received $8.7m (£5.2m) in salary, bonus and share awards last year, according to the company's annual report, compared with $2.6m in 2012. When contributions to his pension were included, Dudley, 58, got $13.2m for 2013 and has already accumulated a retirement package worth $2m a year. The American took over at BP towards the end of 2010 after , who led the group during the disastrous blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. has already paid out billions in compensation for the worst environmental accident in US history and could yet be found guilty of gross negligence by the US department of justice, which could bring penalties of up to $20bn. It has also failed in court to stop what it believes are ""absurd"" compensation payments to victims who do not need to prove financial loss from the spill. The share price has recovered from the immediate aftermath of spill but, at 486p, it is still far below the 650p it had reached just before the disaster in 2010. The company is also facing potential difficulties after taking a 20% stake in Russia's largely state-owned oil group, Rosneft last year, given the threat of sanctions against Moscow over the Crimea crisis. But the company said Dudley had taken steps to re-establish a good financial and safety record since he had been in charge. ""BP has made strong progress over the past three years under Bob Dudley's leadership – particularly in areas such as safety, operations and building for the future through reserve replacement – and his remuneration reflects this,"" said a BP spokesman. ""The great majority of his potential pay is directly dependent on BP's performance in areas essential both to the delivery of the company's strategy and to the long-term interests of its shareholders."" City analysts have praised Dudley in recent times for putting more emphasis on the interests of investors with a focus on dividends and share buybacks. ""Others tell this story but we suspect BP 'gets it' (the need to maximise returns for investors) more than most, given its travails in recent years,"" said Investec Securities in an equity note this week. But the oil and gas analyst Neil Morton retains a ""hold"" recommendation on the BP shares and a target price of 460p per share. Dudley has already disposed of around $40bn of assets and in October BP said that it expected to sell off a further $10bn of assets by the end of 2015, with the proceeds largely used to fund share buybacks. The new BP prides itself on being smaller and more streamlined with a decision earlier this week to hive off its onshore oil and gas assets in the US into a separate business to be run autonomously. Dudley has not ruled out a separate stock listing for this operation at some point. The increase in Dudley's pay during 2013 was accentuated by a relatively lower level for him during 2012 when the company's difficulties were deemed that much more profound. The £5.2m figure compares with his head of downstream operations, Iain Conn who received £3.4m, up from £1.8m in 2012, while finance director Brian Gilvery received £2.1m last year compared to £1.4m in 2012."
1023	1024	Is it time to rethink Britain's green belt? 	n January 1914, Aston Webb, architect of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the facade of Buckingham Palace and parts of Birmingham University, had a dream. He told the London Society, a group of architects and others concerned with the improvement of the capital, how he was transported a century forward to the year 2014, where he saw “a beautiful sylvan line practically all around London”, with “a certain amount of open spaces, pleasure grounds” set aside by “town planning schemes”. He called it a “green belt”. As futuristic fantasies go, it was prescient. London is indeed surrounded by a green belt, as are 13 other urban areas in England and 10 in Scotland, zones that forbid new development, except, as the policy wording has it, in “very special circumstances”. They occupy 13% the total land area of England, compared with the 10% that is urbanised. Almost anyone you talk to on the subject agrees that the green belt is one of the great successes of planning, anywhere in the world. It has prevented the interminable exurbia, the light smearing of development over landscape that you get in the United States and many other countries. But it also has costs. It stops cities expanding, which had previously done so for centuries. It contributes to the scarcity and cost of decent homes in large parts of the country. It encourages bizarre and wasteful patterns of commuting. It often fails in its original aim of providing accessible recreational space for city dwellers. It is enforced with a rigidity that makes little sense, except as a sign of mistrust. It would be naive to think that the country’s housing problems would solved just by handing tracts of the green belt to developers. Something more is required, which is the ability to plan positively, to create new places as well as protect old ones, a skill this country had until relatively recently. It is not a small thing to rediscover this art, but then neither is the green belt, nor the current issues of housing. The green belt arouses strong passions, but the debates around it are about something still larger, which is the ability of a country to act together in a shared endeavour, or to subdivide into competing interests. The fact that it is named in the singular, although there are many green belts, indicates its status as an idea, even an ideal, as well as a place. It is part of English, if not British, national identity, protected by the shade of William Blake. It is brandished at party conferences and makes tabloid headlines, with frequent references to the “concreting over” of a green and pleasant land. It is used to justify many things; when, for example, towers are approved along the banks of the Thames, it is partly on the (specious) grounds that doing so protects the green belt. It has the power to strangle the careers of conservative politicians who question it. As one campaigner tells me: “It is the only universally popular part of the planning system.” Yet it is being questioned. The libertarian thinktank the Adam Smith Institute has argued that, . Defenders of the green belts, such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), are accused of ignoring “those who are marginalised and condemned to poor housing”. , the group to which Aston Webb told his dream and which was instrumental in creating the green belt, has commissioned research from the commercial real estate company Colliers International, which says that we “need to move away from the idea that the countryside is a sacrosanct patchwork of medieval hedgerows” and towards the recognition of “housing as a need to be met in locations with appropriate environmental capacity”. A particularly vocal critic, Professor Paul Cheshire of the London School of Economics, has written that “ ”. He argues that new houses in Britain are 40% more expensive than the Netherlands, which is more densely populated, and that the green belt is at least partly to blame. Business secretary Vince Cable recently tossed away the nation’s golfing vote by calling for homes to be built on golf courses, apparently inspired by the recent discovery that Surrey, the most green belty of counties, has more space dedicated to hitting small white balls with sticks than it has for homes. Cable’s was a bold statement, reminiscent of . He also argued that most people would rather have greenery “outside their own house than sitting 20 miles away where they have no access to it”. It is said that green belts are not fulfilling their original aims of providing recreation for city dwellers. Dwellers of Toxteth or Hackney are not especially likely to make the journey to their nearest green belts, rather than Sefton or Victoria Park, or to countryside further afield. Rather, says Cheshire, the idea has been “used as a form of exclusionary zoning by the more affluent residents who had got there already”. It is a device, in this view, for rich dwellers of green belts, who enjoy proximity to both cities and countryside, to stop anyone else sharing their idyll. He argues that green belts force commuters to live outside them, and jump over them daily, some travelling from as far away as Norwich to work in London. It is also claimed that much of the green belt is not all that green, but includes such things as scrap yards and gravel pits. Cheshire questions the environmental quality of the intensive agriculture that is the largest single use of green belt land, and cites the National Ecosystem Assessment of 2011 as saying that such land “has no environmental benefits at all”. Suburban gardens contribute much more biodiversity. It is argued, finally, that other designations, such as areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks and sites of special scientific interest do some of the job of protecting what is really important about the countryside, which makes green belts less vital. We can only guess how different the debate would be if the green belt were still known by its original name, the green girdle. It was coined in relation to London by Conservative members of the London county council, Lord Meath and William Bull, in 1901, and was proposed in various versions by several others in coming years and decades. A key supporter was Patrick, later Lord, Abercrombie, one of the founders of the CPRE and creator of the Abercrombie plan, which would guide the development of London and its surroundings after the second world war. From the late 1930s to the 1950s, legislation and policy gave local authorities progressively more power to declare what were by then called green belts, first around London and then in the rest of the country. A consistent theme was that a green belt should be “a healthful zone of pleasure, civic interest and enlightenment”, or “a great communal estate – secure for all time to the use and enjoyment of the people of London”, or should “protect its inhabitants from disease, by providing fresh air, fresh fruit and vegetables, space for recreation and contact with and knowledge of nature”. After the Great War, proponents cited an occasion when 540 out of 1,000 potential army recruits were found to be too unhealthy to serve: the recreational opportunities of a green belt would make the urban worker more fit to fight. After the last war, with its demand to dig for victory, the agricultural importance of the green belt was stressed. Jonathan Manns, of Colliers International, also describes how in changing from girdle to belt it increased in size. Its earliest advocates were thinking of a strip a quarter of a mile wide, which it was later suggested might thicken in places to a mile or two. Duncan Sandys, the Conservative minister who promoted green belts in the 1950s, envisaged a width of seven to 10 miles. In the event, local authorities liked the idea so much that it can reach 35 miles. Manns argues that nimbyism was a powerful motivation from early on: in 1960, it was observed that most of Surrey was being designated as green belt “with the object of ensuring that if London’s population overleaps the green belt, as it’s clearly doing, the emigrants shall alight, say, in Hampshire or Sussex, rather than in Surrey”. According to these narratives, in short, a place conceived for the benefit of environmentally deprived city dwellers has been appropriated by the well-off property owners who live within it, who want everyone else, as a on the subject almost puts it, to “get off our land”. It is also questioned whether a part-haphazard construct should be sacrosanct, as if it were a Magna Carta in geographical form. In all this debate, and despite its celebrity, the exact nature of the green belt – or belts – is elusive. If you live in or near one, you probably know well that you do; if you don’t, you might be vague as to where they are. The inner boundaries of green belts are often clear – knife-sharp boundaries where buildings simply stop – but the outer edges can be invisible. From one field to another, the designation ends. As might be expected of something so large and widely distributed, it is many things. It includes places of great beauty such as Box Hill in Surrey, and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire, but also straggly farms near Heathrow and various industrial uses. Students at the Royal College of Art, led by the architects Charles Holland, David Knight and Finn Williams, have produced an impressive series of maps of the metropolitan green belt around London that show such things as the distribution of landfill sites, Travellers’ sites, branches of Waitrose, crime (mostly low), income (mostly high) and political allegiance (quite conservative). “One of the main characteristics of the green belt,” says Holland, “is that it has no main characteristics.” Its nature is sufficiently vague as to serve whatever political rhetoric is projected on to it. Take Amersham, Bucks, a hybrid of idyll and unease. It is an historic settlement miraculously accessible, as the green belt’s early proponents might have hoped, from the London underground, from where you can easily walk through its not-sprawling periphery into fields and woods and an 18th-century park landscaped by Humphry Repton. Some of this countryside is delightful; some of it so highly processed that it is like walking through the sliced bread shelves at Tesco, which is what presumably it will soon become. A ceaseless thrum of bypass traffic pervades and the threat hovers of the rail line, which is due to charge through the area, it being a paradox of green belt policy that it is easier to build major infrastructure in it than houses. Or go to Knutsford, outside Manchester, Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford, now in the constituency of George Osborne, where the green belt has largely done its job of keeping the shape of a fine old town. One walk out of it takes you through postwar housing that seems to have been permitted before the green belt was decided, past uses important to the town such as sports clubs and allotments, towards dullish fields along a road hostile to pedestrians. A more rewarding route is into Tatton Park, a magnificent landscape attached to a stately home, which is preserved by the National Trust more than by green belt laws. Then there is Grenoble Road, Oxford, currently a front line in struggles over the green belt, as Oxford city council and Magdalen College want to build on some fields they own, in the face of fierce opposition from the area’s CPRE and other local groups. The road is wide and fast, with aggressive traffic. On one side is the stadium of Oxford United, its car parks and leisure complex, plus, behind high hedges, the two-storey houses of the Blackbird Leys estate, which from time to time attracts the attention of the national press for its joyriding, keying of cars and other crimes. On the other side are fields, hedges, clumps of trees as in a landscape painting, but also electricity pylons, with a sewage station and an electrical substation nearby. Thanks to the road, access from homes is not pleasant. This is the sort of niceish-but-not-wonderful landscape that leads many to ask what harm could come from nibbling off a bit of it for housing. It is not, however, the territory of Jag-driving nimbies of legend, anxious to preserve their property values and exclude people different from themselves. Nor does this description fit the representatives of the CPRE I meet here and in other locations in the Oxford green belt – Kidlington, a charming old village extended at one end by less charming postwar estates, where there is talk of further expansion, and Cumnor, where a plan for 200 homes on what looks like a particularly inappropriate site has been, for now, beaten back. They include the former headmaster of a secondary school, a retired civil servant and a retired business startup adviser. One of them, Alan Lodwick, says he feels “ disenfranchised and disempowered” in the face of the real money, “the barristers, property developers, planning and property consultants and the landowners they represent, who can throw vast resources into making sure they make even more money out of the [green belt] land that they own.” Another, Michael Tyce, says that the fields off Grenoble Road “are doing exactly what the green belt is supposed to do – it is serving its purpose as a green lung”. City-dwellers do use it for recreation, he says, and, indeed, some walk by as he speaks. Tyce and his colleagues contest the figures of the strategic housing market assessment, or SHMA, the device by which local authorities try to determine the number of new homes they need. They say that the case for development around Oxford is based on a false premise, which is that it is an area for growth of jobs and business as well as homes. There is virtually full employment in Oxford, so why not attract work to places in the north that need it, which, says Tyce, used to be government policy? “Now the policy seems to be to bring people to the south, but it has never been put to the test. There has been no consultation.” Together with Helen Marshall, director of Oxfordshire CPRE, he argues that the green belt is “actual countryside that is well-loved and well-used by local people”, and that the danger is of making the county “into one big sprawl”. “I don’t think you’ll find anyone who wants that. I think most people would rather it continue as a rural county, rather than become Wolverhampton.” Alan Lodwick, in Kidlington, makes a further point, which is that the green belt exists also to protect the character of towns and cities and that the character of Oxford, with its compact medieval centre, is based on its being the size it is now. A recurring theme of conversation is the congestion now in and around Oxford – waits of over an hour on rush-hour roads, a bus system with nowhere to expand. More homes, they say, will only make it worse. I stand in another ho-hum field outside Kidlington, the premises of a molecular genetic company off to one side, and ask again the question that keeps coming up in this debate – would it be so terrible to build on it? Lodwick explains that the issue is not just about this field, but the cumulative effect of many fields being developed, such that Oxford and its surroundings become completely different places. Oxford has particular significance in the arguments about green belt. Danny Dorling, professor of geography at Oxford University, has said that the scarcity and cost of housing could easily cause the university “to lose its top position… the growth of knowledge-based industries would also suffer if the area is unable to provide junior staff with homes they can afford, and services such as education for their children. The area could ossify and end up like Santa Barbara, a place where only the rich can live.” Like the losing cox in a boat race, Oxford looks nervously at Cambridge, which is finding it easier to expand and to provide homes for university staff and sites for technology companies attracted by the university. Oxford also features in the study that recently won the £250,000 , which asked: “How would you deliver a new garden city which is visionary, economically viable and popular?” The winning entry, by the planning and urban design practice Urbed, argued that the best way to create successful new communities was to graft them on to the “rootstock” of existing cities, to take advantage of their infrastructure and establishe a sense of place. This would require taking “confident bites” out of the green belt. Most of Urbed’s essay concerned an imaginary town called Uxcester – a modified version of York – but it chose Oxford as real-life test case. David Rudlin, of Urbed, endorses the importance of green belts, but says that in this city “it has become a tourniquet”. Urbed propose a “snowflake” plan, with new sub-centres radiating from the old centre, leaving green spaces between them. The new neighbourhoods would have exemplary tram systems, would be designed to encourage walking, and for every acre given to development, another would be given to publicly accessible open space – Tatton Parks, if one were to be really optimistic, rather than those dull fields outside Knutsford. Urbed’s inspirations are both English garden cities of the early 20th century and much admired recent housing . Essential to their idea is the huge difference in value between agricultural land and land with permission to build. At present, the difference turns into a lottery-sized jackpot for landowners, once they get permission, and profit for builders, who then have a strong motivation to build as cheaply as possible. Urbed wants some of this differential to pay for higher quality homes, infrastructure and open spaces. The idea of garden cities, or new towns, has always been closely linked to that of the green belt, with both sharing the belief that it is good for people to live near nature. The first campaigners for a green girdle, or belt, were inspired by Ebenezer Howard, who in 1898 first proposed the idea of garden cities. The same Lord Abercrombie who helped found the CPRE, and successfully advocated the green belt, was also behind the new towns planned in Britain following the second world war. Although often sneered at, they successfully fulfilled their social aims while also achieving a financial surplus. In Abercrombie’s world, constriction went with creation and prevention with provision. Building was stopped in some places so that it could be done well in others. Since Margaret Thatcher’s government the positive half of this formula been abandoned, leaving only the power to negate: she wound down the new towns’ development corporations and took their proceeds. She also set the scene for a battle between halves of conservatism that is still raging, between free marketeers and those who think their party is about conserving something, between the Adam Smith Institute, which sees green-belt policy as a restriction to be challenged like any other, and the , which wants builders’ Hands Off Our Land. The people who lose out in this row are citizens who want a decent home. In Thatchers’s time, her environment secretary, Nicholas Ridley, proposed relaxing the green belt, but was shut up. More recently, the planning minister, Nick Boles, didn’t seem quite sound on the subject, which may be why he is now the ex-planning minister. His successor, Brandon Lewis, was so quick to slap down Urbed’s proposals that he can barely have had enough time to read them. The government didn’t want urban sprawl, he said, and anyway was supporting a planned garden city of “up to” 15,000 homes in Ebbsfleet, Kent. Which is depressing. Urbed’s work is a serious attempt to address an ever-growing and scandalous problem, which is the low quantity and abysmal quality of new homes, to which Ebbsfleet alone will make a minuscule difference. Nor is Urbed proposing “sprawl”. It deserves a fair hearing from a government that cannot offer anything more than a slow seepage of overpriced developers’ housing. Urbed’s snowflakes cannot address the nation’s housing issues by themselves – such things as the urban developments championed by Richard Rogers are also important – but the scale of the problem is such that every good tool available must be considered. Until abolished by the current government, there was a laudable target of building 60% of new housing on “brownfield sites” in cities. This, of course, left the not-small proportion of 40% to be built in the countryside. There is a large chunk of countryside not designated as green belt, which would, if plans such as Urbed’s are to be ignored, take the brunt of the 40%. Which makes little sense, as much of this countryside has a greater environmental value than green belt land. Development there, being further from cities, encourages longer journeys by car. Standing in Grenoble Road, it’s possible to see how Urbed’s thinking could help a place like this. In every respect except the preservation of green space this spot is a planning disaster – the dominating road, the cut-off housing estate, the shoddy buildings around the stadium. If, at the cost of losing some of the nearby fields, these problems could be addressed, while also allowing more people to live close to nature, might that not be a good thing? “Rubbish,” says Michael Tyce of the CPRE. Why? Because “Urbed’s scheme relies on destroying existing protections”, which would set a precedent. There would be no stopping further encroachment and the gaps between the dendrites of the snowflake would be filled. “Even though it’s not what Urbed wants, that’s what will happen.” In other words, the boundaries of the green belt, set partly arbitrarily 50 or 60 years ago, can never be altered, ever, no matter how the world changes, because we can’t trust politicians and developers not to rush into any breach in the rules. The trouble is, on the question of trust, Tyce is right. There is pitifully little evidence, on recent form, that new development will be anything like the well-considered settlements Urbed proposes. When the property consultancy Colliers International seem to disparage medieval hedgerows, they don’t inspire great confidence in whatever alternative they might propose – nor do they make convincing Jacobins, or champions of the common man. There need to be more examples of what could be, which will require a greater mind than Brandon Lewis’s to make it happen. Yet this gap in trust has to be bridged. The costs of not doing so include housing that is more scarce and expensive than it need be, of worse quality, and more badly located, such that people have to make long commutes across green belts to their nearest cities. The current reality, as Urbed’s Rudlin puts it, “is that development is dribbling out in all the wrong places”. Meanwhile, pressure on cities that try to grow within existing boundaries will eventually become intolerable. Consider, for example, that London used to be admired as a city of houses and gardens, yet in new developments gardens have almost disappeared, which is directly attributable to the city’s green belt. Other popular cities will face the same problem. For all these reasons, it is no longer good enough to insist that green belts must, at all costs, never change.
1025	1026	Surge in British companies' marketing spend points to economic recovery 	"British businesses are on a marketing blitz, with an influential industry report revealing the biggest surge in spending since records began 14 years ago. In a sign that confidence about the economic recovery is taking hold, marketers increased their advertising, sponsorship, public relations and other promotional budgets for the sixth quarter in a row, according to the Bellwether report. The first three months of the year showed the sharpest upturn since the Institute of Practitioners in (IPA) began collecting Bellwether data, with a net balance of 20% of companies registering an increase, up sharply from the final quarter of 2013, when the increase was 11%. The survey measures the strength of the media market by subtracting the percentage of marketers reporting a decrease from those reporting an increase. During the full financial year to April, a net 17% of marketing executives reported an increase, marking the first net positive year since 2006-07. ""This is a very good place to be,"" said the IPA's director general, Paul Bainsfair. ""All very good news for the government in the run-up to an election year."" Optimism looks likely to grow this financial year, with data suggesting that 26% of companies expect to see growth, the best recorded for seven years. Traditional media such as television, newspapers and magazines have benefited most, reversing recent trends by performing better than internet advertising in the first three months of the year, indicating a growing willingness among marketers to commit to high-profile campaigns. Google, whose business model has wreaked havoc in the media industry, has emerged as one of the UK's biggest advertisers, raising its spending by 50% last year to £45m, ahead of Mars and telecoms firm O2. In the Bellwether report estimates for advertising on TV, newspapers and magazines were revised upwards by 12% of companies, internet by 8.5%, and spending on events by 6% of companies. ""The spring Bellwether report reveals the most upbeat assessment of business and marketing spend we have seen since starting the survey in 2000,"" said an economist and Bellwether author, Chris Williamson. ""Last year saw the biggest rise in marketing spend since 2006, and 2014 looks set to be even better. ""Companies are ramping up their markets and advertising expenditure in the face of growing optimism about the economic outlook. As higher marketing spend is also usually accompanied by rising business investment and job creation, this augurs well for economic growth to top 3% this year."""
1031	1032	New car sales top 2m for 2013 	"New car sales are continuing to race ahead, with registrations already outstripping those of 2012 with one month of the year still to go. A total of 159,581 new cars were registered in November – a 7% rise on the figure for November 2012, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. Last month's figures took the total in the year so to 2,111,819 – a 9.9% rise on the January-November 2012 total and already in excess of the year-end 2012 figure of 2.04m. Sales for this year are on course to total around 2.25m, which would make this the best year for new registrations since the pre-recession year of 2007, when sales reached 2.4m. The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: ""Motorists have bought more than 2m cars so far in 2013 – a tremendous success for the industry on the back of buoyant consumer confidence and innovative new products. ""With the UK economy looking increasingly positive, we can expect strong underlying demand for new cars to continue into 2014, with volumes set to match or surpass those seen this year."" Alternatively fuelled vehicle sales have risen 16.4% so far this year but account for as little as 1.4% of the new-car market. Meanwhile, (JLR) is to become the first UK car-maker to open a manufacturing facility in Brazil. JLR is investing £240m in the project, with the development of a plant that will ­produce up to 24,000 vehicles a year. The factory, based in the city of Itatiaia, Rio de Janeiro, will initially employ 400 people, with the first vehicles due to come off the assembly line in 2016. The company produces SUVs such as the Freelander, but refused to say what models would be made in . Its chief executive, Ralf Speth, said: ""Customers there have an increasing appetite for highly capable premium products.

1046	1047	George Osborne hails reforms as key to economic recovery 	" will claim on Monday that the changes to the UK's taxes and welfare system are the most significant for two decades and will drive the UK's economic recovery by encouraging jobs growth. But as the chancellor highlights fresh measures to tighten access to welfare, the Department for Work and Pensions is studying a government-commissioned report highlighting inadequate procedures, resulting in a lack of communication particularly for the vulnerable. The report, not yet published, was commissioned by ministers last year and was due to be handed to ministers last week. Labour has also produced figures showing the government has achieved just 0.3% (3,780) of their target of getting 1 million people on universal credit by April 2014. In a major speech attempting to drill home the coalition's polling advantage on the economy, Osborne will hail the Conservative plan as ""the only plan in town"". He will say the government has already created more than 1.3m jobs and that its reforms are set to lead to 3m new jobs in the private sector from 2011 to 2018. For the first time in 35 years, a greater proportion of people in Britain are in work than in the US. He will also point to the national implementation of the claimant commitment and the start of the ""Help to Work"" scheme aimed at 200,000 or so over-24-year-olds who have been unemployed for a year and then on the Work Programme for more than two years but still not found a job. From next Monday, anyone in this category still claiming jobseeker's allowance will have to accept a community work placement, such as making meals for the elderly; visit a jobcentre every day; or take part in further training. The claimant commitment, already introduced in hundreds of jobcentres, tightens the requirements placed on the unemployed before they can receive benefit. Osborne will also highlight tax changes being introduced this month including a corporation tax cut and business rates cut due to come in on Tuesday and the increase in personal allowance from Sunday. He will claim: ""These are the biggest cuts to personal and business taxes for two decades, and we're making our benefit system more affordable and fairer, too."" Arguing ""Britain is starting to walk tall in the world again"", he will say ""this week represents a big moment in the country's tax system. ""This week you will keep more of the money you earn. This week your business can keep more of the money it makes, so you can invest, expand and create new jobs."" Osborne's reference to the increase in the personal allowance to £10,000 for 34 million taxpayers is bound to be raised by the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg at his weekly press conference where he will point out that the tax allowance reforms are a Lib Dem idea initially resisted by the Tories. Osborne will claim: ""We inherited a welfare system that didn't work. There was not enough help for those looking for a job – people were just parked on benefits. Frankly, there was not enough pressure to get a job – some people could just sign on and get almost as much money staying at home as going out to work."" But a government-commissioned review into the way in which benefit sanctions are administered by the DWP has found communication failures and unnecessary bureaucratic complexities. The review does not suggest the principle of benefit sanctions is wrong, or that the level of sanctions is unduly punitive. The work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, commissioned the review in November from Matthew Oakley, a former Treasury civil servant, then analyst at centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange and now working at consumer body Which?. In preparing it, Oakley has spoken to the DWP, claimants and welfare advisers in charities. The review was in part prompted by court rulings that the government was wrong to sanction some people for failing to participate on government work experience schemes because the DWP failed to communicate clearly, or in sufficient detail, what would be required from them, or the consequences of failing to co-operate in terms of lost benefits. Labour agreed to let new laws pass through parliament in response to the court rulings but only on the condition that the government set up an independent review into the wider issue of communication. There have been widespread claims that centrally driven targets are responsible for benefit sanctions imposed on jobseekers, and that jobcentre staff are under pressure to increase sanctions due to a more punitive regime introduced by Duncan Smith to push down the claimant count. The review has not looked as closely at these issues. Oakley's report – already handed to the DWP – will find that there is evidence of a systematic failure of communications of the requirements being made of claimants both by the jobcentre and by work programme providers. It will find as a result some people are having benefits withdrawn because they failed to understand what they were required to do. This is partly due to the DWP's need to put leaflets and letters in a legal language that some claimants find hard to understand. It will also suggest that the obstacles to communication of sanctions are especially severe on the work programme since its sub-contractors do not have powers to propose sanctions."
1049	1050	George Osborne denies panicking over economy after IMF criticism 	"The chancellor, George Osborne, has laughed off suggestions he is in a state of panic about the slow rate of Britain's economic recovery, denying that the has rejected his austerity policies. He said the full verdict of the IMF would come in May, when it visits the UK to make a complete assessment, adding that the represented the views of only one man. Last week, Blanchard said very weak private demand in Britain showed it might be time for policymakers to consider an adjustment to their fiscal plans. He also warned that Osborne may be playing with fire by continuing with his current deficit-reduction plan. The managing director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, has been more guarded in her criticisms. Osborne said of Blanchard: ""He is one voice. He has a well-known set of views on this that he has expressed over several years. The IMF will do its analysis of the British economy as it does of all economies when it comes to Britain in May."" He conceded that the UK economy faced serious challenges, but pointed to the fact that the UK's neighbours were having ""an even tougher time"". ""What the IMF has said, actually, is that the United Kingdom is forecast to grow more than Germany, than France, than the rest of the eurozone,"" he said. ""The British economy of course faces very serious economic challenges. The fact that the rest of our neighbours are having an even tougher economic time does not help because a lot of our exports do go there. ""We have a slow and difficult recovery because of the problems of the banking system, and those are the problems that need addressing, which is why we have things like the Funding for Lending scheme to businesses to grow and homeowners to borrow."" Osborne said he agreed with . He pointed out that he had put the archbishop, Justin Welby, on his parliamentary banking commission. He also insisted that he had cut borrowing by a third, pointing out that debt as a percentage of GDP had fallen from 11.5% and was forecast to be just under 8%. Osborne said he came to government at a time when the administration was borrowing £159bn a year but it was now forecast in the budget to be borrowing £120bn."
1058	1059	Relief for Osborne as UK budget deficit narrows 	"Chancellor George Osborne was ""spared blushes"" thanks to a slightly better-than-expected outturn for last year's public finances, economists said, after official data showed the deficit edged lower. In a week that will reveal if the UK has slipped into an , there was some relief for the Treasury from news the budget gap just beat market expectations. The deficit for the financial year 2012-13 also met predictions by the government's independent forecaster, the (OBR), saving the government further embarrassment after a series of attacks on its austerity drive in recent days. Still, economists said the gap in the public finances was way above levels envisaged when the austerity drive was launched. Echoing criticism from the International Monetary Fund, they also warned it was unlikely to improve much over this year. ""The UK public finances data spares the chancellor's blushes,"" said Martin Beck at Capital . ""But the fact that borrowing has come in a tiny bit under the OBR's forecast – which, of course, was heavily revised up during the course of the last fiscal year – is neither here nor there. The big picture is that the government still ran an underlying deficit of almost 8% of GDP. And note that in the first forecast produced by the OBR for the present government back in June 2010, borrowing in 2012/13 was expected to be only £89bn."" The said public sector borrowing came in at £120.6bn in 2012-13, £300m lower than in 2011-12, once special factors such as the transfer of the Royal Mail pension fund and profits from quantitative easing were excluded. The full-year figures were published with data showing a better-than-expected outturn for March. The OBR, the Treasury's independent forecaster, said at the time of the that it expected an unchanged annual deficit of £120.9bn, on that measure. The figures on Tuesday mean Osborne has, by a whisker, achieved his promise that his austerity measures would bring year-on-year cuts in the UK's annual deficit. They also showed government spending rose at a slightly slower pace than the OBR had forecast. The official data come just days after Fitch Ratings became the second major international agency to strip the UK of its top-notch credit rating. In a blow to the government, to AA+ from AAA, citing a weaker economic and fiscal outlook. The government also last week, which urged Osborne to rethink his austerity strategy in the wake of weak economic figures. Critics of the government's austerity drive say it risks being self-defeating by knocking growth so much that income from various taxes will fall while spending on benefits will have to rise. Economists noted the latest public finance data showed taxes on income and wealth fell last year while income from North Sea oil production was weak. ""The big picture is that fiscal consolidation has got stuck in the mud of near-zero GDP growth,"" said David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas. ""The fiscal consolidation effort has blown well off course over the last few years. Largely those winds have been coming from Europe, but at least some – the failure to sort the banking system out for example – are home grown."" The Treasury sought to highlight the improvement in the deficit on a year earlier. ""Though it is taking time, the government is fixing this country's economic problems. The deficit is down by a third, a million and a quarter new private sector jobs have been created and interest rates are at near-record lows,"" said a spokesperson. But the opposition Labour party seized on the ""essentially"" unchanged picture for the public finances. ""These figures show that the government's failed economic policies have been totally self-defeating as a flat-lining economy has seen deficit reduction grind to a halt,"" said Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow financial secretary to the Treasury. Official data for first quarter GDP are due on Thursday and economists on the whole believe the UK will have eked out some growth, thereby narrowly avoiding a triple-dip recession."
1060	1061	UK inflation rate increases to 1.8% 	"The UK rate of inflation rose for the first time in almost a year in April after consumers paid more to travel over the popular Easter period. Annual inflation measured by the consumer prices index rose to 1.8% from 1.6% in March, also pushed higher by petrol prices. It was the first rise in inflation in 10 months, and economists had forecast a smaller increase to 1.7%. The figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that inflation is once again outpacing wage growth, with the in the three months to March. The month-on-month figure between February and March showed an increase in earnings of just 1%. had finally caught up with inflation in recent months, following a prolonged period of real wage falls since 2008. The April inflation figure threatens to reignite fears that a cost-of-living crisis is not yet over. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""Last month we were told the living standards crisis was over. Yet one month later real wages are falling again. Even on a measure that excludes the cost of housing, prices are rising faster than wage packets. ""It will be years before workers even recover the earnings they have lost since 2008, let alone start to feel any better off."" However, Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital described April's rise in inflation as a ""blip"". He said: ""The rise in UK consumer price inflation in April should not be seen as a sign that the economic recovery is causing underlying price pressures to build. ""Instead, the increase in CPI inflation from 1.6% to 1.8% in April almost entirely reflects the impact of the later timing of Easter, which fell in April this year but in March last year."" The biggest driver of the rise in inflation was higher transport costs as air fares and sea fares increased as people travelled over Easter. Air fares jumped 18% while sea travel costs increased by 22%. Petrol prices also contributed to the higher inflation rate, as unchanged prices in April compared with a fall in the same month last year. The rises were enough to offset a 0.5% fall in food prices. Despite the increase in inflation in April it was the fourth month that the annual rate was below the Bank of England's 2% target. The last period of below target inflation was more than four years ago. ""The outlook for inflation over the coming months is benign, with CPI set to stay below the 2% target over the next year,"" said Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets. suggested inflation will remain close to the 2% target over the next few years. With a lack of inflationary pressure, the bank's governor, Mark Carney, reiterated that the bank would be in no rush to raise interest rates – on hold at 0.5% since March 2009 – with the first rise most likely around the time of the general election in the second quarter of 2015. The Treasury said: ""The latest figures show that inflation remains below the target rate and well below half of the peak in September 2011. Lower inflation and rising job numbers show that the government's long-term plan is working and Britain is coming back. The biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is creating a brighter economic future."""
1061	1062	Credit firms warned over adverts 	"Companies that offer consumer credit such as payday lenders, debt management firms and brokers must do more to make sure their advertising does not mislead customers, the City regulator said. The (FCA) said that since April, when it took over supervision of the consumer credit market, it has reviewed over 1,500 financial promotions for consumer credit products and it has opened 227 cases into promotions that were ""non-compliant"". A quarter of cases opened related to advertisements for high-cost short-term credit, with many not prominently displaying a risk warning or representative APR (annual percentage rate), the FCA said. Some 80% of consumer credit cases to date related to digital media such as websites, emails and texts. Rules state that all promotions must be clear, fair and not misleading for consumers. Examples of financial promotions which did not meet the regulations included internet search terms that took consumers to unrelated sponsored links. For example, a search for ""government debt help"" returned a sponsored link for a loan, potentially misleading people to believe the firm was offering government assistance. The FCA has also uncovered advertisements for fee-paying debt management firms that did not make it clear that services are not free of charge and promotions that guaranteed firms would provide credit regardless of customers' circumstances. Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA, said: ""It is important that all firms ensure financial promotions are fair, clear and not misleading so that customers are able to make informed decisions. ""We are disappointed to see standards fall short of what we expect, particularly in the consumer credit space, four months from when we took over regulation. ""We believe that firms in this sector can do more to ensure financial promotions meet the standards we would expect and will continue to monitor performance in this area."" The regulator said firms have responded positively when it has contacted them and have been quick to make changes to promotions that do not meet standards. It said it will continue to monitor financial promotions and take action to drive up standards."
1068	1069	Labour threatens to block AstraZeneca takeover bid if it wins 2015 election 	"Labour's shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, has threatened to block the proposed £63bn takeover of by its US rival Pfizer if the party wins the general election. Umunna said that if came to power in May 2015 he would subject a deal to a public interest test and block the transaction if the result was negative. Analysts and lawyers said the timeframe of a takeover supported Labour's threat, as a deal could take more than a year to clear regulatory hurdles in Europe, the US and China, where is the largest drugmaker and AstraZeneca the second-largest. Umunna said Labour would amend the criteria for a public interest test on sensitive takeovers to include the impact on Britain's science and research and development base. The deal would be blocked if a panel composed of scientists and business people warned that it would have an adverse effect, said Umunna. ""If they advise that it could be adverse then I as secretary of state, if I was in a position to do so, and the legal advice of the department is such that we could do so, and the transaction had not taken place, I would intervene to block it on those grounds."" Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Umunna said he was not against foreign takeovers. ""We are very much open for business but we could be open without saying yes to every single merger regardless of the impact on the economy."" Umunna added, however, that the UK had one of the most permissive takeover regimes in the western world. AstraZeneca has refused to negotiate with Pfizer, which made a £63bn approach two weeks ago and is preparing to come back with a higher offer that could value the Anglo-Swedish firm at up to £67bn. John Milligan, a competition partner at Clyde & Co, said delays could mean a deal would not be closed before the election in May next year. ""If the European commission had serious concerns as to the deal's compatibility with the common market – which it may well do given its size – it could take a minimum of six months and more likely quite a bit longer, potentially 12 months or more, if commitments were required to secure clearance."" He added: ""China and US would similarly take many months. One would expect the EU, US and Chinese authorities to consult with one another on their merger respective investigations."" Labour would have to legislate to expand the public interest test's categories to include research, but Milligan said this would take no more than two months. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca's top scientist, Menelas Pangalos, warned that the takeover would jeopardise important relationships with UK universities and research organisations. As AstraZeneca took members of the British media on a tour of the site of its future campus in Cambridge, where it plans to move by 2016, Pangalos, who heads the company's innovative medicines unit and used to work at Pfizer, said AstraZeneca was an ""integral part of the UK academic community"" through research collaborations and funding of postdoctorates, student sponsorships and internships. ""You can't just build that overnight. This takes years of building … it's also quite fragile, and it's all down to people. If you turn that on its head it will have a huge detrimental impact on science in the UK."" AstraZeneca has just launched a joint research fund worth £9m with the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), adjacent to AstraZeneca's planned £330m campus in Cambridge, which is still a grassy field at this stage. Sir Hugh Pelham, director of the LMB, said the collaboration would enable scientists from LMB and AstraZeneca ""to do things they wouldn't otherwise do"". Pangalos described it as ""blue sky research"". He highlighted the advantages of being next door to AstraZeneca, so scientists can go back and forth between their labs, and decisions can be made locally. Pelham echoed Pangalos's concerns about the effect of a Pfizer takeover, saying it ""could be disruptive"" with AstraZeneca in the middle of its move. ""This can't help."" But he added pragmatically: ""Whoever is next door to us we will talk to."" Pfizer's president of research and development, Mikael Dolsten, went on a charm offensive in Cambridge's science community on Thursday and met the LMB. Pfizer received a boost on Friday when it submitted a new drug application earlier than expected in the US for a breast cancer treatment, one of its key cancer drugs that has received a breakthrough designation. Scientists working in AstraZeneca's existing MedImmune lab in Cambridge said reassurances from the chief executive, Pascal Soriot, ""help remove the worry"" about a potential takeover – and they are just getting on with their work. AstraZeneca'sThe 13-acre site to the south of Cambridge, where AstraZeneca plans to build a research centre and headquarters housing 2,000 employees, is within walking distance of LMB, hospitals, the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science. Stepping up the pressure on AstraZeneca's shareholders to reject an offer from Pfizer, Swedish government ministers reiterated their worries about ""Pfizer's semi-hostile takeover"" proposal. , the ministers for finance, Anders Borg, enterprise, Annie Lööf, and education and research, Jan Björklund, warned: ""The net increase in Pfizer's workforce has only been roughly 25,000 since 1999, meaning that nearly 100,000 employees have lost their jobs."" The Swedish union Unionen also voiced its opposition to a Pfizer deal in a letter to the Swedish government, saying Sweden needs to unite behind an independent AstraZeneca. Meanwile, in the drugmaker in February, regulatory filings show. The chief executive, Ian Read, sold $10.6m of shares while the chief financial officer, Frank D'Amelio, sold $8.9m of stock and Dolsten offloaded shares worth $2.1m. Pfizer's share price has dropped by 9% to about $29 since Read's and D'Amelio's share sales. This is the typical result of making a takeover bid and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the executives."
1071	1072	Nobel winner tells Pfizer: give us firm promises, and for 10 years 	"ir Paul Nurse, the Nobel prize-winning scientist and president of the Royal Society, has a message for Pfizer, the US drugs company trying to gobble up in the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a British company: ""We don't trust you."" Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, has been desperately trying to win Nurse's support for the proposed £63bn deal. So far he has failed. ""I told them, people don't trust you,"" Nurse said in the Royal Society's John Nash-designed offices overlooking the Mall in central London. ""The public don't trust you. I think the government isn't happy either … and I don't think the scientific community is at all happy."" Winning over the UK's scientists – particularly Nurse, widely regarded as the most influential – is vital if is going to succeed in gaining public and political support for a takeover before a City deadline on 26 May. While it initially appeared that the government would not put any obstacles in the way of the proposed deal, the scale of the backlash from scientists has forced the prime minister and the chancellor to demand ever firmer assurances over British jobs and research. Vince Cable, the business secretary, refused to ""rule out intervention"", and shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna raised the stakes further by saying last week he would block the deal if Labour won next year's general election. Read has declared that the deal will be "" "" and promised to keep 20% of the combined company's research and development jobs in the UK for five years. But Nurse said: ""Read has been nothing but evasive. There's nothing that hasn't been conditional. I haven't heard anything to make me believe he is prepared to make long-term commitments, and without those there is a risk they might just strip it."" Nurse, whose predecessors at the Royal Society include Sir Christopher Wren and Sir Isaac Newton, said the merger could be beneficial for British research and the economy if Pfizer was really in it for the science rather than a quick buck: ""I could imagine it being quite a good deal if they are really serious about investing in the business – a business that is trying to make drugs to cure people."" Looking relaxed in rolled-up shirt sleeves in his palatial Carlton House Terrace office, with sweeping views across St James's Park to Whitehall and the London Eye, Nurse added that combining Pfizer's £40bn cash pile (which it has built up from overseas profits and wants ) with could produce real benefits and open doors all over the world. ""If, on the other hand, they are doing it for short-term share price [gains] and to cut R&D, it can't be good for anybody."" Read was pressed on his pledges over jobs and research in a tense series of parliamentary hearings last week, when one MP reminded him that Pfizer had been likened by former AstraZeneca boss Sir David Barnes to a ""praying mantis"" that ""sucks the lifeblood out of their prey"". The Scottish-American Pfizer chief was forced to admit that, despite his promises, a merger would be followed by . ""I'm not sitting here saying that we can become more efficient without some reduction in jobs,"" he said. Nurse, who is well known in Whitehall for campaigning to protect science spending, demanded a firm commitment from Read on the number of British jobs that would be secured – and for 10 years, not five. ""Drugs can take 20 years to develop,"" he said. ""If you come in offering five years, you're not really taking it seriously. It will take five years for a graduate student of mine to get a PhD."" His warnings prompted MPs on the science and technology select committee to demand longer-term assurances from Pfizer, saying five years was inadequate in an industry that measures progress in decades rather than years. ""Science is a long-term enterprise and it requires a genuinely long-term commitment,"" committee chairman Andrew Miller said in a public letter to science minister David Willetts. ""We are not yet convinced that this is what Pfizer is offering. The government must be willing – and, crucially, able – to hold Pfizer to account if necessary."" Nurse said politicians should also force Pfizer to commit £100m to a new fund to connect the company's research to universities and innovative small businesses: ""If they are serious, they wouldn't mind giving commitments."" He pointed out that Pfizer had cut tens of thousands of jobs following previous takeovers, despite promises to the contrary, and – site of the discovery of Viagra – just three years ago. The 65-year-old scientist conceded that it might be hard for Read to make firm offers before the company has submitted a formal bid. But he said: ""Read is saying he is unable to commit to research without looking at the books properly, but have they looked at the books enough to know what price to offer?"" Nurse said he would tell Read he should be made to commit to something far more legally binding, not just ""a piece of elastic"" about R&D. ""If you are serious about R&D, you would have no hesitation. You would tell your money men and your legal men, 'This is good for business. We'll tie ourselves into this.' They had the opportunity [to do so] in the last two select committees, but they certainly haven't reassured people like me."" Nurse, who won a Nobel prize for a discovery crucial to the understanding of cancer in 2001 and heads the new £700m Francis Crick Institute, said he had the impression that money was the real motivation. He said pharmaceutical companies' constant worrying about short-term share price movements distracted them from their mission to create new medicines, which would be more beneficial to shareholders in the long run. ""Pharma is rapidly getting into a crisis,"" he went on. ""The only way forward it sees is to merge, merge, merge and buy discoveries from somebody because they're not doing it themselves."" He said AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot appeared to be as driven by money as Read, adding that although the French-Australian boss had , he had also indicated he would recommend an offer if the price was high enough. ""They [AstraZeneca] say they have a fiduciary duty to shareholders, so if it's a lot of money – no matter what it means for the company – they will do it. If you were making chocolates or something maybe that is the way to run a business, but we're talking high-tech science. Understanding how humans work in life and disease is complicated."" Nurse said Soriot, a fellow biologist by training, would find it hard not to let a potential £31m personal share-option windfall influence his decision: ""I don't blame him. He would be saintly to turn it down, frankly."""
1073	1074	Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley leaves controversial bonus scheme 	"Sports Direct tycoon has bowed to pressure from the City and withdrawn his controversial participation in the firm's bonus scheme, only a fortnight after winning shareholder approval. Sports Direct in shares to 3,000 permanent staff, including Ashley, if earnings double by 2019. It was Sports Direct's fourth attempt to push through a big payout for its billionaire founder, who owns 58% of the company, and is deputy chairman. Although shareholders voted for the scheme, it ran into trouble almost immediately when leading investors who had opposed the deal began plotting in September. Disgruntled investors were planning to vote against the re-election of chairman Keith Hellawell and other board members. Shortly after announcing Ashley's about-turn, Sports Direct said that non-executive director Charles McCreevy would be stepping down at the shareholder meeting in September. It was not clear on Wednesday if shareholders planned to continue their campaign. Will Pomroy, corporate governance chief of the National Association of Pension Funds, said shareholders were likely to ""continue to engage with the board to discuss concerns in the lead up to the firm's September AGM"". Sports Direct said on Wednesday that Ashley had decided to withdraw from the bonus scheme after discussion with the company's remuneration committee. Hellawell said Ashley was ""fully committed"" to achieving the stretching targets laid down under the scheme and indicated that including the founder of the chain in the plan may have caused unhappiness among staff. ""Following recent unhelpful speculation surrounding his potential allocation, [Ashley] is determined to ensure that there is the maximum number of shares available for the eligible employees,"" he said. Ashley, who acts as executive deputy chairman but does not take a salary, also told the board he was not expecting any bonus plan to be put before shareholders while the current scheme is in place, in effect drawing a line under his bid for a huge payout for the next five years. The U-turn surprised the City. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ""Maybe Mike realised that he would end up getting too much and would thus squeeze out the staff, which would be counter-productive. ""Plenty of people thought Mike Ashley shouldn't need any more motivation, given his huge shareholding in the company, so presumably that is what will keep him going from now on ... For example, a 10p dividend would generate him income of well over £30m, which would keep the wolf from the door."" Other analysts suggested that Ashley was never interested in a payout and had simply enjoyed showing certain elements within the City that he could flex his muscles and win a bonus scheme if he so wished. The climbdown was welcomed by the Institute of Directors. Roger Barker, director of corporate governance, said: ""Mike Ashley is to be congratulated for recognising the governance concerns associated with this pay plan. As a director, senior executive and major shareholder of Sports Direct, he occupies a position of unique influence in the organisation. By taking this step, he is helping improve external perceptions of Sports Direct's governance, which will ultimately be beneficial to all stakeholders."" Ashley's decision to withdraw means Sports Direct's 3,000 full-time employees will get a bigger share of the windfall. However, 90% of staff, who are employed on zero-hours contracts, will get nothing. While Sports Direct has been performing robustly, the bonus saga has left some investors with awkward questions about Sports Direct's leadership. A top 20 shareholder who had intended to vote against the re-election of Hellawell told the Guardian earlier this month: ""The overriding impression created by this episode is of an incredibly weak board."" Sports Direct, which has more than 600 stores in Europe, including 400 in the UK, has just announced , and is expected to unveil another strong set of sales figures on Thursday."
1080	1081	AstraZeneca shareholder calls on board to reverse Pfizer takeover bid rejection 	"A major AstraZeneca shareholder has called on the Anglo-Swedish drugs company to reverse its . , which is one of AstraZeneca's 20 biggest investors, said it was disappointed with the company's ""premature"" rejection of Pfizer's final £55-a-share offer on Monday morning and called on bosses to ""recommence their engagement with Pfizer"". ""Schroders notes with disappointment the quick rejection by the board of the latest offer from Pfizer and the decision of the Pfizer board to draw a premature end to these negotiations by calling their latest proposal final,"" Sue Noffke, manager of Schroders Prime UK equity fund, said. ""As long-term shareholders, we are strong believers in AstraZeneca and the potential for its innovative growth pipeline, however, given the increase in the offer we would encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with , and subsequently their shareholders."" Schroders, which is AstraZeneca's 12th biggest shareholder with a 2% stake, joins other big shareholders AXA Investments and Jupiter Fund Management in publicly criticising AstraZeneca's management. A number of other big investors are also privately expressing anger at the board for rejecting Pfizer's £55-a-share offer without consulting investors. Under City rules, the only way of resurrecting the deal would be if AstraZeneca's shareholders forced the company's board to reconsider the offer. Ian Read, the Pfizer chairman and chief executive, has admitted that there is ""nothing more we can do"". A source close to Pfizer said the company would be amazed if AstraZeneca's shareholders put enough pressure on the board to force it to reconsider the £55-a-share offer before a Takeover Panel deadline on 26 May. ""They would have to make an excruciatingly loud noise,"" the source said. The protest would also have to drown out several big investors – including Aberdeen Asset Management, M&G Investments and Woodford Asset Management – that have spoken in support of AstraZeneca's management. AstraZeneca's shares, which fell 11% following the rejection of the bid on Monday, fell a further 1.25% to £42.34 on Tuesday morning."
1087	1088	Sports Direct investor revolt continues over bonus scheme for founder Ashley 	"Leading investors in Sports Direct will vote against the re-election of the chairman and other board members at September's annual general meeting in protest at the multimillion-pound bonus scheme pushed through this week for the retailer's founder, . Shareholders unhappy about the deal are planning coordinated action through the Association of British Insurers' (ABI) investment committee and the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF). Sports Direct shareholders voted on Wednesday in favour of the scheme, which will give £180m of shares to 3,000 permanent staff, including Ashley, if profits double by 2019. The plan was Sports Direct's fourth attempt to line up a big payout for its billionaire founder, who owns 58% of the company and is deputy chairman. Sports Direct has not revealed how much of the payout will go to Ashley, who did not use his vote. The payout motion was passed despite strong opposition from shareholder groups including the ABI. But big shareholders said Wednesday's vote was not a victory and that instead it left Keith Hellawell, group chairman, Dave Singleton, the remuneration committee chairman, and other directors exposed to a revolt at the annual meeting. A top 20 shareholder of Sports Direct who intends to vote against Hellawell and Singleton said: ""The overriding impression created by this episode is of an incredibly weak board. ""At some stage, Mike Ashley is going to want other shareholders to support him on something, and if relations between him and other shareholders are so poor he may not get that support. This is now a public company and that requires different standards."" Sports Direct declined to comment. Hellawell is the former chief constable of West Yorkshire Police and was a government adviser on drugs. Singleton worked at sports brand Reebok for 25 years before joining the Sports Direct board in 2007. The company's other non-executive directors are Charles McCreevy, the former European commissioner for markets, and Claire Jenkins, an ex-corporate affairs director at Rexam, the packaging company. The company enraged investors after it floated in 2007 because it was not open about its trading, but improved disclosure and booming profits helped to win over critics. Another leading Sports Direct shareholder said they were pleased with the company's business performance, but that they intended to vote against the directors even though Ashley's majority stake made victory unlikely. ""I don't think it [the AGM protest] is anything to do with pay now because we have lost that. It was the process leading up to the vote which shone a light on how the board works. We don't feel we can just sit back and say that is the way it is at this company. We have to express our view to protect ourselves but I don't think Mike Ashley will listen. If he doesn't want those directors off the board it will be one we can't win."" Deborah Gilshan, corporate governance counsel at Railpen, which oversees £20bn of railway pension funds and is a Sports Direct investor, said: ""We will be voting against some of the individual directors because they haven't acted in the best interests of all shareholders. This wasn't just about Sports Direct specifically but about the message it sends to the wider market. It was about the protection of minority shareholders and the integrity of the London market."" Sports Direct said the pay plan had been approved because it toughened up the terms and included Ashley in a scheme for all permanent employees. But pension funds opposed to the deal are asking which fund managers switched votes to support Ashley's latest attempt to secure a big payday. Will Pomroy, NAPF's stewardship and governance lead, said: ""Our members will expect that this is not the end of the matter and attention will now turn to the wider issue of the quality of governance arrangements at Sports Direct."""
1089	1090	Morrisons' former chairman accuses management of ruining supermarket 	"The former chairman of has launched an extraordinary public tirade against the supermarket's leadership, describing the chief executive's strategy as ""bullshit"" and warning that the business founded by his father had been ruined. Sir Ken Morrison, 82, tore into Morrisons boss Dalton Philips in a scathing intervention at the retailer's annual general meeting. After watching Philips outline his strategy to modernise the Bradford-based chain, Morrison told the chief executive: ""When I left work and started working as a hobby, I chose to raise cattle. I have something like 1,000 bullocks and, having listened to your presentation, Dalton, you've got a lot more bullshit than me."" Dressed in his trademark striped company tie, Morrison's outburst drew loud applause from hundreds of independent shareholders in the meeting at the company's Bradford headquarters as he picked apart the record of Philips and his management colleagues. He said the supermarkets had been neglected in favour of ill-conceived ventures into babywear retailing, convenience stores and selling online. ""A really first-class business has been ruined by a lack of leadership from the top,"" said Morrison, who built his father's grocery shop into a national chain before stepping down in 2008. ""The results have been described by the chairman and the chief executive as disappointing. I personally thought they were disastrous."" Over the past three months alone Morrisons has reported a 7.1% slump in sales – . When Philips joined Morrisons in 2010 the business did not have a website or convenience stores, which are the industry's fastest-growing sales channels. Morrison's comments came as shareholders registered a significant protest vote against the management team who have presided over a 27% fall in the FTSE 100 company's share price over the past year. According to initial voting returns, 14% of those voting voted against Philips's re-election, 10.7% registered a protest against the chairman, Sir Ian Gibson, and 26.5% against the remuneration policy. Gibson announced at the AGM he would stand down next year. But he denied he had felt under pressure to do so, saying he decided to announce his departure to ""clear up any speculation and uncertainty"" and put an ""orderly plan"" in place. In the packed meeting a chorus of former and current employee-shareholders, family members and small investors, some of whom had travelled a considerable distance to attend, criticised the company for a series of strategic missteps, particularly the purchase of baby goods retailer Kiddicare which cost it £163m in profit writedowns. Several shareholders called for the board to step down and for more attention to be given to standards in the big supermarkets which form the core of Morrisons' business. Chris Blundell, Morrison's nephew and a former Morrisons director, added: ""I think we're in a rescue situation here and it needs urgent action. Things need to be done very quickly. We are losing our reputation. A reputation is everything in business and I think you've lost that to a great extent."" Gibson said the business was suffering alongside many of its rivals amid dramatic changes in the way shoppers buy their groceries. But he said that over the past few years Morrisons had performed well against its peers, with improved profits, free cash flow and strong dividends. ""This company is not in a rescue situation. It's a very sound business that is in the process of still growing,"" he said. He admitted that buying Kiddicare and particularly 10 large stores for its expansion was a mistake but said mistakes had been made in previous generations at the company. In a remark clearly aimed at Sir Ken, he said: ""We are still paying for some of those [mistakes]. To have to launch online 16 to 14 years after the competition, not knowing anything about IT as a consequence, is one of the problems."" Gibson's planned departure in a year's time could increase the pressure on Philips to produce results that will impress a new chairman. Philips, who admitted it was his toughest annual shareholder meeting in his four years in charge of the business, said: ""There's a well documented difference on strategy between Sir Ken and myself. My job is to deliver on the strategy we have outlined to shareholders with their support."" While the founding family's comments could revive speculation that they are planning a bid for the company, Morrison appeared to pour cold water on the idea. He said: ""I'm far too old to consider anything of that manner and other members of the family have got other interests."""
1092	1093	Ryanair profits endure bumpy landing with first drop in five years 	" has admitted it was ""asleep at the wheel"" when passengers started to turn against the airline's attitude to customer service. Reporting its first drop in annual profits in five years, the carrier admitted that rival easyJet had responded more quickly to a changing world. Howard Millar, deputy chief executive of Ryanair, said: ""The low fares industry has evolved. It wasn't enough to do just low fares. During that period we weren't listening or were asleep at the wheel but we have learned a lot."" Ryanair has moved to improve its reputation for customer service and revamp its image over the past year with a range of changes, after chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline would no longer ""unnecessarily piss people off"". Profits after tax were down 8% to €523m (£426.5m) in the year to 31 March, after fares dropped 4% and fuel costs rose. Millar denied that the airline's rockier year could be directly attributed to a ""tarnished"" Ryanair image. ""It was something that was experienced across the market. Virtually every carrier reported fares not rising."" However, he said: ""It did spur us to have a closer look at what competitors were doing. We were always listening ... [But] we asked more detailed questions. "" Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: ""There were improvements we wanted to make. Some elements if we had done them sooner it would have helped. We're moving ahead quickly."" The airline said its rapidly improving approach to customer service and upgraded website had boosted bookings, with allocated seating boosting sales and proving popular with passengers. Other changes have included the relaxing of cabin bag restrictions, lower charges, and less stringent booking conditions. Bookings are higher for the year ahead, with fares and revenues rising over the summer on the back of stronger demand. Fares would rise around 2% overall this year, Ryanair said. The airline, which operates more than 1,600 routes from 68 bases, flew 81.7 million passengers in 2013-14 and forecasts a 4% rise in numbers for 2014. It expects profits to recover to between €580m and €620m next year, and plans to pay shareholders a €500m dividend in spring. Analysts said Ryanair management's guidance appeared cautious for the year ahead. However, Gerald Khoo of Liberum Capital said the new Ryanair was not as lean as before: ""The attempt to reposition the business appears to have brought additional costs."" He said these included higher pay rises, deals with more expensive airports and higher marketing spend. From September Ryanair will receive the first planes in an order of 180 737s it has placed with Boeing, launching a new period of rapid expansion. Millar claimed that factors including a stronger euro against the dollar meant that these planes would be cheaper than when Ryanair had first bought aircraft from the American manufacturer back in 1999. The airline anticipates carrying almost 40% more passengers by 2019, which would see it fly 112 million people per year. Ryanair will be targeting more primary airports around Europe – rather than out-of-the-way secondary airports – as it starts to focus on the business passengers that have swelled EasyJet's numbers in recent years. As a result Ryanair is considering introducing a more flexible business fare."
1096	1097	Sports Direct forced to advertise zero-hours contract terms 	Sports Direct will be forced to advertise the limited employment terms under its zero-hours contracts following legal action brought by a former employee. Under a settlement agreed before a tribunal due to be heard next month, the retailer will have to make clear in job adverts, contracts and staff rooms that it does not guarantee work under the controversial terms under which nearly 90% of its staff are employed and produce clear written policies setting out what sick pay and paid holiday their zero hours staff are entitled to. Zahera Gabriel-Abrahem, an ex-Sports Direct worker who was employed on a zero hours contract, claimed that part-time staff are treated less favourably than full-time employees at Sports Direct. She said: “The new job advertisements will mean that people will not find themselves in a situation where what you think are getting isn’t what you actually get. “It was really important to me that these changes happened before the company’s Christmas recruitment round and that has been achieved.” Gabriel-Abrahem left the retailer’s Croydon branch in July last year after suffering panic attacks, which she blamed on a lack of financial security as her contract offered no guaranteed work or income. Her legal action was backed by the financial support of more than 5,000 members of the campaign group 38 Degrees. The law firm Leigh Day, which represented Gabriel-Abrahem, said that while Sports Direct would continue to use zero-hours contracts, the public nature of its promises was important because it meant the company could be called to account if it did not make the terms they involved clear to workers. “Zero-hours workers are not second-class workers,” said Elizabeth George, a barrister at Leigh Day. “They have the right to be treated fairly and with respect. They have the right to take holidays and to be paid when they take them. They have the right to statutory sick pay. They have a right to request guaranteed hours. “Sports Direct will now have to make that crystal clear to staff. By doing so the risk of those rights being ignored or misunderstood by managers will be significantly reduced in the future.” Sports Direct said that the settlement was made without admission of any liability whatsoever. “It was clear from the proceedings that we and Ms Gabriel-Abraham felt equally strongly about our respective positions and that each had different perceptions of the events that took place. The company will continue the process of reviewing, updating and improving our core employment documents and procedures across our entire business beyond its existing compliant framework,” Sports Direct said in a statement. Sports Direct continues to face further legal action from zero-hours workers who were excluded from a multimillion-pound bonus scheme which was only handed to “permanent” workers. About 300 claims have now been gathered in a partnership between Leigh Day and workers’ rights group Pay Justice. The claim, expected to be filed early next year, could lead to a £4m-plus bill for Sports Direct and many of those taking part in the action continue to be employed by Sports Direct. Alison McGovern, the Labour MP who has campaigned against zero-hours terms said: “It’s hard to understand why Sports Direct are so determined not to give people regular hours. What have they got against people knowing what money they can expect at the end of the week?” The Labour party has pledged to give greater rights to staff who have been on the contracts for longer than six months. The business secretary, Vince Cable, has warned “unscrupulous employers” that he plans to ban clauses in zero-hours contracts that prevent workers from accepting shifts with more than one employer. This article was amended on 27 May 2015. An earlier version said Sports Direct would have to make clear that it did not guarantee sick pay or holiday pay to zero-hours workers. That has been amended to say it was required to produce clear written policies setting out what sick pay and paid holiday those workers were entitled to.
1099	1100	AstraZeneca at risk from Pfizer tax avoidance plans, says company chief 	"Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of , has stepped up his attack on the business model of Pfizer, the US drugs company stalking the UK business, and warned that the British drugs group could be damaged by Pfizer's tax avoidance plans. , which has proposed a £63bn takeover of the UK business, intends to use the AstraZeneca deal to relocate its tax base to the UK. The move is designed to move away from the US's higher rate of corporation tax, but US Democratic senators angered by the strategy have expressed determination to close this legal loophole. Soriot told the Guardian on Thursday: ""The risk is that if it turns into a controversy our own company would be impacted by it. Even if we were to agree a [takeover] deal, it takes eight to 10 months to close it. ""If this controversy leads to a delay, you have to remember the shareholders of Pfizer can still vote no. Imagine we go through this entire process of waiting, a lot of anxiety in our employees' minds, lots of distraction, , potential controversy surrounding us and in the end the deal doesn't happen and we are left flailing in the wind."" Soriot also hit back at Pfizer's pledge to ringfence work on important medicines and criticised the US group's plan to split the combined business into three separate divisions. ""It's all very well to say we will ringfence, but what does it mean, ringfencing? You have to understand precisely how you would do that. The model where you would split the company in three pieces I don't think would work at all for our business."" He pointed to AstraZeneca's MedImmune arm in Cambridge, which specialises in immunology – coming up with drugs for immune diseases and cancer – and designing antibodies for cancer, respiratory and other diseases. ""It's impossible – you can't split MedImmune into three pieces."" The proposed takeover has sparked deep-seated concerns within the science community and at Westminster about the impact on UK research. has said he is not satisfied with Pfizer's pledges to protect jobs and research, while business secretary Vince Cable has refused to rule out intervention in the bid although he admits it would be ""tricky"" for the government to act. The chair of the House of Commons science select committee, on Thursday to express his growing concerns about the takeover. His letter was sent just hours after the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, signed a decree giving the Paris government new powers to block foreign takeover bids for companies deemed ""strategic"". A large part of one of France's leading companies, Alstom, is currently the target of another large US corporation, GE. EU competition chief Joaquín Almunia, however, said the UK government has not approached him so far over a change to British law on a ""public interest"" test that might be used to protect AstraZeneca against Pfizer's bid. Soriot admitted that if AstraZeneca were a French business, the government would be playing a much bigger part in the negotiations. The French-born Australian, who has led AstraZeneca for 18 months, said: ""There would be a massive controversy for sure – just look at the controversy that is happening around Alstom."" However, he refused to ask the British government to intervene to help protect the UK company, which is responsible for 2% of the country's exports, saying: ""Every country has to develop its own national policy."" Speculation is now mounting that Pfizer is close to coming back with a higher offer intended to force AstraZeneca's board to the negotiating table. Soriot, however, said that price was not the only factor to consider: ""We're very much aware of our fiduciary duty and we'll make sure we consider an offer that is a good offer for our shareholders.""But some people read from this that we are ready to sell, the deal will happen and it's only a question of price. Absolutely not. This deal is not inevitable. ""We have a strategy that works, we have the critical mass to succeed, we are one of the largest pharmaceutical companies – how big do you need to be?"" Pfizer boss Ian Read spent a second day touring City investors on Thursday to press the case for his bid. Soriot was meanwhile attempting to woo his shareholders – many of whom are also big Pfizer investors – by talking up AstraZeneca's cancer pipeline. He said the value of the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker's pipeline will crystallise in the company's share price long before 2023. By that date the company expects a 75% uplift in annual revenues to more than $45bn. Soriot pointed to other companies that have turned themselves around – such as Bristol Myers-Squibb in the US. Analysts believe Pfizer will raise its proposal to £53-£55 a share from £50 two weeks ago. One large investor said: ""The ball is now in Pfizer's court to see if they can find an offer which brings Astra to the table. They can go hostile, though that is risky. ""We have indicated that we think [AstraZeneca] should consider, talking but there needs to be an inducement to talk and in that sense it's Pfizer decision."" AstraZeneca has not suffered any setbacks through drugs failing in development in the last eight months. Soriot noted that lung drug AZD9291, which new data shows shrank tumours in over half of patients, the cancer immunotherapy PD-L1 treatment, and asthma medicines benralizumab and tralokinumab, have all been engineered in Cambrige. ""We are very much rooted in science in this country."" AstraZeneca's defence was strengthened by the release of promising clinical data ahead of a key cancer US conference, which Soriot, a biologist, plans to attend. He reminded his shareholders that they would receive cash and shares in the new company, which is why its strategy and integration are crucial. ""Would it be a strategy that is science led with an investment in R&D or would it be a strategy of: we cut costs and we maximise short-term cashflow?"" Meanwhile, shows that Pfizer is already dominant in over 80% of the therapeutic areas of both companies combined. Given the vast overlap, ""it is unlikely that AstraZeneca's R&D departments will feel secure about their futures."""
1101	1102	Burberry set for tough reception over chief executive's pay packet 	" is braced for a substantial protest vote at Friday's annual general meeting after the British luxury brand angered investors with a more than £20m pay deal for new chief executive Christopher Bailey. Investor groups Pirc and the Investment Management Association (IMA) have flagged their concerns ahead of the event with proxy voting firm Manifest giving the company's pay policy and report a ""D"". In the past companies that have attracted that type of criticism have suffered protest votes of around 30%. ""I think there will be a significant no vote but I don't think it will be a majority,"" said one investor. ""There seems to be a lack of clear linkage between pay and performance. Christopher Bailey has been a very successful creative director but there is no guarantee he will be a successful chief executive and Burberry are paying him as if he already is one."" In May the Guardian revealed details of Bailey's contract which includes a £440,000 cash allowance. Other elements of his remuneration include a £1.1m salary, an annual cash bonus of up to twice that salary and share awards of up to four times salary. Last summer the company also handed Bailey a one-off award of free shares worth almost £15m. ""The cash allowance isn't the key issue,"" said Manifest chief executive Sarah Wilson. ""Very few companies in the FTSE 100 have such poor pay governance procedures so Burberry's approach is going to have disappointed many shareholders."" Pirc, which has advised shareholders to vote against the company's remuneration policy, warned, among other things, that executive directors' incentive schemes are ""excessive"" as potential payouts could be more than eight times their base salary. In turn the IMA, whose members manage £4.5tn of assets, issued an ""amber top"" alert over pay – its second most serious level of rebuke on corporate governance. The shareholder meeting comes hot on the heels of a strong set of figures from the trenchcoat-maker. On Thursday Burberry said like-for-like sales rose 12% in the three months to 30 June which was ahead of analysts forecasts of around 8%. There was a sting in the tail, however, with finance director Carol Fairweather warning the strong pound would take a bigger bite out of profits this year than previously thought. Burberry's fixed costs are in Sterling but its revenues are in a variety of currencies with adverse movements expected to reduce annual profits by £65m rather than £50m previously outlined. That did not dent investors' enthusiasm for the company with Burberry the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 with the shares closing up more than 3% at £14.64. Bailey, who to date has been reticent in his dealings with the business press, did not join a conference call with journalists but said in a statement: ""This first quarter performance reflects our focus on striving to give customers the best possible experience of the Burberry brand through ongoing investment in retail, digital and service, both on and offline. The 12% increase in comparable sales demonstrates our teams' success in unlocking the benefits of these investments, as we continue to concentrate on the things we can control in an uncertain external environment."" Larger rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci have seen sales start to slow as big spenders tire of global brands that are too ubiquitous. Demand in China, a key luxury goods market, has also been hit by a government crackdown on corruption and conspicuous spending. However Burberry bucked that trend to report growth of more than 10% in the Asia Pacific region ""led by mainland China"". Burberry's continued success is in part down to its willingness to embrace the digital fashion revolution. It streams its catwalk shows online and in stores, allowing customers to order products for early delivery with a personalised touch, such as an engraved nameplate in a coat or bag. A presence on Chinese social media sites such as Sina Weibo (the country's version of Twitter), Youku (similar to YouTube) and Douban has also helped Burberry outperform rival brands in the region. Barclays analyst Julian Easthope believes the Burberry figures will turn out to be the best of its peer group over the period: ""This was despite a tough comparison with last year and reflects the group's ability to convert traffic both online and offline thanks to its investment in retail, digital and customer service."""
1104	1105	Morrisons shocks markets with huge fall in sales 	" boss Dalton Philips has unveiled the biggest slump in sales at a listed supermarket in a generation with a trading update underlining the scale of the task to win back lost shoppers. Poor trade over the key Easter holiday period contributed to a 7.1% slump in like-for-like sales at the Bradford-based chain. Analysts said the underlying picture was even worse and estimated that sales volumes had fallen by up to 10% in the main supermarket chain. ""I've been doing this job for 20 years and I can't remember a worse performance by a mass-market supermarket,"" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. ""Even in the 80s and 90s, I can't recall a big supermarket with sales down this much."" In March, Philips issued a massive profit warning designed to give the supermarket the financial firepower to slash prices and take on the discounters. It is investing £1bn in price cuts over the next three years, with the plan expected to halve profits to £325m-£375m this year. A first round of price cuts on basics such as milk, broccoli and chicken was followed by a second more high-profile push last week which cut prices on 1,200 products by an average of 17%. The new price reductions, which will cost £300m, are backed by a major advertising campaign – the supermarket projected in Gateshead to get its message out. Philips said it was too early to judge whether the price cuts were working as it would take six months for customers to be reassured that the discounts were not a gimmick. With price reductions eating into revenue, Philips said the sales trend would continue to be negative. He asked the City to judge progress instead on the number of shoppers Morrisons attracts and how many items they put in their basket. Philips said the initial response to the new prices had been ""very positive"". The shares closed up 8p at 199p. The company has lost a quarter of its value this year with the shares now trading at close to an eight-year low. Despite the problems Philips insisted shareholders were still backing him with the new plan receiving ""broad support"". He said there was also pressure to deliver as shareholders would ""hold our feet to the fire in terms of execution"". When Philips joined Morrisons in 2010 he inherited a business without a website or convenience stores, which together are the industry's fastest-growing sales channels. He has made inroads into both with the launch of the M Local chain – which will have 200 stores by the end of the year – and an alliance with online grocer Ocado that has enabled it to launch a home delivery service in Warwickshire and Yorkshire. The Morrisons.com service will be rolled out to London on Monday with the two businesses on track to deliver annual sales of more than £500m, according to the company. But Philips's credibility has been stretched thin as the performance worsens at the core of the Morrisons business, its traditional supermarkets. The 7.1% decline for the 13 weeks to 4 May was worse than analysts' forecasts of a near 6% drop and was even worse than the reduction over the key Christmas trading period, when like-for-like sales fell 5.6%. Philips admitted it was outflanked over the important Easter holiday weekend. ""We were disappointed,"" he said. ""It wasn't a strong Easter for us. ""Those customers that had traditionally traded out of the discounters into Morrisons weren't doing it at Christmas and they didn't do it at Easter either."" This week industry data from Kantar Worldpanel showed that Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's had all lost market share over the past three months as Aldi and Lidl continued to gain ground. The discounters' incursions add to the challenges faced by Philips, who is trying to turnaround the business at a time when grocery sales are rising at their slowest pace in more than a decade."
1141	1142	Tesco to be investigated by FCA over accounting scandal 	The UK’s top financial regulator has launched a full-scale investigation into the £250m . The (FCA) informed Tesco on Tuesday about the investigation, which will start by examining whether the company broke rules on accurate financial disclosure but it could widen to take in possible criminal misconduct. The regulator has the power to prosecute people who make deliberately or recklessly misleading statements to the stock exchange. said last week that it was in contact with the FCA. Tesco commissioned Deloitte, the accountants, and the law firm Freshfields to carry out an independent inquiry. In a statement to the stock exchange, the UK’s biggest retailer said: “The Financial Conduct Authority has notified Tesco that it has commenced a full investigation following the overstatement of expected profit for the half year which was described in our announcement of 22 September 2014 and which is currently the subject of an independent review by Deloitte. Tesco will continue to cooperate fully with the FCA and other relevant authorities considering this matter.” Last week, Tesco stunned investors by announcing that a whistleblower had alerted its most senior lawyer to over-optimistic accounting for payments from suppliers and business costs. The group admitted it had overstated its expected first-half profits by £250m. The statement came three weeks after a trading update that predicted first-half profit would be £1.1bn, down from £1.6bn a year earlier. Tesco’s shares have fallen every day since last Monday’s announcement and have lost more than a fifth of their value in that time. They were down 3% at 179p in afternoon trading. Sainsbury’s put further pressure on Tesco over the error by saying it was confident its own commercial revenues were properly recorded. Sainsbury’s finance director John Rogers said: It was a “gross misrepresentation that this is a grey area of subjectivity. The accounting rules are clearly defined.” The Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, and the Serious Fraud Office are also monitoring events at the group. Tesco’s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, , including the head of Tesco’s UK food business, when the accounting irregularity was discovered. After joining from Unilever at the start of last month he is battling to steady the giant retailer, which some analysts say is now too destabilised to invest in. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said: “Such an investigation (by the FCA) can only be another distraction for new CEO Dave Lewis and represents another black mark on the board.”
1142	1143	Benedict Cumberbatch in line to play Julian Assange in biopic 	Benedict Cumberbatch is in line to play Julian Assange in a forthcoming biopic about the WikiLeaks founder, . Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks studio is basing its film on the books , by Guardian writers David Leigh and Luke Harding, and , written by Assange's former right-hand man Daniel Domscheit-Berg. Both books were optioned by the studio last year. Deadline says Joel Kinnaman of the US version of The Killing, who was recently cast as the new Robocop, could play Domscheit-Berg. The casting news suggests that Jeremy Renner, who had previously been tipped to play Assange, is no longer in the running. Bill Condon, the man behind and , remains the studio's first choice to direct. Assange is currently holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has claimed political asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sex-crime accusations. His lawyer has argued that his client would not receive a fair trial, and Assange also fears he could face extradition to the United States. The WikiLeaks film was previously reported to be pitched somewhere between and , and is one of a number of mooted projects about Assange doing the rounds. Others include an Australian TV movie, in which Anthony LaPaglia plays a cop tracking the young Assange as he embarks on his early career as a hacker in Melbourne, a fictional account of the activist's adventures in internet dating by director Cyril Tuschi, and . Cumberbatch has so much work on his plate that fans of his turn as Sherlock Holmes in the BBC TV series may be wondering how he plans to fit series three into his schedule. The British actor plays a headline-grabbing villain role in the next Star Trek film, titled Into Darkness, and is , and the Necromancer in . He will also star in Steve McQueen's Twelve Years a Slave, and has a role lined up in the forthcoming big-screen adaptation of the Pulitzer and Tony-winning play opposite Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts.
1154	1155	AbbVie-Shire takeover at risk following US calls to halt tax inversion 	"Fresh calls for a US crackdown on so-called tax inversion have hit shares in British pharmaceutical firm , which is trying to hammer out a £31bn deal with US suitor AbbVie. The news comes at a time of intense negotiations ahead of Friday's formal 5pm bid deadline and both sides are likely to seek protective clauses in the agreement in case the deal later falls apart over this issue. AbbVie wants to shift its tax base from the US to Britain as part of the deal, a move that would cut its effective corporation tax rate from 22% to 13% by 2016. The Chicago based drug firm is one of a string of US companies looking to redomicile abroad to save billions on tax, most notably . But the US treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, urged the leaders of the congressional tax-writing committees to act now to stop US firms redomiciling for tax purposes. He wrote: ""Congress should enact legislation immediately – and make it retroactive to May 2014 – to shut down this abuse of our tax system,"" . Lew called for comprehensive business tax reform to lower the US corporate tax rate, broaden the tax base, close loopholes and simplify the tax system. Shares in Shire were the second-biggest faller on the FTSE 100 indexclosing down 79p at £47.86, a 1.6% fall. AbbVie, which makes the world's top-selling drug Humira for rheumatoid arthritis, and Shire, known for its hyperactivity treatments, have been in ""detailed talks"" since (its fifth) on Monday, despite harbouring doubts over the tax structure. Shire is likely to be pushing for a sizeable reverse break fee in the event the deal collapses. AbbVie, for its part, may want to add a clause that allows both sides to walk away if the US clamps down on tax inversion. It is also taking a closer look at Shire's drug pipeline in light of its forecast that it can double revenues to $10bn by 2020. As both sides have agreed on the price of a deal – although the mix of the shares-and-cash offer could still change – the UK Takeover Panel is likely to grant an extension of the deadline if this is requested. Shire's chief executive Flemming Ornskov, who took the reins in January 2013, could land a windfall of up to £21m if the deal goes through at £53.20 a share and all his long term incentive schemes pay out. His predecessor, Angus Russell, owns shares worth £21m in the company, while the former finance director, Graham Hetherington, who left in March, could pocket nearly £30m from his shareholdings and long-term awards. Two days ago, the US drugmaker Mylan clinched a $5.3bn (£3.9bn) deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' generic drugs business in developed markets outside the US, with plans to transfer the assets to a new firm set up in the Netherlands so that Mylan can shift its tax base there. UK baby goods chain Mothercare has rejected two takeover proposals from US rival Destination Maternity, which wants to incorporate the combined business in Britain. . President Barack Obama included in his latest budget a proposal to ensure that companies cannot change their corporate tax domicile without a change in control of the company itself. About 50 US firms have reincorporated overseas through inversion over the last decade, most of them since 2008. US lawmakers remain divided on the issue. Republicans as well as some influential Democrats in Congress favour a comprehensive overhaul of the tax regime to limit inversions, with some warning that a quick fix could lead to competitive disadvantages for US companies. Even Democratic senator Ron Wyden, who chairs the Senate finance committee and urged in May that ""this [inversion] loophole must be plugged,"" has not pushed for a quick fix. At the weekend, that break promises on protecting jobs and investment after taking over British businesses. He said the government may go even further and widen the public interest test to offer British companies greater protection against hostile takeovers. AbbVie's approach to Shire has not led to the same job fears as Pfizer's abortive bid for AstraZeneca did."
1161	1162	Sainsbury's sales fall again amid sluggish retail environment 	"Outgoing Sainsbury's boss revealed a second quarter of falling sales but insisted he is ""not leaving on a low"" because the grocer is still outperforming its rivals. In King's last trading update before he quits next month, Sainsbury's said sales at stores open a year or more were down 1.1%, excluding fuel, in the last three months. The widely anticipated sales fall follows a decline in the previous three months which broke a nine-year unbroken record of growth. Last week unveiled a 3.8% plunge in recent sales – its worst performance in three decades. Like other major supermarkets, Sainsbury's has been hit by increasing competition from budget grocers Aldi and Lidl and a general slowdown in the grocery market as cash-strapped shoppers keep a tight rein on their weekly grocery bill. King said Sainsbury's underlying sales had been hit as a result of going ""toe-to-toe"" with rivals on prices of basic foods such as bread and milk. At the same time the price of fruit and vegetables had come down because of good harvests compared with last year. Sainsbury's has steered clear of the eye-catching price cutting campaigns used by rivals Morrisons, Asda and Tesco, but King insisted the retailer was not being left behind. ""We have the strongest price position in a very long time,"" King said. ""I'd have preferred sales to be growing but I'm not leaving on a low. Total sales are growing and we delivered a performance in the context of a market that is growing at the lowest level in 10 years. Our outperformance if anything was a bit stronger in the last quarter than it has been in a while."" Unlike listed competitors Tesco and Morrisons, which have warned of sales declines, Sainsbury's expects to see a slight lift in underlying sales this year of about 0.2%. But it was less confident on profits. Finance director John Rogers admitted that the very broad spread of analysts' expectations, which range from £571m to £871m – compared with £798m last year – appropriately reflected ""uncertainty in the market given what could happen in the coming months"". Analysts and even Sainsbury's seem unsure about the likely extent of a price war and how much this will cost the supermarket this year. King said Sainsbury's was likely to shout more about its lower prices in future as analysts said it had the most to lose if bigger rival Tesco cut prices more aggressively. Mike Coupe, who takes over from King on 9 July, said Sainsbury's would not be changing its ""underlying principles"" which were based on ""great prices, great quality and closely adhered-to values which set apart our proposition."" Sainsbury's total sales rose 1% as it opened 27 convenience stores to meet changing shopping habits as customers opt for more frequent but smaller purchases instead of visiting out-of-town stores. Sales from the small Sainsbury's Local shops rose 18% while online sales of groceries increased 10% and strong non-food sales helped to offset a decline in groceries. Clothing like-for-like sales were up by a ""double-digit"" figure, Sainsbury's said. But analysts pointed out that Sainsbury's large stores, which form the core of the business, were seeing underlying sales fall by more than 3% despite the company spending £1bn on refurbishing, opening or extending stores last year. Dave McCarthy at HSBC said shoppers were more enticed by low prices than they were by glamorous-looking stores or the internet and all the major retailers needed to invest more in price cuts. ""Aldi's market share alone is growing faster than Sainsbury, Tesco, Morrisons, Asda, Waitrose and Ocado combined are winning on the internet,"" he said. King said Aldi and Lidl's success was as much to do with the fact that they were opening more handy local stores as it was price. But Bryan Roberts, director of retail insights at consultancy Kantar Retail, said: ""With Tesco desperately seeking recovery and the Co-op poised to raise its game, Sainsbury's could face further pressure in the coming months and quarters. If Sainsbury's has any decent strategic aces up its sleeve, now might be the time to play them."""
1162	1163	Samsung plans to sue Dyson over 'copycat' allegations on vacuum cleaner 	Samsung Electronics has filed a lawsuit demanding 10bn Korean won (£5.6m) in compensation from the British appliance maker Dyson because it claims it was depicted as a copycat. The lawsuit, filed last week in the Seoul district court in Korea, were filed against Dyson because its “previous litigation has hurt Samsung’s corporate image”, the company . The move follows the decision by Dyson in October 2013 to drop a , in which it claimed that the Korean giant had copied the steering system used in its Motion Sync cleaner from the Dyson DC37 and DC39 cleaners, which had then been on sale for two years. Samsung was able to defend itself against Dyson’s case by presenting “prior art” - an example of the idea being used before Dyson had patented it. Samsung said when the lawsuit was withdrawn that it would establish the damage to its brand image and whether to act. Now it has. “We are initially seeking 10bn won from the UK-based manufacturer. However, the amount will increase depending on how the court proceedings go,” Samsung’s spokesperson told the Korea Times. “Samsung’s marketing activities were negatively affected by Dyson’s groundless litigation, which is intolerable.” A Dyson spokesperson said that it had not received a copy of the formal complaint. “We’re not apologising,” he added. It is not the first time that Samsung Electronics has been accused of copying a rival. A high-profile case against Apple began in 2011 with an that some Samsung phone and tablet designs “slavishly copies” that of early models of the iPhone smartphone and iPad tablet. Apple won the case relating to copying of the appearance of the iPhone 3GS, though not its iPad. When Dyson filed its suit in August, its chief executive James Dyson said: “Although they are copying Dyson’s patented technology, their machine is not the same. Samsung has many patent lawyers so I find it hard not to believe that this is a deliberate or utterly reckless infringement of our patent.” Following the latest salvo from Samsung, Dyson said in a statement: “Dyson pioneered cyclonic vacuum cleaners and digital motors – and has been developing them ever since. We patent our technology, and naturally defend it. It is surprising that a company over 100 times bigger than Dyson is so worried. The patent system offers us some protection but not enough: with an army of lawyers, hidden prior art is occasionally found and ways to design around existing patents identified.” James Dyson has been a fierce defender of patents and intellectual property, fighting and winning a number of high-profile court cases to defend innovations in the company’s products. In 2012, it accused German rival Bosch of planting a spy in its research lab – claims that the company denied. Dyson has also taken a tough line against Chinese firms and challenged Chinese-owned Vax over the appearance of a product that Dyson felt looked similar to Dyson’s DC02 cleaner. The claims against Vax were rejected by the British courts. This article was amended on 19 February 2014 to correct a description of the lawsuit.
1168	1169	Corporate inversion - moving the head office for tax purposes 	"A corporate inversion occurs when a multinational group moves its notional head office, often for tax purposes, from its home jurisdiction to an overseas territory. The impact on operations is often minimal, with manufacturing activities and the markets in which it operates remaining unchanged. However, combined with a web of crossborder transactions between companies owned by the same group, such inversions can play an important role in shifting profits within an international business to low-tax jurisdictions, boosting returns for shareholders. Inversions are particularly attractive to US companies who are making substantial profits beyond American shores. In part, this is because of the US taxman's unique approach to the taxation of multinationals. On the one hand, the tax treatment ofsuch firms has often driven overseas success because it encourages firms to make profits abroad. On the other,the tax regime leaves many of America's leading multinational groups – such as Apple and Amazon – straining to avoid repatriating profits . At the end of last year AbbVie reported $21bn (£12.3bn) of ""undistributed earnings"" from overseas subsidiaries, up from $19.4bn the previous year – funds declared for US tax purposes that would be ""indefinitely reinvested"" abroad and should therefore not be taxed in America. itself carried out a corporate inversion in 2008 when it moved certain headquarter activities from Basingstoke, in Hampshire, to Dublin, as well as incorportating in Jersey. That move followed the then Labour government's efforts to strengthen HMRC's ability to capture the profits the UK multinationals were seeking to shift into overseas subsidiaries. Those efforts failed in the European courts. Nonetheless, Shire did not reverse the move after the reforms were derailed. The company has since adopted what are widely viewed as some of the most generous tax treatments for multinationals and their overseas subsidiaries - measures which have helped make the UK a possible inversion base for many American groups. Other US healthcare multinationals drawn recently to corporate inversion include , although its takeover approach for AstraZeneca was ultimately rebuffed. More successful has been Medotronic, which last month agreed a $42.9bn deal to buy fellow medical device maker Covidien, a takeover that will relocate the combined group to the latter's Irish corporate home."
1173	1174	Sainsbury’s - what the analysts say 	Sainsbury’s in what many see as the toughest grocery market for decades. Mike Coupe, the new chief executive, announced the news in his first presentation to the City since taking over at the supermarket group. “With another quarter of declining like-for-likes, Sainsbury’s now knows for certain that it is in a fight. In recent years, Sainsbury’s has almost been observing the battle of the grocers from a privileged field position, but now it’s in the trenches with everyone else. Sainsbury’s is increasingly being caught in a pincer movement between the aggressive discounters and the higher-end grocers such as . Sainsbury’s can take comfort from the fact that everyone else is in the same fight, but it does feel like it could have better capitalised on the woes of Tesco. What’s not in doubt is that the next few years will be critical in the long-term future of the UK grocery sector. We’re witnessing a major shakedown.” “With these results, it’s increasingly clear [Sainsbury’s chief executive] Mike Coupe took the hospital pass just like Philip Clarke [at Tesco]. Yes, convenience and online may be moving in the right direction but the rot is setting in. With everyone reducing prices and food inflation low, Sainsbury’s has got its work cut out. Cash-strapped consumers are reining in on discretionary spending and increasingly deserting the big boys for the low-cost discounters, or treating themselves to a premium upmarket experience in Waitrose. Who needs Sainsbury’s, or Waitrose even, when you can get £9.99 Beluga Caviar at ? Expect this situation to go on for years, with the low-cost discounters the only winners. The only limit is how many stores they can open. Who would be the chief executive of a big four supermarket chain? With the exception of Asda, all are losing market share.” “As a matter of prudence we have downgraded future dividend expectations for subsequent years to a flat out-turn, a pay-out that will depend upon the profit performance of the group and management’s strategic review; this may yet be too optimistic. Hence we will need to keep a close eye on the dividend payment credentials of Sainsbury’s noting that c£330m of cash cost is not expected to be covered by free cash flow in future years with ongoing capital expenditure of c£750m. Costs, capital expenditure and/or the dividend may need to be cut ... Change is taking place, e.g. Sainsbury’s movements on price last week and its opening of Netto stores (five by the financial year-end), indicating the commencement of a fightback and an end to the “free-lunch” enjoyed by the limited assortment discounters at the expense of the multiples.” “Assuming the industry like-for-like sales were trending down 4% then Sainsbury’s is still making progress. Our view is that Sainsbury’s new CEO, Mike Coupe, needs to explain the changes to brand match, now focusing on pricing, and how that works better with their value simplicity pricing strategy which aims at lower base prices and lower promotional investment. We believe the key to the value simplicity strategy is growing like-for-like customer numbers and retaining loyal larger basket shoppers.” “Sainsbury’s shares have gone bad after its trading statement highlighted a drop in Q2 sales amid intense price competition and deflation which management expects to persist for the foreseeable future. shares are off on the (unsurprising) news of a financial regulatory (FCA) probe into its accounts after the revelation of accounting irregularities and overstated profits. WM Morrison makes it a trio of stale odours at the foot of the FTSE, based on the painful read-across from its peers and after Tuesday’s confirmation of the FCA charging its former treasurer and head of tax with insider trading. The shelves of worry continue to be stacked at the UK grocers and share prices are reflective with ugly downward trajectories. Could accounting issues be widespread? Can we trust the fat cats at the big names we shop from? Are the discounters winning? What does the future hold for the traditional ‘big shop’?”
1176	1177	Dyson accuses Samsung of vacuum cleaner 'rip-off' 	"Dyson is suing Electronics over claims that the South Korean company ""ripped off"" its vacuum cleaner technology. The British engineering company, which also pioneered ""blade"" hand dryers, has accused Samsung of copying its technology in the steering system on its latest vacuum cleaner. Dyson said Samsung's Motion Sync vacuum cleaner used technology found in two Dyson appliances, the DC37 and DC39, which have been on the market for two years. ""This looks like a cynical rip-off by the giant Korean company Samsung,"" said company founder, Sir . ""Although they are copying Dyson's patented technology, their machine is not the same. Samsung has many patent lawyers so I find it hard not to believe that this is a deliberate or utterly reckless infringement of our patent."" Samsung dismissed the claims as ""groundless"". Dyson launched proceedings in the high court at the end of August. ""We have been forced to issue proceedings in the English high court, but I would much rather invest in research to develop new technology than have to sue,"" said Dyson. Dyson has taken out a patent on ""a cleaning appliance with a steering mechanism"" and claims that its invention makes vacuum cleaners easier to manoeuvre around furniture and less likely to topple over. Samsung's that its Motion Sync design ""enables exceptionally smooth and easy movement"". A Samsung spokesperson said: ""The Samsung Motion Sync is an outcome of our own extensive research and development. ""We will take all necessary measures, including legal actions, to protect our technological innovation against Dyson's groundless claims"" Dyson holds 3,000 patents and has been fiercely protective of its technology. In 2012, it – claims that the company denied. Dyson has also taken a tough line against Chinese firms and challenged Chinese-owned Vax over the appearance of a product that Dyson felt looked similar to Dyson's DC02 cleaner. In 2011, Dyson warned the Chinese government that it (WTO) over copyright breaches including rip-offs of his inventions.  Samsung is also no stranger to the courtroom, and has been fighting a series of over smartphones and tablet computers."
1177	1178	Morrisons' sales slump by more than 7% 	" has reported a 7.1% slump in sales in the past three months, but its chief executive claimed the turnaround strategy was on track as a new price cutting campaign started. Dalton Philips said he was confident that the ""I'm cheaper"" price cuts, which permanently lowered prices by an average of 17% on 1,200 products a week ago, will draw in customers. The struggling supermarket chain, which bills itself as a value-led grocer with a focus on fresh food, even in Gateshead as part of its campaign. Total sales excluding fuel fell 4.2% in the 13 weeks to 4 May, while like-for-like sales tumbled 7.1%. This was a bigger fall than analysts had expected and compares with a decline of 5.6% over Christmas and a 2.8% drop last year. The company said its big cost savings programme was on track and did not change its £325m to £375m profit guidance for 2014. Philips set out plans in March to save £1bn over the next three years. Morrisons has been changing the layout of its stores, has invested in IT and has opened 11 local convenience stores during the quarter – with a target to have up to 200 open by the end of the year. The independent retail analyst Nick Bubb described the sales figures as ""dreadful"". He said: ""Price deflation will make the sales figures worse not better in the short run, before sales volumes pick up. Fortunately, the big cost savings programme is on track. ""Management will be under pressure to explain the thinking behind the new 'I'm cheaper' price campaign, given the scepticism expressed by Sainsbury's yesterday on how real their price cuts are."" . The industry data from Kantar Worldpanel on Wednesday showed that Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's had all lost market share in the past three months. The UK grocery market as a whole grew by 1.9%, the lowest growth for at least 11 years. Morrisons' new website Morrisons.com has launched in Warwickshire and Yorkshire, and next Monday the company will make its first deliveries in London. The aim is to reach up to half of UK households by the end of 2014 and Morrisons hopes to make more than £500m of annual sales from online and convenience stores. Philips said: ""The reaction of our customers to the 1,200 'I'm cheaper' price cuts we announced last week has been very positive. Although it will take time for their full impact to be felt, we are confident that these meaningful and permanent reductions in our prices will enable our clear points of difference to resonate strongly with consumers."""
1183	1184	Tesco cuts range by 30% to simplify shopping 	Tesco’s new boss Dave Lewis is pulling up to a third of products off its shelves as it calls time on policy that left shoppers baffled by a choice of up to 90,000 products on their weekly shop. The struggling supermarket, which has lost market share to low-cost, low-choice retailers such as Lidl and Aldi, has called in outside consultants to cut back up to 30% of its products in an attempt to cut costs and make the weekly shop simpler. Tesco stocks up to 90,000 different products – in industry jargon, stock-keeping units or SKUs. For each big brand, every pack size and flavour is a different SKU. In air fresheners alone offers 228 different options ranging from basic own-label sprays to posher varieties that come complete with propellers or disguised as stones. With tomato ketchup, Tesco offers a bewildering array of 28 sauces while in Aldi there is just one ketchup in one size. Bryan Roberts, an analyst at the market research group Kantar Retail, said the grocery industry had been guilty of self-serving innovation as big suppliers want to grow their businesses by bringing new products to market, while buyers with financial targets to hit receive cash payments for listing new products. “If you go into Tesco you will be faced with three of four bays of air fresheners,” he said. “It’s painful for the shopper to navigate.” According to Kantar Retail, the average household buys only 400 products a year, with just 41 items in their weekly shop. Lewis, Tesco’s new chief executive, announced the shake-up as part of a complete overhaul of the supermarket, which is also struggling to emerge from the shadow of last year’s accounting scandal. By stocking fewer products it will be able to cut prices, make shopping easier and improve availability on its shelves. Tesco has drafted in management consultants from the Boston Consulting Group to decide which products will have to go. They are expected to reduce the number of lines it stocks to between 65,000 and 70,000, looking at every product from aluminium foil - where Tesco offers 13 different varieties, while Aldi has two and Lidl only one - to white bread, where Tesco has 50 different loaves on its shelves to Aldi’s seven. Aldi and Lidl are described as limited-range discounters because they stock fewer than 2,000 products. That dramatically far smaller number gives them a lot of buying power and makes the business much simpler to run – meaning prices can be more competitive. “Ranges in superstores are a real point of difference versus the discounters who, with their smaller assortment, are able to drive down prices and offer a speedy shopping experience,” said Steve Dresser of the retail consultancy Grocery Insight. “A customer likes to look at one tomato ketchup and know it’s of sufficient quality, a good price, and then purchase it. This is where the discounters have gained traction and, crucially in food retail, momentum.” Wide ranges help the big grocer because they can demand payments from suppliers to put their products on their shelves. Over the past two years, as Tesco has come under increasing pressure, its range has mushroomed by a third. Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury’s, which have not expanded in the same way, stock 20,000 to 30,000 lines. Lewis has the job of leading one of the biggest turnarounds in retail after a collapse in sales that left the major UK chain barely turning a profit. This week Tesco confirmed plans to close 43 loss-making stores, putting 2,000 jobs at risk. Several thousand jobs are going as a result of Lewis closing its Cheshunt head office as he tries to cut running costs by £250m a year. Dresser said stocking fewer products is another way of saving money. “Having less items also makes it easier for staff to fill up the shelves and they are less likely to have to fill up during the day, which is expensive,” he said. “People do want choice but there has to be a happy medium. Tesco is miles ahead of the pack [in terms of SKUs].” But slashing the ranges could leave Tesco with a new problem – too much shelf space. Its biggest stores are already a drag on the business as shoppers have switched to doing more frequent shops at smaller local shops. According to the industry bible the Grocer, the unwanted products will be swept off the shelves in one go, possibly at the end of summer, giving Tesco stores a dramatic new look. It could also cause big problems for smaller suppliers with specialist products. A spokesperson for Tesco said: “The review is ongoing and no changes have yet been set.” Tesco 224 options, from Tesco gel air freshener to Glade sense & spray relaxing zen. Aldi 12 options, all own brand Tesco 98 options, from Tilda steamed wholegrain basmati to Yutaka sushi rice. Aldi six options, all own brand. Tesco 28 options, from own brand to GranoVita organic tomato ketchup. Aldi one option, own brand. Tesco 60 options, including Coca-Cola Life, Zero and Citrus Zest. Aldi four options: Diet Coke and Coca-Cola, in 12-can packs or 4x1.5l bottles. Tesco 283 options, from Nescafe to Taylors of Harrogate lazy Sunday coffee beans. Aldi 20 options, 5xNescafe and 15x own brand. Tesco 26 options, from Tesco everyday value dishwasher tablets to Finish quantum powerball tablets in apple and lime. Aldi three options, own brand in different pack sizes.
1184	1185	Kraft censured over broken promise to keep Cadbury factory open 	"US food conglomerate Kraft has been censured by the body that polices City takeovers for breaking the promise it made during the five-month battle to buy to keep its Somerdale factory in Somerset open. The decision by the Takeover Panel to issue its first public reprimand for three years also sparked the resignation of its new director general, Peter Kiernan, who had advised on its £11.6bn hostile takeover of Cadbury. Kiernan was the main adviser at Lazard in London, the investment bank representing Kraft in the City. While the bank did not receive the same public censure as its client, it is understood to have received a private one behind the scenes after the panel ruled Lazard had ""failed to discharge fully its responsibilities"" in ensuring information released by Kraft was verifiable. A senior and highly regarded banker is appointed as director general of the Takeover Panel every two years and acts as a poacher-turned-gamekeeper to monitor bankers' and companies' adherence to the rules designed to protect shareholders from being misled by companies during takeovers. The Takeover Panel's ruling was based on Kraft's promise in official stock market announcements that the UK would be a ""net beneficiary in terms of jobs"" and its statement that, if it took over Cadbury, it would be ""in a position to continue to operate the Somerdale factory … and invest in Bournville"". The bid succeeded on 2 February but Kraft subsequently said a week later that it could not keep Somerdale open because Cadbury had already spent more than £100m in transferring production from it to Poland. The panel concluded that while it accepted Kraft had an ""honest and genuine belief"" that it could keep Somerdale open, it concluded the company should have sought more detailed information from Cadbury. Kraft, which first announced its intention to bid for Cadbury in September last year, when it made its first claims about Somerdale, could have taken ""mitigating action"" to reverse its statement after meeting Cadbury's management on 18 and 19 January, the panel said. However, Kraft, even though it was warned by Cadbury management that the plans to close Somerdale were well advanced, did not ask for further information and proceeded with its ""belief"" that it could keep Somerdale open. It is thought that Kraft had hoped the panel, rather than launching the high-profile censure, would instead issue general guidance to the stock market spelling out how companies should distinguish between their belief of being able to achieve something and their actual ability to do so. Kraft refused to apologise even though it had been forced into when Marc Firestone, the company's executive president, used the word ""sorry"" three times. The MPs on the committee later lamented what they called the ""woeful handling"" of the closure of the Somerdale plant and said that the company had acted both ""irresponsibly and unwisely"". TodayFirestone preferred to use the term ""regret"". He added: ""We have decided to accept publication of the panel's decision rather than proceed to an administrative appeal. We believe it's best for everyone to put this matter behind us so we can focus our energy on doing what's most important now. ""We regret that, once we had full information, it was not feasible to keep Somerdale open, as we'd originally believed possible. Even though we never made a promise or a commitment to keep the facility open, we recognise that our statement of belief created uncertainty among Somerdale employees,"" Firestone added. In accepting the panel's decision, Kraft said it now wanted to work with others to try to redevelop the Somerdale site, where the closure threatens 400 jobs. Kiernan had been due to take up his appointment as director general on 1 March but this was delayed by the ongoing Kraft takeover, during which Robert Hingley, who had been appointed director general of the panel in December 2007, agreed to stay on. While a new director general is sought, Philip Remnant will return to the role he first held between 2001 and 2003. The panel said: ""Peter Kiernan has ... decided to withdraw his candidacy for the role of director general following the resolution of the panel's investigation into [the deal]"". The last public rebuke issued by the panel was in November 2007, when Australian hedge fund manager Monterrey Investment Management was censured for failing to disclose share trades on time."
1191	1192	Dyson seeks to block copycat manufacturers in China 	"The billionaire inventor Sir James Dyson has warned that it risks being expelled from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over copyright breaches including rip-offs of his famed inventions. Dyson, a member of the prime minister's business advisory group, issued the warning as executives at the company he founded prepare to raise their concerns this week at an and attended by Baroness Wilcox, minister for IP. The firm said Wilcox was ""aware"" of its concerns. The inventor of the eponymous vacuum cleaner and blade hand dryer said: China's reputation among foreign investors is being diminished by the flouting of product copyrights and a two-speed patent system that appears to discriminate against non-Chinese applications. ""They are running the risk of being expelled from the WTO. They are creating an unlevel playing field by taking our technology and selling it all over the world."" China joined the , the body that enforces global trade rules, in 2001. Dyson argues that China benefits from strictly monitored IP regimes outside its own border, but has failed to crack down on domestic offenders as it pursues rapid economic growth. The inventor cited a recent case in China where his company successfully sued a firm manufacturing a copy of its bladeless electronic fan. ""We had to put a private detective in their factory and take photos of them making the fans. Then we won the case and they were fined $7,500 but they didn't pay the fine and they just carried on,"" he said. Dyson is pursuing 20 design or patent cases around the world, many of them related to the distribution and sale of products made in China. The inventor did not put a figure on the amount of lost revenue but said the total was ""quite a lot"". The business has spent $3m (£1.9m) on legal fees. Dyson claims the disadvantage was driven home by discrepancies in the bureaucratic process of applying for patents. Dyson said Chinese applications take less than a year, while it can take five years for a foreign business. ""Under WTO regulations, each country is supposed to treat foreign patent applications with the same speed as local applications. But they are passing Chinese application in months and taking five years for ours."" He added: ""If we have someone copying our products in China we cannot sue them until our patent is passed. This has not created a level playing field."" Alongside his day job, Dyson has emerged as one of the most passionate advocates for political backing for design and manufacturing in the UK. Last month he urged technology and manufacturing companies to give more senior executive positions to engineers, reflecting their status in the academic world, as he . Ironically, one of the countries that regularly awards senior political positions to engineers is China.

1207	1208	Labour MP refuses to apologise for calling Pfizer 'rapists' 	"The Labour MP Austin Mitchell has refused to apologise for likening the US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to ""rapists"" over its controversial takeover of . Mitchell sparked outrage with a post on Twitter criticising David Cameron for refusing to block the proposed takeover. He : ""Cameron dare not stop Pfizer because he dare not offend the US in any way. Roll up rapists."" The remark prompted the Tory MP Nicky Morgan, the minister for women, to call on Ed Miliband to suspend the veteran MP for Great Grimsby from the party. Mitchell, an MP since 1977, : ""Naughty me. Substute [sic] rapaciousness before any more Physer [sic] defenders weigh in."" Speaking to the Guardian, Mitchell said he ""should have used the word rapaciousness"" instead of ""rapists"" but declined to apologise. ""If it needs explanation, I should have used the word rapaciousness,"" he said. ""If I said we should not allow the company [AstraZeneca] to be taken over, people fired, research jettisoned, I would have gone over the 140 characters that Twitter allows. He added: ""It's difficult to use in one small word the disembodying of a company, the jettisoning of its research. I don't know what you would call that. Perhaps I should have done a more detailed comment."" However, he said it was ""crazy"" that politicians were calling for him to be dismissed. Mitchell said: ""I'm not going to apologise, don't be silly. What about people who talk about the rape of the countryside – do they have to apologise?"" Morgan, the Loughborough MP , wrote to Miliband to urge him to discipline Mitchell. She wrote: ""People across the whole country will be appalled that anybody would try to link a proposed corporate takeover with the horrific crime of rape. I am sure you will agree with me that such a comparison is deeply offensive as it trivialises sex attacks and the horrific and traumatising effects such attacks can have on victims. ""I am clear that these comments are totally unacceptable and that Austin Mitchell must withdraw what he has written immediately and issue a full, unreserved apology. ""As the leader of the Labour party I look forward to hearing what action you intend to take in response to this totally unacceptable behaviour."" On Twitter, the Tory whip Claire Perry joined the outcry, . ""A disgraceful mistake as is the deafening silence from Labour,"" she wrote. Another Tory whip, Harriet Baldwin, also weighed in with a call for his suspension. ""Thoroughly offensive tweet about rapists and USA,"" she wrote.

1208	1209	David Cameron 'not convinced' over assisted dying bill 	" has said he is worried about moves to legalise euthanasia although he would be happy for the Commons to debate the issue of assisted dying. Speaking ahead of a controversial debate on the issue in the House of Lords, the prime minister said he was ""not convinced that further steps need to be taken"" by parliament. The issue was raised by Sir Richard Ottaway during prime minister's questions ahead of the second reading of Lord Falconer's assisted dying bill, which would allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally ill patients judged to have less than six months to live. ""In the recent case of [locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony] Nicklinson on the question of assisted dying, Lord Neuberger, the president of the supreme court, said that parliament now had the opportunity to consider reform of the law in the knowledge that if parliament doesn't act, the courts may. This could raise serious constitutional issues,"" Ottoway said. ""Does he agree that whatever your views on the subject, the other place is to be commended for having a debate, but what the public really want is a debate in this House?"" Cameron also suggested William Hague, the new leader of the House of Commons, would think about allowing MPs to talk about the issue. ""I am very happy for a debate to be held here and of course there are now opportunities for backbenchers to hold debates in the chamber and I am sure the new leader of the House of Commons who I am sure we all want to welcome to his place, will be listening carefully to that request,"" he said. ""For myself I am not convinced that further steps need to be taken, I worry about legalising euthanasia and people might be being pushed into things that they don't actually want for themselves, but by all means let's have the debate."" Former archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey has said he changed his mind on the issue of assisted dying after considering cases like that of Tony Nicklinson and ""the reality of needless suffering"". However, the church is officially opposed to assisted dying and Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has spoken strongly against it. On Tuesday, leading doctors called for terminally ill patients who are suffering ""unendurably"" to be able to end their lives with doctors' help, in an 11th-hour attempt to persuade the Lords to back such plans.

1214	1215	John Lewis enjoys record Christmas with 7% sales rise 	" is likely to have beaten the market for the fifth Christmas in a row, having recorded a 7% rise in like-for-like sales in the five weeks to 28 December. While most retailers will not disclose their festive performance until next week, John Lewis has revealed a surge in sales of electrical goods, beauty products and clothing in November and December in which the department store group is likely to have taken market share from rivals. Total sales for the five weeks to 28 December reached £734m. John Lewis was boosted by a 22.6% rise in online sales compared with the same period in 2012, accounting for almost a third of its total sales over the period. But sales in stores were also up, by 1.2%, as shoppers snapped up last-minute presents on the high street and were tempted to buy additional items when they went to stores to pick up goods ordered online. At least a third of shoppers coming into stores to ""click and collect"" bought something else while they were there. ""Growth was well spread,"" said Andy Street, the managing director of John Lewis. ""It's because of how we've got bricks and clicks to work hand in glove."" He said the retailer had an ""absolute corker"" online earlier in the season and that the shops had done well close to Christmas and at the clearance sale on 27 December. That day was a new record sales day for John Lewis stores, with the business as a whole taking £35.6m. Street said: ""This Christmas has seen trade take a different shape to previous years, with an early peak driven by Black Friday and a huge surge in the final 10 days."" He said he recognised there was a danger that the success of Black Friday – the US tradition of a discount day on the first weekend in December – would increasingly set the tone for a Christmas trading period dominated by deals and promotions. But he added that John Lewis had not experienced that problem this year. ""It's about the business being absolutely clear about when we are discounting and when we are not,"" Street said. John Lewis did run discounts ahead of Christmas because its commitment to be ""never knowingly undersold"" forces it to match deals offered by rivals. But Street said the retailer did not discount its own-label ranges before 27 December and that strategy paid off in a strong start to its post-Christmas clearance sale. ""It was the definitely the right move to hold off on discounting our own product until after Christmas and the market showed it was strong enough to bear it,"" he said. John Lewis's success with that tactic bodes well for Next, the fashion and homewares retailer that was among the handful of high street firms that avoided discounting ahead of Boxing Day. Next will reveal its Christmas trading performance on Friday kicking off a flurry of statements from listed retailers over the next few weeks. Both John Lewis and Next's strategies differed markedly from Debenhams, which was forced to warn on profits earlier this week when its chief executive, Michael Sharp, described the high street as having been a ""sea of red"" in the runup to Christmas, with clothing chains attempting to clear unwanted stock. While Debenhams reported virtually flat sales and falling margins, Street said margins had held up at John Lewis and that fashion and beauty sales rose 8.5%. Growth in sales of jewellery, accessories and menswear helped to compensate for what he admitted was a tough season for clothing. Performance elsewhere in John Lewis gives a clue to how the rest of the high street might fare. Electricals and home technology sales at John Lewis rose 10.7%, with the strongest growth coming from kitchen gadgets such as coffee machines, toasters and kettles, as well as from vacuum cleaners. Their sales growth outstripped iPads, despite one of the Apple tablets being sold every 10 seconds in the week before Christmas. But the total value of hi-tech sales was greater. Another positive sign came in home furnishings, where sales rose 2%, which Street said was owing to a pick-up in the housing market. Like-for-like sales is a comparative measure that ignores the effect of new store space and other changes in activities."
1216	1217	Downing Street admits new women's minister is subordinate to a man 	" has been accused of having a ""blind spot on women"" after Downing Street was forced to admit that Nicky Morgan would become the first women's minister in recent years to be subordinate to a man. Downing Street split the equalities and women's ministerial posts – handing the first to the new culture secretary, Sajid Javid, – because Morgan voted against the legalisation of gay marriage. Morgan, the new financial secretary to the Treasury, will attend cabinet as the women's minister. But Downing Street admitted that women's issues fit within the ""over-arching"" equalities portfolio, which will be run by Javid in the culture department. It will be the first time since the creation of a cabinet level women's minister in 1997, a post occupied by Harriet Harman, that a women has been answerable to a man. A Labour spokesman said: ""David Cameron's blind spot on women has been exposed. There are now just three women running government departments out of a possible total of 22. ""There is now no full member of the cabinet speaking for women. What is clear is that they are now in a mess about who speaks for women in the cabinet. It seems clear there is no full cabinet member speaking for women. This is clearly an unsustainable and unacceptable position."" Labour criticised the government after Downing Street admitted that Javid would be in overall charge of the equalities portfolio. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""The secretary of state for culture remains the secretary of state for culture media, sport and equalities. So there has been no change. He has over arching responsibility for the entire equalities portfolio. Within that portfolio there is now a separate minister for women."" Asked whether Morgan would be subordinate to Javid, the spokesman said: ""He is the cabinet minister. She attends cabinet."" Morgan will be given a desk in the culture department. Downing Street insisted it was ""beefing up"" its focus on equalities as there will now be four ministers responsible – Javid, Morgan, Jenny Willott and Helen Grant. ""There is now going to be a standalone minister for women who will attend cabinet. The reason why we have done that is because it is an important agenda."" Morgan defended her decision to vote against gay marriage last year on the grounds that ""marriage is between a man and a woman"". Downing Street said that Morgan had been free to follow her conscience in the free vote."

1220	1221	Moss Bros 12.9% sales surge brings bumper share dividend 	" has unveiled surging sales over Christmas and will pay a bumper dividend to shareholders as a result of its increased cash generation. Sales at stores open a year or more rose 12.9% in the five weeks to 11 January, accelerating from a rate of 7.3% for the 24 weeks to the same date. The formal wear clothing specialist said its improving sales over Christmas meant annual profit was set to beat market forecasts. Moss Bros said its rapid cash generation meant it could afford to reduce the net cash on its balance sheet from £28m to £15m. It will recommend a final dividend of 4.7p a share, up from 0.9p a year earlier, taking the total payout for the financial year to 5p. The company's shares jumped 22% to a 52-week high of 91p as investors bought in to receive the dividend. Chief executive Brian Brick said: ""We are encouraged by trading over the key Christmas trading period. The improved sales performance, continued strong cost management and rigorous clearance of stock mean that we will finish 2013/14 ahead of market expectations. An ongoing focus on cash management has allowed us to announce an accelerated and progressive dividend policy."" Moss Bros's strong performance marks a turnaround in fortunes for the 163-year-old company, which paid no dividend for five years until a year ago. Many thought there was no future for the business when Brick took over in 2009 but he has , improved its online service to let customers pick up goods instore and sold unwanted businesses such as the Hugo Boss store franchise. Cantor Fitzgerald retail analyst Freddie George said: ""The major attraction of the company is the potential for the development of the retail online platform."" After this financial year, which ends on 25 January, the dividend will increase ""progressively"" as the business continues to generate cash, Moss Bros said."
1222	1223	Carpetright issues another profit warning as sales slump 	"Carpetright has issued , after failing to generate any improvement in its fortunes from the reviving UK housing market. The UK's largest floor-covering retailer also said it had been hit by ""extremely difficult economic conditions"" in the Netherlands, where it has 15% of its 620 stores. Pre-tax profit for the year ending 26 April is expected to be £3.5m-£5.5m, the company said on Wednesday in a trading statement – well below analysts' forecasts of £7.8m. shares were down by more than 5% to 556p on Wednesday, a small recovery after an 8% fall on market opening. In the UK, like-for-like sales were flat in the eight weeks to 22 March, despite an upturn in the housing market and floods that devastated a swath of the country. Sales in the company's stores in the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland were down 5.3% on last year. Lord Harris, the founder and executive chairman of Carpetright, who returned to a full-time role in 2013, said: ""Based on previous experience we had expected to see some recovery as UK housing transaction volumes improved. In the event, this has yet to materialise and the momentum established in the third quarter was not sustained. ""With the important Easter trading period still to come, we are continuing to concentrate on a range of self-help measures as we seek to improve the group's performance."" Carpetright's performance looks even more threadbare set against that of Topps Tiles, which on Tuesday reported a 12% increase in revenues in the 26 weeks to the end of March. The UK's largest tile retailer said it was on course to increase half-year pre-tax profits to £8m from its 313 stores, compared to £4.7m the previous year. Sanjay Vidyarthi, head retail analyst at Liberum, said Carpetright's problems lay in its business rather than the wider economy. ""Carpetright probably has too much space in the UK relative to the size of the market and some of its stores are expensive. My sense is that they have lost market share,"" he said, although he added that a lack of data meant it was ""difficult to quantify the strength of the competition"". Disappointing sales are only the latest setback for Carpetright, which along with four other flooring and furniture retailers on misleading promotions. Nick Worthington, the former boss of the bed retailer Dreams, has been drafted in to take charge of Carpetright's European business, as the company continues to shake up its management team. Last October, after only 18 months in the job. Harris stepped into the job of full-time chairman, having led the company since founding it in 1988."
1224	1225	Support for Tories falls three points after post-budget bounce 	"The budget has failed to boost the with voters, according to a new Guardian/ICM poll, as the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, says Labour will continue to talk about the cost of living because people are likely to be worse off at the next election than in 2010. The Tories have dropped three points to 32% over the month since March despite the positive media reaction to George Osborne's ""budget for savers"". The chancellor and David Cameron continue to perform well with voters when they are asked who is best to run the economy. And figures to be released on Tuesday are expected to show that British workers have enjoyed the first rise in their real pay for four years, with wage increases finally overtaking inflation. But in an article in the Guardian, Balls claims voters will not accept the idea that they are better off under Cameron. He says , which remains ahead on 37%, down one point from last month, will keep talking about the cost of living regardless of a ""handful of statistics"" pointing to improved economic conditions. Balls argues that a central issue of the next election will be Ronald Reagan's famous question: ""Are you better off than you were four years ago?"" Balls will say that the answer to this ""looks likely to be a resounding no"", adding that it is ""no wonder David Cameron and George Osborne are desperate for Labour to stop talking about this issue"". Bracing for Tory claims that the squeeze on household budgets is coming to an end, and after the latest data from the jobs market confirming the strength of the recovery, Balls says: ""Over the coming weeks, we can expect ministers to start telling us that the cost of living crisis is over. Will people buy it? I don't think so. Because for most families in Britain today, such a declaration, on the back of a handful of economic statistics, will only confirm just how out of touch this government is."" Coming days after the resignation of the culture secretary, Maria Miller, in a row about overclaimed expenses, the Tories' standing in the long-running ICM series has been worse only once since last summer. But in the Guardian/ICM poll, the Tories' team is most trusted on economic management, with Cameron and Osborne now beating Ed Miliband and Ed Balls on this score by 40% to 22%, a decisive margin. That is the biggest economic lead for the Conservative duo in more than two years, and the second worst score for Miliband/Balls to date, on a question that ICM has asked regularly since 2010. The conventional wisdom at Westminster has long been that the economy will be crucial to the overall outcome of the 2015 election. But after the passing of an immediate budget bounce, which briefly registered in surveys by other pollsters, the Conservative party may start to worry about a vote-free recovery. The , after the Nigel Farage v Nick Clegg TV debates, have stagnated on 12%, while Ukip has bounced up two points to 11%. Speaking on Monday, Clegg insisted that he wants to lead the Lib Dems until at least 2020 as he brushed off the bad set of opinion polls and predictions of a wipeout at next month's . The small print of the latest ICM poll confirms that many voters who prefer the Cameron/Osborne financial stewardship nonetheless decline to back their party. That is particularly true among supporters of Ukip, which has drained substantial support from the Tories since 2010, and continued to do so this month. Its supporters now trust the Tories more than Labour on the economy by an overwhelming 54% to 5% margin, yet continue to signal that they will vote for Farage over Cameron in a general election. The Tories may hope to bring many such voters back to the fold by May 2015, but the more immediate challenge is next month's European parliamentary elections. ICM also asked about voting intentions in the European elections, for the first time since February. It found that the net effect of a seesawing couple of months showed stability in the support for Labour (up one point to 36%), the Conservatives (unchanged on 25%) and Ukip (unchanged on 20%). But the Lib Dems were down three points to just 6%. Balls says Labour is planning to set out ""radical but credible"" policies aimed at tackling the ""deep-seated cost-of-living crisis"" over the coming months. Measures will include strengthening the minimum wage, ending the abuse of zero-hours contracts, expanding free childcare for working parents, and devolving economic power to Britain's towns and cities. Balls makes it clear that Labour will stick to its cost-of-living argument even though statistics are likely to show that inflation has ticked down to 1.6% in March from 1.7% in February. At the same time, annual wage growth is thought to have been 1.8% in the three months to February. If confirmed, those rates will mark the first rise in real pay since April 2010, a month before the coalition came to power. Pay growth has not been consistently above inflation since 2008. ""This week's data releases should confirm that wages are now rising faster than prices of goods and services,"" said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank in London. ""Previously, price increases were outpacing pay growth, meaning that households could afford to buy less and less with their pay cheques. The situation is now reversing and household purchasing power is on an improving trend."" With the general election just over a year away, Labour has sought to focus attention on how strongly inflation has outstripped pay growth, adding to the burden on households from the coalition's austerity drive. Inflation figures due to be published today are expected to show the pressure easing. A supermarket food price war and lower petrol price inflation are expected to have brought the headline consumer price index measure of inflation down for the sixth month running in March. The retail prices index measure is forecast to have fallen to 2.5% in March from 2.7% in February, according to a Reuters poll. ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults aged 18+ by telephone on 11-13 April 2014. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules."
1228	1229	Mothercare shares up 18% after retailer reports signs of recovery 	"Shares in soared nearly 18% after the maternity and childrenswear specialist revealed a 61% jump in underlying profits and confirmed it had agreed new terms with its bankers. The retailer said on Thursday trading had improved in the fourth quarter of its financial year as it closed lossmaking stores and made its maternity clothing more fashionable. Sales for the year to 29 March rose 0.5% as a 6.4% rise in international sales to £729.2m helped offset a 7.5% slump in UK sales. Underlying pre-tax profits rose to £9.5m despite a £21.5m loss in the UK. There was relief as the retailer confirmed that it had persuaded its bankers to give it more breathing space to complete its turnaround plan with improved terms and a £10m increase in its loan facility. The company said it had ended the year with debts of £46.5m as it controlled stocks tightly. Shares in Mothercare have slumped by more than 50% in the past year as the company endured a dismal Christmas and the resignation of its chief executive, Simon Calver, after a damaging profit warning. Alan Parker, the chairman of Mothercare, admitted there was a lot more to do despite the improvement in trading performance. But he added: ""We are determined to achieve our goal of returning the UK to profitability, growing our international business and building shareholder value over the long term."" Analysts said Mothercare remained in tricky terrain with no certainty that the interim chief executive, Mark Newton-Jones, would stay on, while the company continues to suffer from expensive UK stores and poor exchange rates on its overseas earnings. ""In our view, any management recovery plan might require more capital and higher lease provisions on an already weak balance sheet,"" said Mike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor."
1229	1230	Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby linked to Malta tax haven 	"David Cameron's election strategist owns and runs an offshore company in Malta, it has been claimed. The link between and the tax haven could make uncomfortable reading for the prime minister, who has described legal ploys to avoid tax as morally wrong. The that Crosby's Maltese firm, Rutland Ltd, was run from the offices of a trust firm specialising in ""wealth preservation"". A spokesman for Crosby's UK firm, CTF Partners, confirmed that Crosby, an Australian who lives in the UK, was a non-domicile – ""non-dom"" – but insisted he paid his ""full tax obligations"". After disclosures about the comedian Jimmy Carr using a legal scheme to avoid tax, Cameron said last year: ""Some of these schemes we have seen are quite frankly morally wrong. ""It is not fair on hardworking people who do the right thing and pay their taxes to see these sorts of scams."" CTF is reportedly being paid £200,000 a year for working one day a week on plans to get the Tories elected in 2015. The firm, which Crosby runs with fellow Australian Mark Textor and British director Mark Fullbrook, has offices in London, Sydney and Milan. All three men are also shareholders in Rutland, set up in Malta in 2011 to provide ""consultancy and technical services"". The Mirror said there was no suggestion that Crosby or Rutland had broken the law. Tax campaigners have questioned whether it was right for Cameron and the Tories to employ someone involved in a company based in a tax haven. Crosby has been credited with sharpening the Tories' message and his interventions have been particularly welcomed by those on the right of the party. he told 180 of the party's MPs that the key to success in the 2015 general election was to get its immigration message right. A spokesman for CTF said Crosby paid tax in the UK on all his UK earnings at exactlythe same rate as any UK citizen. ""It is categorically wrong and seriously damaging to claim Rutland is 'hiding the true identity of the company owners' as this has been a matter of public record for years. ""Rutland is a legitimate company, which fulfils all its tax obligations in Malta. It has never done any business in the UK or paid any dividends to anyone in the UK. ""It has not received fees from any UK company, body, or individual. Any claim, or attempt to claim, that it was set up, or is used, to avoid paying UK tax is categorically wrong and highly damaging."" A spokesman for the Conservative party referred queries to CTF Partners."
1238	1239	The Lynton Crosby effect: dog whistles and jewellery jokes 	"onservative MPs who packed into the main conference hall at Heythrop Park in Oxfordshire at their awayday this month learned an important lesson about their Australian campaign director: is not one for deference. With most of the cabinet dotted randomly in seats around the hall, Crosby decided to liven up a slide presentation on election tactics by recounting a story about the prime minister's affluent Witney seat nearby. He told his audience of about 200 MPs that he had been startled by the expensive jewellery on display when the prime minister invited him to be the main speaker at a fundraising dinner. ""If just one of the ladies had managed to sell one earring we could have funded the Tory party for three months,"" Crosby said to howls of laughter, according to a member of the audience. The mildly subversive vignette, which plays to the cliche that the prime minister is part of a gilded circle far removed from the lives even of his own MPs, was a telling illustration of the greatest asset that Crosby brings to the party. ""Lynton is extremely good at talking truth unto power,"" says a veteran. The central role afforded to Crosby at the Tory awayday – and his ability to tell a joke at the prime minister's expense in his presence – shows that he retains the complete confidence of Downing Street, despite months of critical publicity. The Tory leadership knew that Crosby, a hate figure on the left in Australia after he helped the centre-right Liberal leader John Howard to four successive election victories with highly divisive tactics, would attract adverse attention. But they were slightly taken aback by months of relentless campaigning by Labour over allegations that Crosby, whose company advises the giant tobacco firm Philip Morris, had persuaded Cameron to abandon plans for plain cigarette packaging. Crosby insists he has never lobbied the prime minister. Crosby went even further and said he had not discussed tobacco policy with Cameron or lobbied the prime minister on the issue. Cameron still believes that he made the right decision when, encouraged by Crosby's great fan George Osborne, he finally persuaded the Australian to run the Tory campaign for the 2015 general election when the party was at one of its lows last year. The prime minister had one key thought: the notoriously undisciplined Tory tribe needed a disciplinarian who would command respect in a way that appears to be beyond the leadership. One senior MP says: ""As far as most of the parliamentary party is concerned, Lynton Crosby really is the Wizard of Oz. Old lags see him as a real professional. In a first world war analogy we have had the bright young staff officers but we now have a battle-hardened commander as our chief of staff."" Osborne had another thought, which even Cameron's closest friends voice with care in his presence: how to avoid a repeat of the ramshackle 2010 general election campaign, when the Tories had a string of competing messages. One Tory who knows Crosby well from the 2005 Tory general election campaign, which he ran after a late summons from Michael Howard, says he will bring three strong qualities. These are: clarity; an ability to stand up to Osborne and Cameron; and an ability to run a good team. The Tory said: ""The ability to tell David and George when they are wrong was probably the most important quality recommending Lynton. He will be able to stand up to them. Nobody can do that apart from the two of them and Steve [Hilton]."" Crosby famously ran a tight – but happy – ship in the old Tory HQ on Victoria Street during the 2005 general election. He made singled out Colin on the front desk for praise, made department heads play computer games against each other and ran a national anthem singing contest when the Tories were criticised for tilting to the right on immigration. Wales won. The party gained only 33 seats and saw its overall vote increased by just 0.7 points to 32.4%. But Tories believe Crosby helped save them from an even worse result because Howard had only been in place for 18 months after the disastrous tenure of Iain Duncan Smith. Senior figures from then remember his disciplined message, which saw the Tories campaign on five policy areas explained in 10 words: more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, school discipline, controlled immigration. Crosby says the party should remember a key lesson from 2005: choose an issue if it meets two conditions. These are that is ""salient"" and resonates with the electorate, and the party naturally identifies with the issue. In the runup to 2015 Crosby believes the Tories should focus on four issues: the economy, welfare, the strength of the prime minister (and weakness of Ed Miliband), and immigration. He calls this scraping ""the barnacles off the boat"" and is said to believe that health should not be a signature issue for the the party – it is salient but not one where Tories can expect to have a large impact. Tory MPs were also given a blunt message by Crosby at their awayday on the challenge of Nigel Farage's UK Independence party. ""Stop worrying about Ukip – play the policies, not the people,"" one MP quoted him as saying. ""A lot of Ukip supporters will come back."" Extensive – and highly expensive – polling is used to identify the ""salient"" issues, how voters feel about them and which messages resonate. One Crosby fan, who says he has an instinctive feel for ordinary voters, says: ""Lynton's forensic polling makes the UK polling industry look like a Skoda – no, not even Skoda. It makes it look like a Trabant."" Cameron, who first got to know Crosby during the 2005 campaign, when he was asked by Howard to take charge of the manifesto, believes this discipline has already started paying dividends, with a much sharper Tory operation in the early summer. The prime minister was also struck by Crosby's success in helping Boris Johnson secure two successive election victories in 2008 and 2012. One ally says: ""It is like the film The Dresser where you have the prima donna and you have the guy who's got to get him on stage. Lynton took charge of Boris on a couple of occasions in no uncertain terms and Boris listened to him. You can see Lynton has done that in the last few months for us nationally.""But Crosby's successful role in the second London mayoral campaign in 2012 highlighted weaknesses that have given some Tories pause for thought. Guto Harri, a former senior aide to the mayor, said Crosby's effective but dull campaign, which focused on Tory voters in outer London, took the ""bubbles out of the champagne"". Critics say Crosby's tactics exemplify ""dog-whistle"" politics – in which messages, crafted in inoffensive language, are targeted at the right. One Tory said: ""There is only one type of politics Lynton Crosby understands, which is the core vote thing … He gets the vote out by really going for the lowest common denominator."" There were concerns that Crosby appeared to show little interest in reaching out to black and minority ethnic voters. There were criticisms that Munira Mirza, now deputy mayor for education and culture, and Kulveer Ranger, now the mayor's director of environment, did not have more prominent roles in the campaign. ""It was moronic,"" one Tory said. The Mail on Sunday reported last year that Crosby said the Johnson campaign should not focus much attention on ""fucking Muslims"". But even his Tory critics say Crosby is not in the slightest bit racist. Crosby's spokesman repeated his response to the allegations at the time: ""It is entirely mischievous to suggest Lynton is racist in any way. He campaigned vigorously for the Muslim vote during the mayoral race. He has absolutely no recollection whatsoever of making these comments."" The six-figure costs of Crosby's work – his consultancy fee is supplemented by fees for polling carried out by his CTF consultancy – raised eyebrows at Tory HQ, where there are concerns that one person acts as pollster and strategist. One veteran, who is dismissive of claims that the pollster Andrew Cooper of Populus will still have a role, says: ""Polling and strategy are two separate disciplines. Polling is objective. It is telling you where the battlefield is. If the leader says to the pollster give me the first move you recommend, you have now moved him from objectivity to subjectivity. The two disciplines should be very separate because you need a check and a balance."" Some Tory critics say Crosby is little more than a hired gun who has actually worked against the . In the 2009 European elections he worked as campaign manager for the small but well-funded party Libertas, which secured 0.5%. ""You are relying on one man who is a commercial hired gun,"" one Tory said. The return of Crosby means that Cameron's former policy guru Steve Hilton, who had moved to California, is likely to play an even smaller role than the already diminished one he was planning. Hilton believes Crosby is a brilliant campaign organiser but the wrong man to take charge of messaging. But there will therefore be no repeat of the clashes during the last election between ""Steve the husky"" and Andy Coulson, the harder Tory. One senior figure says: ""That Coulson role has been filled by Lynton who is a much bigger beast than Coulson was. There is always a tension at the top and now the balance of power has shifted quite dramatically against Steve. Steve used to be counterbalanced by Coulson. He is now outweighed by Lynton."" Crosby may be a weighty figure but even his Tory critics admit that he has never taken on airs and graces. At the party's away day he made a point of going up to the outspoken Tory MP Sarah Wollaston after she was booed by her colleagues when she confronted Crosby in a question and answer session. ""Lynton is a pretention-free guy,"" one friend said, recalling that Crosby modestly hung at the back of the room at the Australian high commission during a reception for the Queen. ""We don't do that sort of stuff,"" he said, much to the irritation of his monarchist wife, Dawn, when asked why he had not elbowed to the front. So when Tories gather for brainstorming sessions at manor houses in the runup to the election, they know that a blunt Australian will help keep them grounded."
1250	1251	Warsi resignation: an astonishing charge sheet against No 10 over Gaza 	"ayeeda Warsi's resignation may yet prove to be a passing summer storm. But the vitriolic tone of her attack on David Cameron's policy towards Gaza, and her status as the first Muslim cabinet member, suggests her departure has the potential to inflict both political and moral damage on the months before the general election. More importantly, she may have opened the possibility that longstanding, unequivocal British political support for any Israeli government is now under question. After all, it is not often a minister leaves government warning that its actions, or silence, are morally indefensible, not in the national interest, liable to foster terrorism in the UK and likely to undermine British influence in the Middle East by failing to be seen to be fair-minded. There was a raw emotional power to her resignation as she set out her anguished reaction to the collapse of hospitals, the death of young children on beaches and the realisation that children the same age as those in her own family were being killed in the Israeli raids. Few ministers have quit accusing of failing to speak out against the flattening of schools and hospitals, or recounting tales of backbenchers in tears at the refusal of David Cameron to condemn Israel. But her resignation is not just an emotional response. Her criticisms of the style of the government, and the claim that this unease has spread to senior civil servants and ministers in the Foreign Office, has the potential to widen the dispute into a more generalised debate about Cameron's way of governing. She is bound to be asked whether her concern expressed in her resignation letter about the way in which foreign policy decisions are being made is a criticism of the new foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, or the way in which No 10 has set the parameters for Foreign Office policy over the Middle East. Her resignation letter also makes clear that she regards the departures of Kenneth Clarke and the former attorney general Dominic Grieve in the recent reshuffle as not incidental, but symbolic of a new and more casual approach to international jurisprudence. In her former role as Foreign Office minister she had been responsible for upholding British commitments to international law at the UN and elsewhere. Collectively, this is an astonishing charge sheet, and the gulf between her position and that of Cameron sits oddly alongside claims by George Osborne that her resignation was ""frankly an unnecessary decision"". The chancellor's dismissal of the differences between her position and that of the government is at odds with the verdict of other senior Tories. Alistair Burt, the recently sacked Foreign Office minister responsible for the Middle East, said Lady Warsi's departure was a huge loss, and Nicholas Soames, a senior figure on the 1922 committee, urged Cameron to take note. , never slow to gauge the Tory or public mood, criticised Israel in the sharpest terms within minutes of the peer's resignation. Warsi may be deeply disliked by some senior Tories who see her as vain, unprincipled, self-centred and motivated by animus at her demotion from the party chairmanship in 2012. There may have been a misjudgment in ever promoting her, and then preventing her from saying much of consequence about her role as faith and communities minister in the UK. Those Tories currently briefing against her would be wise to remember her symbolic status. Many Labour cabinet members were exasperated by Clare Short's criticisms of Labour's Iraq policy in 2003, but her resignation made her popular with a certain constituency. In the end the dispute over the Middle East, and Blair's refusal to publicly demand that accept a ceasefire in Lebanon in the summer of 2006, sowed the seeds for the effective coup against him by supporters of Gordon Brown On the issue of , Cameron's leadership is not at the slightest risk, but he is exposed on a foreign policy issue where he is probably not in step with British public opinion, and especially Muslim opinion. That may yet have uncomfortable consequences in some marginal seats. In Cameron's statements in the Commons – the same line taken in TV studios by Conservative cabinet ministers and at the daily lobby briefings by the prime minister's spokespeople – there has been a willingness to describe the deaths of Palestinians as horrifying or appalling. Ministers have refused, however, to describe the toll as disproportionate, and Cameron has continued to argue that is primarily responsible by firing rockets at Israel. The British government, similarly to Blair's in 2006, argues that the best way to maintain political influence with the Israelis is not to criticise them in public, or to indulge in megaphone diplomacy. But there are signs that Warsi's resignation will at least have a short-term consequence. Nick Clegg and the business secretary Vince Cable signalled that the existing review of Israeli arms export licences would shortly be turned into suspension on the basis that some of the terms of those export licences have been breached by the Israeli army – in his words ""overstepping the mark"". More broadly, pressure is bound to be placed on Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza as part of a wider ceasefire deal, one of the proposals set out by coincidence in a report on the Middle East published by the international development select committee. Those who accompanied the PM to the Middle East were struck by his sincere and heartfelt support for Israel in his speech to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, promising to be with the country ""every step of the way"". He has now found that such support comes at a price."
1264	1265	Crimtrac Acorn system could enable cybercrime reporting by mouse click 	Reporting cybercrime could become as easy as clicking a mouse, under a government program to be unveiled soon. The national police information agency, Crimtrac, is putting the final touches to the scheme known as the Australian Online Reporting Network (Acorn). Cybercrime is said to affect about 5.4m Australians each year, at a cost of $1bn. Criminals are becoming more sophisticated and using global networks. CrimTrac CEO Doug Smith told a parliamentary inquiry on Friday the new Acorn scheme, to be launched “shortly”, would complement the work already done by the agency. The agency holds, on behalf of all police forces, the national fingerprint and DNA collections, an 8.7m-record police report database and national child offender records. Acorn will enable people to securely report cybercrime through a website. The types of matters that could be reported include strange texts, emails or phone calls, being tricked into giving personal or banking information, a computer virus attack or cyberbullying. It will also be possible to report the discovery of illegal, banned or “objectionable” material online. Police will determine which matters to investigate, with the Australian Crime Commission providing support with intelligence gathering. Consideration is also being given to a “tech crime offenders registry”.
1268	1269	Cybercrime and hacking are even bigger worries for small business owners 	. It was the talk of Washington at President Obama’s 2015 State of the Union, adding one more city to the world tour of technological fear: London, New York, Los Angeles, Paris. Even though the Charlie Hebdo attacks on the French capital were physical in nature, serious cases of cybercrime were reported soon after. In an effort to stymie these attacks, President Obama and Britain’s Prime Minister Cameron recently announced a joint cybergames war test. And while much of focus has been on attacks on Target, JPMorgan Chase and Sony, small businesses are far from immune. Hackers targeted 19,000 French websites soon after the terror attacks. According to Arbor Networks, France was the target of 1,070 denial of service attacks. (In 2011, hackers breached the PlayStation network, resulting in a shutdown for several weeks. The cost to Sony was $170m.) A report from McAfee found almost 90% of small- and medium-sized business in the US do not use data protection for company and customer information, and less than half secured company email to prevent phishing scams. This is an expensive mistake. Cybercrime and cyberspying cost the US economy $100bn a year and the global economy about $300bn annually, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. According to PwC, the average cost of a firm’s worst security breach is rising significantly. For small businesses, the worst breaches cost between £65,000 and £115,000 on average; for large firms, the damage is between £600,000 and £1.15m. According to a study by PwC for the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the number of security breaches has decreased even as the scale and cost has nearly doubled. However, there has been a marked increase in spending on information security in small businesses. A survey by accounting firm EisnerAmper showed 62% of company directors cited cybersecurity and IT risks as an important concern, up from 53%. But where should an entrepreneur start? First, make sure employees aren’t accessing the wrong kind of websites. Cyrus Walker, CEO of Chicago-based Data Defenders says research shows approximately 80% of security-related incidents occur as a result of employee behavior. Log-aggregation software known as Security Event Information Management gives a clear picture of transactions occurring internally and externally from the company’s network. But not everything an employee does will come through a work computer. Much of the ire of law enforcement is directed at firms such as Apple and Google for software updates that make it impossible to gain access to the content of devices that use their mobile operating systems. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr, speaking at a recent Crain’s New York breakfast, said cybercrime will thrive as long as major consumer-technology companies create privacy locks against employers and law enforcement. “I don’t know anybody in the cyberworld who thinks we are winning. We’re not going in like the NSA. I think Apple and Google should reverse themselves.” “There is some irony is the debate,” said Scott Vernick, a partner at Philadelphia-based Fox Rothschild. “Tech firms are very pro-privacy when it comes to protecting their consumers; less so with how they themselves use it. Vance might be right when it comes to counter-terrorism. You want to have an efficient way to get at this data.” Small-business owners should also scrutinize their vendors, explains John Fodera, a partner at EisnerAmper. “You have to start by doing a cyber-risk assessment and analyze the data from your employees and customers, and how you’re protecting that information”, Fodera advises. “Some breaches, such as Target, came in through a third party. So analyze your vendors to make sure are they complying with your privacy and security policies.” The final piece is cybersecurity insurance. Lloyd’s of London and firms in the United States offer cyber-liability coverage. Coverage depends on what industry you are in. Retail and finance are in the higher-risk bracket. Scott V Lockman, director of commercial insurance for insurance provider Clements Worldwide said: “Cyber-liability protection has been around for about a decade, but insurance companies have become better at identifying risks and are able to underwrite against those risks.” In smaller firms, it is usually the chief financial officer who is responsible for the insurance. Lockman said that person should ask the following questions: How much does the firm utilize the internet? How much information is being stored on it? How are they communicating with their clients? What does that risk mean to them in terms of potential loss? Companies can purchase insurance or train staff internally. Said Mark Clancy, CEO of Soltra: “I use Richard Clarke’s [former national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection and counter-terrorism] definition. You have criminals, hacktivists who are politically motivated, espionage actors and destructive actors. Criminals were those involved with the Target breach.” The Obama administration is proposing a federal system of cyberbreach reporting with a 30-day window. That initiative has been around for many years. “I’m in favor a national standard [at present, each state has its own rules] and I believe 30 days is the right amount of time to report a breach,” said Vernick. “After the Target breach, Minnesota required reporting in five days. I don’t know what you can tell people after five days.” “Criminals are attacking companies, and the firms are responding without any coordination. If you share information, you can change the proverbial locks on the door so they aren’t pickable,” explained Clancy. “Every criminal on the planet lives on your street. You can invest proactively and be ahead of the curve, or invest in response to incidents.”
1281	1282	World Cup 2010: Sceptics drowned out by another rainbow nation miracle 	"o one died. No one was stabbed, no one was kidnapped and no one took a wrong turn into the clutches of a gang of garrotters. One American tourist did get shot – in the arm – but he wasn't here to watch the . History will show that South Africa defied fears of violent chaos to host one of the best-attended World Cups ever. It has put Africa on the global sporting map in a way which seemed unthinkable only six months ago when Togo's footballers were ambushed by machine-gun fire before the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola. Afro-pessimism spiked, with a prophet of doom in the unlikely shape of then Hull City manager Phil Brown questioning whether was up to the job. In fact, low expectations were the hosts' greatest gift. When Armageddon did not happen and smiling crowds flocked to world-class stadiums, it was hailed as a glorious surprise, if not another rainbow nation miracle. The ultimate accolade was that, from the moment of kick-off on 11 June, people were debating French egos rather than burning tyres, goalline cameras rather than CCTV evidence and hands of god rather than hands wielding machetes. As it became clear that matches were kicking off on time, floodlights were staying on and terrorists were staying away, newsmen shrugged and packed their bags. But this World Cup was about much more than what didn't happen. South Africa was an extraordinarily friendly and joyful place to be. Thousands of people in a nation defined by race united in the national colours in stadiums, fan parks and streets. Britain had Beatlemania, America had Obamania, now South had Bafanamania. And the symbol of it all was an irrepressible plastic horn, the vuvuzela, whose buzz-drone noise looks set to be this World Cup's questionable legacy at stadiums around the world. Dr Nikolaus Eberl, author of BrandOvation: How Germany won the World Cup of Nation Branding, said: ""Everyone got very anxious before this World Cup started, but there was a collective energy, including the media, and everyone wanted it to succeed. I would say the vuvuzela is possibly the key ingredient. ""It introduced a tool for all fans to be at the centre of the experience. I was astonished by the way all the foreign fans embraced it. It made the tournament truly fan-centric."" Eberl awarded the tournament a score of nine out of 10. ""The only thing missing was the host team, who went out in the first round, which did deflate things a bit for a while."" Bafana Bafana, who embarked on an open-top bus parade the tournament, became the first hosts to be knocked out in the first round. Continental disappointment was shared by Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. Africans rallied around Ghana, only to be denied by a very professional foul. But the momentum kept going. Danny Jordaan, who today ends a 16-year journey as chief advocate and organiser of Africa's first World Cup, said: ""This is something special, that people came not only to support the South African team, they came to support the event. This has been an incredible experiencefor our country."" Asked what he now had to say to the Afro-pessimists, Jordaan replied: ""The only thing we must tell them is they are now in a very small minority. They missed an incredible experience, they missed an incredible World Cup. Just stay in your corner and sulk."" There were, though, problems off the field. Teargas and rubber bullets were fired at match stewards who went on strike and had to be replaced by police. Transport was predictably imperfect, especially when hundreds of fans missed the Germany v Spain semi-final because an airport was full of private jets. There were muggings and picked pockets – seemingly mostly those of journalists. But only a hundred people were convicted at special World Cup courts. And Fifa came under renewed scrutiny. Ticket sales were badly mishandled, while Fifa marketing officials mounted a draconian crackdown on businesses accused of ""ambush marketing"" in an attempt to protect their corporate family. The cost of it all? About 38bn rand (£3.3bn), the government says, roughly the equivalent of four Millennium Domes and shackled by similar doubts over white elephant stadiums. The economic benefits? With elegant symmetry, also about R38bn, say the government. Fifa, meanwhile, walk away with a reported profit of £2bn, tax free. Jacob Zuma, the South African president, has now hinted at a bid to host the Olympic Games in 2020 or 2024. ""I don't think anyone would say 'No' if South Africa said 'Let us have the Olympics' because they know we have the facilities,"" he said this week. ""Our appetite has been whetted. We might end up asking."" Sepp Blatter, Fifa's president, threw his weight behind a South African Olympic bid, likely to come from Cape Town or Durban. ""If there is any country in Africa that can host the Olympics it is South Africa,"" he said. ""I can tell you now if a country can host a Fifa World Cup successfully, that country can definitely organise the Olympics. I would fully support such a candidature."" As for the World Cup, the baton is now passed to Brazil, with concerns already raised over crime, transport and whether stadiums will be ready on time. Sound familiar?"
1286	1287	Simplocker Android malware locks up mobile data and demands a ransom 	A fresh strain of criminal software has been discovered encrypting the data of smartphone owners, then demanding payment to unlock it. The Simplocker ransomware scans victims' SD memory cards for certain files, including images, PDFs and other documents, and audio files, before locking them using the AES encryption standard, according to security company ESET. It's the first malware found to be encrypting data on Android phones before demanding payment to decrypt it, by ESET's security intelligence team lead Robert Lipovsky. Simplocker asks for a payment of 260 Ukrainian hryvnias (£13) to decrypt victims' files, directing them to the MoneXy transfer service. The malware also sends phone information, such as the IMEI number, to a server controlled by the attackers, which is based on the Tor network. Tor uses encryption and sends communications through a number of difference servers to ensure it’s extremely difficult to track users. In the case of the attackers, it makes their operation that much harder for law enforcement to track and shut down. Should you be worried? Not yet, if you're in the west. Lipovsky said that Simplocker appears to be solely active in the Ukrainian region; is not found on Android's official Play Store; and is not currently widespread. He added that the level of encryption used by Simplocker is significantly weaker than that of Cryptolocker, the aggressive Windows ransomware that global law enforcement authorities have been trying to shut down over the past week. “While the malware does contain functionality to decrypt the files, we strongly recommend against paying up – not only because that will only motivate other malware authors to continue these kinds of filthy operations, but also because there is no guarantee that the crook will keep their part of the deal and actually decrypt them,” Lipovsky added. Various forms of Android ransomware have been uncovered in recent months. In May, security experts , which posed as a porn app. It then sent a message claiming to be from police, telling the user they had broken the law by watching indecent material, demanding they pay a fine of $300. Yet Windows remains the number one target for ransomware. The Guardian reported this week that the Cryptolocker malware has . 
1294	1295	ScarePakage Android ransomware pretends to be FBI porn warning 	"A fresh strain of malware has emerged that locks people out of their phones, then delivers a fake message from the FBI telling them they have broken the law by visiting pornographic websites. The ScarePakage malware then tries to persuade them to pay a $300 fine to its creators via payment service MoneyPak, according to researchers from security company Lookout Mobile Security. , Lookout said that it is launched when users use their Android device to visit a website hosting the malicious code. They will then be prompted to install an app masquerading as Adobe Flash or anti-virus software. Once downloaded, the app triggers the FBI warning, which users can not escape by navigating away. If they turn their phone off and on again, the warning will reappear immediately, while as soon as they try to interact with another app for more than 10 milliseconds, they are cut off and returned to the ransomware notice. ScarePakage looks similar to another malware type called ColdBrother, which was also able to take photos of the victim. For now, ScarePakage appears to be targeting the US. “ScarePakage is likely created by Russian or other Eastern European authors given language cues used in the application that we observed,” explained Lookout. “Unfortunately, this ransomware is hard to remove if you give this malware device administrator privileges.” Advice to avoid ScarePakage includes refusing to award downloaded apps ""device administrator"" status unless you are absolutely sure what they do, as well as only downloading apps from developers you know and trust. ScarePakage is just one of several new strains of ransomware – named for their demands for money in return for letting them access their devices again – to have emerged in recent months. was one of the most concerning, selling for $5000 on cybercriminal forums.

1300	1301	Is there a Rihanna sex tape? No, it's a malware scam on Facebook 	There is no sex tape of Rihanna and her boyfriend doing the rounds online. You can’t see who’s been looking at your Facebook profile. And you can’t change your colour either. This may all sound obvious, but according to antivirus firm Bitdefender, these are the most popular malware scams on the social network in 2014. The company has published a list of the top 10 Facebook scams, with the fake app promising to tell you your Facebook views and visitors by far the most popular, accounting for 30.2% of bogus links it identified on the social network this year. Clicking on any of them will lead Facebook users to sites that try to install viruses on their computers, as malware developers continue to seek new ways to spread their software to unsuspecting victims. The chart is good news for and Disneyland, who both featured in Bitdefender’s list a year ago. Swift’s non-existent sex tape and an offer of a free trip to Disneyland have fallen from the top 10 over the last 12 months. “Why do people still want to see who has been taking a peek at their profile, despite all security warnings? I think they believe these are legitimate apps,” said chief security strategist Catalin Cosoi. “This is social engineering at its finest – a challenging mental game that pushes the right psychological buttons. The baits have changed over time, with stalkers, peekers, admirers, overly attached girlfriends and exes haunting you, but the reason this scam works is simple: human nature.” As with much news of this type, the company responsible for the research also has a commercial agenda: Bitdefender has its own Facebook app that alerts people to potentially-fraudulent posts. The threat is real, however: Facebook’s sheer size – it had 1.32 billion active users in the second quarter of 2014 – makes it an obvious target for malware developers hoping to infect gullible users. The full list of popular Facebook scams is below: suffice to say, if you see any of these sentences appear in your news feed, clicking on them would be an extremely bad idea. 1. Total profile views/visitors – 30.20% 2. Change your Facebook Color/Colour – 7.38% 3. sex tape with her boyfriend – 4.76% 4. Check my status update to get free Facebook T-shirt – 4.21% 5.

1301	1302	What do regular Facebook users need to know about the F8 conference? 	Facebook F8 is the conference holds annually for its engineers and designers, giving them a sneak peek into what's changing on the social network and revealing new products and features. Named after the Facebook tradition of holding an eight-hour hackathon after the presentations, the one-day event is held in San Francisco and is hosted by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, with keynotes, developer sessions and announcements rolling out plans for the next year. We've translated the developer jargon and summarised everything the regular Facebook user needs to know about how their profile will change in the next few months. Facebook’s identity system, which lets users login to other apps and services with their Facebook account, is getting a privacy boost. The new system will allow users to so that they can try out the apps deciding to provide them with their personal information. Facebook can still record which apps are being used, but those apps can't record any personal data.Once the user is happy sharing data with the app, they can chose what is and isn’t shared, so certain information, like birthdays or friends lists, can stay hidden hidden. The new anonymous login features will be rolling out soon. Facebook makes money by using its data about users to sell targeted ads to advertisers. That advertising business has just been bolstered - the , or Fan. Fan allows developers to use Facebook’s ad-targeting systems as well as its ad service to generate money from their apps, in the same way that Apple has iAds and Google AdMob. The ads will take the form of traditional banner ads in mobile apps, as well as large boxes. Facebook aims to make its ads slightly higher quality than some others, making sure that publishers can only show one ad on screen at any one time, and that they don't obscure buttons or generally causes irritation. Advertisers won't get access to a user’s private data, but the different way Facebook is using its powerful trove of targeting data shows it is starting to think about how to use this across other sites and services. As a result, there is less pressure for the social network to push ads on Facebook, which could eventually see a reduction in ads in your News Feed, maybe. Zuckerberg went to pains to point out that Facebook has grown up, moving beyond its “move fast and break things” mentality to that of a more mature company. As a result the Zuckerberg pledged to fix major bugs in Facebook within 48 hours, and said the company would no longer rush to change things unless they had been thoroughly tested. That should make Facebook more stable. Facebook will launch a new mobile app called , which aims to make it easier to use links that switch between apps and web pages. In April 2013 Facebook bought , a back-end cloud service for apps, on which AppLinks service is based. Evernote users, for example, could click on a link to an Evernote doc in an email, which would automatically open the Evernote app, but revert back to the email when done. Both Android and Apple’s iOS have a basic ability to do that, but Facebook wants to make the whole experience uniform across mobiles, tablets and desktop, and is offering AppLinks as an open-source initiative - presumably to offer better integration between third-party apps and Facebook apps.

In an , Obama revealed he was moved to tears while viewing Lee Daniels' historically themed film, which centres on a black White House member of staff who serves seven presidents. ""I teared up thinking about not just the butlers who worked here in the White House, but an entire generation of people who were talented and skilled. But because of Jim Crow and because of discrimination, there was only so far they could go,"" the president said.

The president also discussed meeting real-life African American members of White House staff. ""When Michelle and the girls and I first arrived, they could not have been kinder to us and warmer to us,"" Obama said. ""And part of it, I suppose, is they look at Malia and Sasha and they say, 'This looks like my grandbaby,' or 'This looks like my daughter'. I think for them to have a sense that we've come that far was a powerful moment for them, and certainly a powerful moment for us. We love them to death. They look after us just wonderfully.""

With the federal treasurer, Joe Hockey, calling on the states to consider asset sales, report author John Quiggin said complaints against power companies had increased after privatisation. “Prices have risen dramatically,” Quiggin, an economist, said. “My research comprehensively finds that the free-market based reform process in energy has been a failure.” had seen funds diverted away from operational costs to management and marketing, with consumers also paying higher interest rates on private sector debt, the report said. Reliability had also declined in Victoria. But Queensland energy minister, Mark McArdle, hit back at the ETU, describing it as “a senior member of the Labor party family”. He said the government would not sell CS Energy or Stanwell Corporation without an election mandate. “The Newman government will have a mature, disciplined discussion with Queenslanders in 2014 about ... the sale of some government owned businesses to fund improved services and infrastructure,” he said. The report comes as Hockey asks the states and territories to sell assets as a way of funding infrastructure. He will push that idea at a meeting of G20 finance ministers this weekend. The ETU’s Queensland secretary, Peter Simpson, said consumers and those employed in the energy sector had suffered in Victoria under privatisation. “This research provides a factual basis to drive decision-making, rather than a reliance on free market ideology,” he said.

All the major banks are handing top staff “allowances” in shares to get round the bonus cap, which restricts bonuses to one times salary unless shareholders approve payouts of twice the size of a salary. Lloyds, in which the taxpayer has a 24% stake, is spinning out 631 branches under the TSB brand because of conditions imposed at the time of its £20bn bailout. The second tranche is being sold now because a 90-day period between sell-offs has elapsed since the previous sale, and because of the no vote in the Scottish independence referendum, which TSB and Lloyds had said would cause them to move business from Scotland. The branches were supposed to be have been sold by now but the process has been delayed because of the failed attempt to sell them to Co-operative Bank. Royal Bank of Scotland, 81% owned by the taxpayer, has to sell more than 300 branches under the terms imposed by the EU at the time of its £45bn bailout. Those branches are to be branded Williams & Glyn – a name last seen on the high street 30 years ago.

The joint CEO Anshu Jain told analysts on Monday that the fresh capital would also help it meet ""unforeseen challenges"". Jain said it was impossible to quantify the additional demands that watchdogs might place on banks as regulatory efforts continued. The chief financial officer, Stefan Krause, said the bank also faced a ""challenging and unpredictable litigation environment"" even after setting aside billions of euros for fines and lawsuits. The capital increase comes as banks across Europe have been shedding risky investments and raising new financial buffers to meet new regulatory standards aimed at strengthening the banking system. The European Central Bank is conducting a detailed review of large banks' finances and holdings as it prepares to take over as the European Union's centralised banking supervisor in November. The bank said on Sunday it would raise €6.3bn via a rights offering in which investors are asked to put up more money, and that it had already secured €1.75bn by placing shares with Paramount Holdings Services, an investment vehicle owned by Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabor al-Thani of Qatar. The move will raise the bank's capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, to 11.8%, well beyond the bank's 10% goal."

They follow on from Sir Ian Wood's devastating criticism that the Scottish government has wildly overstated oil reserves. ""On the very day that he is promising enhanced childcare, they show a significant downward trend in oil-related tax revenues that are a vital component of our public finances. ""They add to the overwhelming evidence that can better afford the quality public services it deserves by staying as part of the United Kingdom, and not by separating. Mr Salmond is guilty of promising the earth, but not having the oil and tax revenues to pay for it. ""The Scottish government has over-forecast total oil and gas revenues by £5bn over the past two years. ""Despite this, the Scottish government's plans for independence rely on generating more than double the amount of North Sea tax forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility."""
1348	1349	Veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell to stand down, sparking battle for seat 	"The veteran MP Austin Mitchell has called on Ed Miliband to ""get out and mix with ordinary people more"" as he announced he will stand down from his Great Grimsby seat at the next election. The 80-year-old MP said he was stepping aside ""basically because of age"" after 37 years representing the area. It comes after rumours that he was intending to step down to free up the seat for Melanie Onns, a former head of compliance at Labour party headquarters. Speaking to the Guardian, Mitchell said Miliband was ""doing OK"" but he had to ""bring the debate down to the level of ordinary people more"". ""He needs to get out and mix with ordinary people more,"" he said. ""Policies will come over the summer but he needs to swing the public debate back to the people."" In particular, Miliband must address the fact that wages and salaries as a proportion of GDP have shrunk hugely, he added. After announcing his decision to his local constituency, Mitchell said it was a ""very moving"" event for him but time to hand over to someone who was ""fresher"". Great Grimsby was long a very safe Labour seat but Mitchell's majority fell to just 714 at the last election. The MP has represented the fishing port since 1977, when he won the seat in a byelection caused by the death of the former foreign secretary Tony Crosland. He previously worked as a political science lecturer in New Zealand and as a broadcaster and journalist with the BBC and Yorkshire Television. Although best known as a backbencher, Mitchell is a former opposition spokesman on trade and industry and opposition whip. He is currently a member of the influential public accounts committee."
1352	1353	David Cameron conference speech fails to win over women voters to Tories 	"Do David Cameron's Conservatives have a women problem? Support for the party's policies is dramatically lower than it is among men, according to before the start of conference season, and Cameron clearly has work to do to win back women. There is a 13% gap between women's support for Labour and the Tories, four times larger than Labour leader Ed Miliband's lead among men. The reaction to his speech from a panel of women from the parenting website was mixed, though almost all admitted to being disappointed not to hear more about the issues that matter to them. ""From a mum's perspective, there wasn't a huge amount that made me think: 'Oh great, that's really going to help my life', "" said Mandy Sharp, who works in marketing and lives in Elstree, Hertfordshire with her partner and two children. ""It skirted the main issues but I don't feel there was any depth on the subjects I wanted to hear about. where's the childcare stuff? Where's the nursery stuff? Education? The things that matter to me."" Kasie Barton from Holt in Norfolk, who has a one-year-old son, agreed. ""He didn't really go into much depth, especially in the issues I wanted to hear about."" Barton, who works for a recruitment firm called MaternityCover.com, lists affordable childcare, the availability of flexible work for young mothers and workplace rights as priorities for her and many of her friends. ""I'm very much pro-business, in favour of making the most of what you have got, but at the same time I am concerned that there's a lack of support for women on their own or having to survive on one salary."" Sarah Roussinov, a mother of two who runs her own beauty business in London, said the Tories had never had her vote, even though, as a child of an immigrant who is married to an immigrant, she agreed something should be done to ""stem the flow"" of people coming to Britain to claim benefits. Both she and her husband work between 60 and 85 hours a week, she said, but they still struggle to make ends meet. ""I feel very strongly that the people at the top of the Conservative party have no idea or sympathy for what it's like to stand in the middle of a supermarket with £25 and know that you need to make it feed four for a week."" Ruth Mendes from Eastbourne, a single mother who is self-employed, said she would like to vote Labour but felt more sympathetic to Tory policies on welfare. ""In my work I see people who are not working and will probably never work, and I feel they live quite comfortably on the befits they get. It does make me angry that I am struggling to make ends meet."" Like several of the other mothers, however, she felt there was ""far too much pressure [from the government] on women going back to work when their children are under five"", and felt the coalition should be doing more to protect local hospital services, with her local maternity unit having recently closed. ""I didn't feel there were many concrete policies at all,"" said Elaine de Rivaz from Kingston upon Thames, a self-employed mother of two. She disagreed with Cameron's assertion that social work should be a career for ""the brightest graduates"", fearing it excluded others, and was disappointed to hear nothing on inheritance tax, sustainable energy or tuition fees, which she believes are elitist and should be abolished. In general, however, she had liked the PM's speech. ""I'm not delighted by everything the Tories have come up with but I would say they are the best of a bad bunch."" This article was amended on 7 October 2013 to clarify that polling into women's voting intentions was done by Ipsos Mori/Mumsnet."

Online security firm Bitdefender issued the warning about the malware, which it believes was developed in Albania. The link is designed to look like a YouTube video, but when clicked, leads them to sites that try to install the malicious software under the guise of an update to Adobe's Flash software. “Scammers have created over 20,000 unique URLs that redirect victims to malicious websites and a fake alluring YouTube video, showing a woman taking her clothes off on a webcam,” said Bitdefender's chief security strategist Catalin Cosoi. “The video seems to actually play for a couple of seconds to entice male users to click. writers faked the number of views so the video seems to have been watched by over a million users.” The hackers are using shortened URLs from internet service bit.ly to mask the malicious website addresses, although Bitdefender says it has notified the company about the issue. Once installed, the Trojan.Agent.BDYV malware can work within browsers including Chrome and , tagging friends on Facebook and preventing infected users from deleting its posts from their timelines.

1358	1359	How to make sex 'more awesome' using Google Glass 	"Would you wear a pair of Google glasses while having sex? Would being able to see what your partner is seeing make you more or less likely to? , a new app in development for Google Glass, hopes the answer is yes. The project started off with the question ""how can we make sex more awesome with Glass"", says Sherif Maktabi, the founder of the project. The answer to that question is, apparently, shared live streaming, ephemeral video recording and voice controls for your connected home. Maktabi, a Lebanese product design student at London's Central Saint Martins art college, had only one day with the smart-glasses at a hackathon held in November 2013, but development has continued in the months since then. The cornerstone of with Glass is the shared live streaming: ""See what your partner can see… Just say 'OK glass, it’s time' and Glass will stream what you see to each other. And if you feel like stopping everything, just ask: 'OK glass, pull out'."" ""Some people find what we do repulsive,"" Maktabi says. ""But a lot of other people – and I am basing this from the emails we are getting online – really desire to try this. People have fantasies, desires and needs. It's personal. ""What they do with that is up to them. Guilt, dogma and shame is something we still widely experience when it comes to sex and how we talk about it."" As well as sharing viewpoints, the app also offers video to users who want to replay the night – although the videos are deleted automatically five hours after they are created.  On top of that, if the user's home is wired up correctly, the app can control other the lights and music, as well as present a virtual Kama Sutra to anyone who needs inspiration. Reaction to the app has been mixed. Maktabi cites responses ""that range from 'I want to have this now because I want to try it with my boyfriend'"", to ""I want to write about the anthropological impact of this app on…"", and adds that his favourites are ""those anonymous messages that just say 'awesome'"". But others have pointed out that the promotion for the app doesn't match up with the egalitarian promises: most of the images are sexualised photos of women, the advertising slogans assume heterosexual couples, and some of the statements are just plain odd (""You'll be able to watch your videos for five hours until they are deleted forever. That's for all the ladies out there."") Since the Hackathon, the team has grown to include Sabba Keynejad and Satara Achilles, a pair of graphic designers from Central Saint Martins, and an iPhone app is now in the works, to be launched in early February. Despite Google's crackdown on other sexy Glass apps, including  , Maktabi sounds unconcerned about its response: ""People at Google know. And they are happy and had a good laugh. But I don't know what Google 'the thing' thinks of what we are doing.""  "
1367	1368	Apple reveals iPhone and iPad owners spent $10bn on apps in 2013 	" and iPad owners spent more than $10bn (£6.1bn) on apps and in-app purchases from Apple's App Store in 2013, including more than $1bn in the final month of the year. announced the figures today, while noting that iOS developers have earned more than $15bn since the store's launch in July 2008. The company takes a 30% cut of app sales, indicating more than $21.4bn of spending on and within iOS apps in the five-and-a-half year period. The announcement differs notably from , when it revealed that iOS users had downloaded nearly 20bn apps in 2012, but gave no figures for consumer spending for that year, although it did say that total payouts to developers had reached $7bn by the end of 2012. Comparing the two announcements also reveals that more than 225,000 new iOS apps were launched in 2013, taking the App Store catalogue from 775,000 at the end of 2012 to more than 1m a year later. December iOS downloads increased by 50% from 2bn in 2012 to 3bn in 2013, too. It is no surprise to see Apple publicising iOS spending and developer payouts. Google's rival Android platform now has a much bigger market share for smartphones, and is eroding the iPad's share of the tablet market too. With Google still not giving out spending and payout figures for Android, Apple's pitch is that it still provides the most lucrative platform for developers. Will this remain the case in 2014? In December, app analytics company Distimo claimed that , estimating that on a typical day in November, global revenues for the 200 top grossing iOS apps were more than $18m versus $12m for the comparable selection on Google Play – compared to $15m and $3.5m respectively a year before. Apple's latest figures suggest that in December, all iOS apps – not just the top 200 – were generating $32.3m a day, on average – while over the whole of 2013, the $8bn of developer payouts suggest average daily iOS app revenues of $27.4m. Apple's latest announcement praises the work of companies including Evernote, Yahoo, Airbnb, OpenTable, Tumblr, Pinterest and American Airlines to update their apps for its iOS 7 operating system in 2013, while singling out some of the most successful iOS apps of the year: ""surprise hits"" including Heads Up, Moves, Afterlight and Impossible Road, as well as other games Candy Crush Saga, Puzzle & Dragons, Minecraft, QuizUp and Clumsy Ninja. ""The lineup of apps for the holiday season was astonishing and we look forward to seeing what developers create in 2014,"" said Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue in a statement, which also picked out independent firms Duolingo, Simogo, Frogmind, Plain Vanilla, Atypical Games, Lemonista, Base and Savage Interactive as ""developers to watch in 2014""."
1370	1371	Carl Icahn adds $500m in Apple shares to put stake at more than $3bn 	"Corporate raider Carl Icahn said Wednesday that he had upped his stake in by $500m as he steps up pressure on the technology company to hand some of its giant cash hoard over to shareholders. ""Having purchased $500m more $AAPL shares in the last two weeks, our investment has crossed the $3bn mark yesterday,"" Icahn Wednesday morning. The move comes as Apple prepares to release its latest quarterly results on Monday. Last year the activist investor began pressuring Apple to buy back “not less than” $50bn of its shares. The company has cash reserves of roughly $150bn, much of it sitting in offshore bank accounts. Apple “is not a bank”, Icahn told Reuters last year. Apple's board of directors ""is doing great disservice to shareholders by not having markedly increased its buyback,"" Icahn Wednesday. He said an ""in-depth"" letter would follow soon. Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook met with Icahn last September, and Icahn described the meeting as “cordial”. The company has, however, formally rejected his proposal and called on shareholders to do likewise at its annual shareholder meeting in February. The company has announced it plans to spend up to $100bn on dividends and up to $60bn on share buybacks in the next few years. Icahn disclosed his stake in Apple last August, when the stock was trading at $468. Apple shares topped $556 in morning trading Wednesday but are down from a high of $700 in September 2012. “Since tweeting about our large position in $AAPL on Aug 13, when the stock was 468 per share, we’ve kept buying shares of this ‘no brainer.’” Ichan tweeted. The investor’s $3bn stake, however, does not make him even one of Apple’s 30 largest shareholders. His position in the company, which is now valued at over $500bn, represents less than 1% of the shares outstanding."
1376	1377	HP's Palm purchase: the analysis 	"as it a good idea for , the world's biggest computer company, to buy Palm – which now specialises in mobile phones – for $1.2bn? The initial response from analysts has been as mixed as you'd expect – see the comments from Forrester, Gartner, IDC, Informa, and Ovum below – but almost everything depends on what HP intends to do with its new company. At one extreme, the takeover could just involve a change from a Palm that's struggling in the smartphone business to a Palm with the cash (and the resulting market confidence) to create a successful smartphone business. That's IDC's basic view. At the other extreme, HP could be more interested in owning its own operating system across phones and mobile devices (and being free of in those areas), much like Apple. That seems to be the view held by Informa Telecoms & Media. But in the long term, it also depends on how these market areas turn out. Previously, Palm and many rivals – including Microsoft and – took the view that the mobile phone business would develop like previous technology platform businesses. Typically these start with one or a few small companies that supply an end-to-end solution, but develop into large industries to which many companies contribute parts. This involves a change from vertical organisation (where one company provides the hardware, software, online service, shops etc) to a horizontal organisation (where different companies provide the chips, operating system, services etc). Palm split itself into hardware and software divisions, and Nokia helped set up Symbian, precisely to enable a move from a vertical (owned and mostly closed) organisation to a horizontal one (open licensing). Both wanted to avoid Apple's mistake in staying with a vertical organisation: that while the bits work together, you end up with 2% (or so) market share. But the mobile phone and media tablet markets won't necessarily follow the sort of path that has become well known in the computer industry, and change from vertical to horizontal structures. They could, instead, reduce to a few vertically-oriented companies. That's how the games console business still works, with platforms owned and closely controlled by (currently) , Nintendo and Microsoft. Apple's iPad is another example of a vertically-organised highly-controlled system, exactly like Sony's PlayStation Portable, for example. This kind of structure works better in the consumer market than the business market, because businesses hate the prospect of being overcharged by companies who realise they don't have a choice. Consumers just throw their gadgets away. If HP sees the market becoming Balkanised so that a handful of competitors (Apple, RIM, Microsoft, Nokia) own and control their own platforms, then buying Palm makes perfect sense. It will have its own platform. But if the market is going to tip to a horizontal one, where a few companies compete to provide software (Google, Microsoft, Symbian), many compete with hardware (Samsung, LG, Sony, Dell etc), and many compete with services (AT&T, Verizon, Orange etc) then the Palm purchase may not work out too well. HP is, of course, capable at both types of business. It's the world's biggest supplier of Windows PCs, a horizontal business, and it is also the world's biggest supplier of printers, where vertical lock-in drives profitability. At the moment, we don't know which way HP plans to go. Does it know itself? ""The good news is that HP made a strong move toward becoming a player in the mobile market. The bad news is that it's the wrong move. Palm could be valued for its brand, its intellectual property, its platform, or its people. HP doesn't need the Palm brand; the IP helps an existing player not a new entrant; we don't think the WebOS platform is viable long term in the face of its competition; and HP could sweep up Palm's people individually at a much lower price. HP needs a strong presence in mobile, but Palm doesn't deliver that."" ""We believe HP's purchase of Palm shows a clear intention to enter the consumer mobile device market. The pairing has merit: HP brings financial strength and broad reach; Palm brings a set of consumer-focused hardware, OS, application store and intellectual property. HP has made a clear commitment to invest in Palm's technologies and has hinted at ambitious plans that go beyond smartphones. But neither Palm nor HP have a strong presence in the consumer market. Most significantly, they lack momentum around mobile application stores and a developer ecosystem. It will take time for HP to build up such an ecosystem, and it faces extremely strong competitors like and Android. The consumer smartphone market moves quickly and HP will have to act fast."" ""This is a good move for both companies. HP always struggled to grow its smartphone business unit because it never knew how to make mobile phones. The iPaq devices never were successful, and HP only achieved 0.1% market share in 2009. On the other hand, Palm developed a good operating system but was struggling to sell its new WebOS devices, Palm Pre and Palm Pixi, because money makes the difference at point of sale. Palm's worldwide market share was 1.5% in 2009. If HP didn't have the right products to become a smart phone player, Palm didn't have the money to compete with Apple and RIM in the US market and to make the brand known outside its home market. This deal takes a good operating system to the right hands and to the next level. ""In the short-term, the impact of this deal will be felt in the US market and Nokia will be one of the most affected players. When a company has a good product and the money for marketing activities, it creates a problem for its competitors. With money to invest, Palm will be able to leverage its brand, broaden its portfolio, and provide carriers with the money they need to sell devices. Money brings success if you have the right product, as Palm has. Palm's survival no longer seems to be a problem, for the time being, but one question remains: will HP allow Palm to drive the business the way it wants and back it up with cash? To HP, smart phones are not new – it always had money, but it never succeeded. Will things be different this time? Yes, if HP takes advantage of the convergence with mobile, but sticks to the business it knows best – printers."" ""After several seeming knock-backs from specialist handset manufacturers, HP's rescue of Palm will be great news for the Palm faithful and undoubtedly the best deal for Palm – the Palm brand continues to receive a considerable following and goodwill from the North American public and HP is serious about boosting its image and presence in the connected consumer device space. WebOS could indeed become a major asset for HP and obviously has scope for use on devices such as tablets – Palm's engineers and designers clearly put a lot of time and effort into creating a very slick user experience. However, HP will need to drive traction for WebOS among developers, if it is to truly capitalise on that potential. ""That may not prove easy – as Ovum's recent survey of mobile application developers shows, application writers show an overwhelming desire to support three or perhaps four device platforms. With at least that many already dominating the space, HP may have its work cut out proving the revenue earning potential of WebOS devices to developers."" ""The acquisition of Palm seems to be a good fit for HP; however, it will be interesting to see how the combined organisation will operate – particularly as neither HP's Windows Mobile business focused devices nor Palm's webOS handsets have been particularly successful in the mobile handset market. I'm not convinced the Palm devices will add much to HP's portfolio (relatively poor sales, build quality, etc). ""It appears that HP intends to use webOS in other device types, much as Apple has extended iPhone OS X to the iPad. However, there are still issues with awareness and applications development, which is paramount to success in the smartphone market. Also, does that mean HP will not make Android smartphones and focus solely on webOS devices? This could prove to be a restrictive strategy in the fast growing smartphone market. Distribution is key, as Google recently learned. Traditionally, HP has a very good distribution network that will help channel to market but it will need to work closely with mobile operators, a weakness of Palm's, in order to succeed."""
1380	1381	Music streaming breaks through $1bn sales barrier 	"Music subscription services including and Deezer have broken through the $1bn (£600m) sales barrier worldwide as increasing numbers of fans choose to pay for music online. Streaming and subscription revenues rose by more than 50% over the past year to reach $1.1bn, helping overall sales of recorded music in Europe grow for the first time in 12 years, according to figures published yesterday. There are now an estimated 450 music rental services around the world, and while many people still listen for free, a desire for more choice is persuading more music lovers to part with their cash. In a three-year period the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the . Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people looking to try out new music without committing to buying a download or a physical CD. Consumers say they are attracted by a cheap, user friendly and legal alternative to pirated downloads. ""It is now clear that music streaming and subscription is a mainstream model for our business,"" said IFPI chief executive Frances Moore. The IFPI also said that One Direction were the biggest selling artists last year, with 4m physical and digital sales for their Midnight Memories album. Katy Perry's Prism was the best selling album by a female artist, in sixth place behind Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars and Daft Punk. Consumer technology companies have been racing to join the music streaming trend, with Apple launching iTunes Radio and Google promoting its Play store, with smaller players like Beats Music, created by the team behind the Beats headphones brand, also joining the fray. There are signs that in Britain and America streaming may soon generate more revenue for the music industry than downloads from online stores such as Apple's iTunes. Subscription services now account for a third of all digital sales globally, with downloads making up the balance, but the IFPI data shows that the two formats are growing at different rates. In the US the number of people claiming to use subscription and streaming rose from 19% in 2012 to 23%, while the number downloading fell from 28% to 27%. In Britain downloaders remained static at exactly one third, while subscribers grew from 19% to 22%. In Sweden, France and Italy streaming is already more popular than downloading. Digital formats now account for 39% of all music sales, or nearly £5.9bn out of £15bn, and while sales of physical CDs and vinyl declined steeply in 2013, they still contribute just over half the industry's income. A recent crash in music sales in Japan, which accounts for one fifth of music industry sales and where physical formats remained popular for longer than elsewhere, meant sales across all formats globally fell 3.9%. However, vinyl continued to make a comeback. Sales increased by 32% in America and by 101% in the UK in 2013."
1386	1387	Facebook bows to pressure on privacy settings for new users 	" has responded to frustration over its privacy policies by switching off the default setting that led many users to accidentally share their posts with the entire world wide web. Anyone joining Facebook from Thursday will only share their posts with friends and family, unless they explicitly choose to make their information open to everyone online, according to a on the company's blog. The change will not affect its existing 1.28bn account holders, who will be prompted to carry out a ""privacy check-up"". Facebook is facing stiff competition from a wave of social apps such as Snapchat, Secret and WhatsApp – which it recently acquired for $19bn (£11bn) – that have made discretion a selling point. The company's privacy product manager, Mike Nowak, said the decision to reduce the risk of new users over-sharing was taken in response to feedback from its subscribers. ""If people share more publicly than they want to be sharing, that doesn't benefit us because it leads to bad experiences over time,"" said Nowak. ""We want people's first impressions of Facebook to be as awesome as possible, and we know it's worse to accidentally overshare than to accidentally undershare."" When it first allowed users to share posts publicly in 2009, the default setting was public, allowing anyone else online to see them. Facebook's decision was a hit with online advertisers eager to glean as much data as possible on its millions of users, but has been a constant source of concern for the public. In 2011, the company was forced into a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, vowing to never make deceptive claims about its privacy procedures and agreeing to independent reviews of its practices. Most recently, by a group of parents on whether it can use their children's images in adverts without consent. For the last decade, Facebook has pushed the boundaries of privacy, encouraging and occasionally forcing account holders to share increasing amounts of information. But have encouraged Silicon Valley's technology companies to take a stand on protecting their users' information, and regulators in Europe and America have begun to act to protect the rights of individuals online. Last week, the , in favour of a complainant arguing for the right to be forgotten by the search engine. ""They have gotten enough privacy black eyes at this point that I tend to believe they realised they have to take care of consumers a lot better,"" said Pam Dixon, executive director of the campaign group World Forum. This spring, Facebook introduced a privacy mascot in the shape of a blue dinosaur, dubbed ""Zuckersaurus"" after the social network's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, which pops up as people are about to release posts, prompting the user to make sure they are not sharing more widely than they intended. In its post on the change, Facebook said: ""While some people want to post to everyone, others have told us that they are more comfortable sharing with a smaller group, like just their friends. We recognise that it is much worse for someone to accidentally share with everyone when they actually meant to share just with friends, compared with the reverse."""
1388	1389	Google 'bans' facial recognition on Google Glass - but developers persist 	"Google will not allow apps that implement facial recognition on its product, the company says, citing privacy concerns, after an American company said it would offer a commercial service to recognise celebrities and others. Developers have pointed out though that it is possible to load apps - which calls ""Glassware"" - onto the wearable system without needing Google's permission. Those could then communicate with any of a growing number of services which say they can connect a name with a face once given a photo. Equally, users could simply upload still pictures to other online services which would provide the facial recognition service. ""A 'ban' is purely symbolic,"" commented Martin Macdonald, a marketing director for Expedia EAN who has tried Google Glass. The developers behind Lambda Labs, which offers a paid-for facial recognition service, : ""Don't worry, we think it's a core feature. Google will allow it or be replaced with something that does."" Being able to recognise faces has looked to a number of observers like an ideal application for Glass, because the device can ""see"" what the user is looking at, and display data such as a name in a small screen at the top right of the visual field which is invisible to outside observers. That, in turn, would drive demand for such apps. Google though suggests that it stands as an intermediary between any online services and the display output on Glass, according to its , which says in part: ""Google handles all of the necessary details of syncing between your Glassware and your users' Glass."" The result could be a cat-and-mouse game between Google and facial recognition providers. The search giant is able to kill apps remotely which it decides are ""undesirable"", and it can force software updates on the devices which could block access to certain services. But companies could change the sites or destinations that services connect to in order to recognise faces - which would then require another blocking update. Google has already come under pressure from US Congressional members, who demanding to know how it would prevent ""unintentional"" collection of data, protect the privacy of non-users, and whether it would implement facial recognition. They demanded responses by 14 June. Apparently in response to the last of those concerns, the Google Glass project team that ""Many have expressed both interest and concern around the possibility of facial recognition in Glass. As Google has said for several years, we won't add facial recognition features to our products without having strong privacy protections in place. With that in mind, we won't be approving any facial recognition Glassware at this time."" Google has previously backed off introducing facial recognition systems in smartphones in Europe, which would have let people identify someone from a camera picture. Glass, a wearable system that can take still and video pictures and upload them to the internet in real time using a Bluetooth-connected smartphone, as well as using voice recognition and location data to provide information about the surroundings. The company has indicated that it wants to begin selling it for broad consumer use within the next year, and began its in spring. However Glass is not a closed system, and Google itself provided the information needed for developers to ""hack"" its Glass systems to provide such services during a session at its I/O conference in May called "" "". Those methods are from computers rather than via Google's services. It also offers facial recognition in its Google+ Photos app, previously known as Picasa. At least two companies, and , have been working on facial recognition services aimed at Glass users. Lambda Labs, which offers facial recognition systems at prices ranging from zero to $256 per month, has said it is already making money from the service it offers for online use. Speaking at the end of May, Lambda Labs's co-founder Stephen Balaban ""There is nothing in the Glass Terms of Service that explicitly prevents us from doing this. However, there is a risk that Google may change the ToS in an attempt to stop us from providing this functionality. This is the first face recognition toolkit for Glass, so we're just not sure how Google, or the privacy caucus, will react."" Balaban has been contacting owners of Glass devices recently, apparently to get them to test the API. Google has , which now includes a clause saying ""Don't use the camera or microphone to cross-reference and immediately present personal information identifying anyone other than the user, including use cases such as facial recognition and voice print. Applications that do this will not be approved at this time."" A Google spokesperson said: ""Our Explorer Program makes users active participants in evolving Glass ahead of a wider consumer launch. In keeping with this approach, we've updated our developer policies.

Xbox and , the two biggest names in video games, go head to head over hundreds of millions of pounds in consumer cash. Microsoft's Xbox One launched with a spectacular live show in London's Leicester Square. Sony's will arrive on Friday in what is expected to be an equally lavish affair. Never before have two games consoles of this scale launched so close to one another. The UK games industry is spending £68m on advertising both these new machines and their games to ensure they are this year's must-have Christmas gifts. Over the past eight years , with its Xbox 360, has been the UK's top-selling console maker, while Sony, with its PS3, has struggled. Now PlayStation is tipped to make a comeback with its more affordable PS4. The Japanese company seems to have renewed vigour under the leadership of British-born Andrew House, who became president in 2011 and is tasked with taking on Xbox. Both and PS4 are expected to sell out this Christmas – and that's good news for the British games industry. Many of the most-anticipated video games for both consoles are being created here, including blockbusters such as , and . This comes just a few months after the UK recorded its biggest video game success to date. , created by Scottish development studio Rockstar North, broke sales records in September by making £308m in a single day. One and PS4 also arrive at a crucial time for the UK high street. Sales of hard-copy video games have declined in recent years as consumers spend more time and money on downloadable games for tablets and smartphones. And this has had a significant impact on retailers such as HMV and Game, which have closed hundreds of stores over the past two years. Meanwhile, Blockbuster – another key games retailer – is on the verge of disappearing altogether after going into administration for a second time this month. The launch of these new games systems is expected to be a huge boost to the retailers. Kim Bayley, director-general of the Entertainment Retailers Association, said: ""The drama and excitement generated by Playstation 4 and Xbox One look set to produce the sales boost retailers have been crying out for."" Both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One offer a number of impressive innovations over previous consoles. The latter boasts a more advanced Kinect camera, which allows families to control the TV and games with gestures and voice commands. The new camera can pick up the gamer's heart rate and the slightest movements of the hand, and can even render console owners in full 3D. Meanwhile, PlayStation 4's new controller features a touchpad interface, and gamers will be able to upload videos of their games to YouTube simply by pressing a button. Fans who also own the portable PlayStation Vita machine will be able to stream games from the PS4 and play them on the handheld, so that other members of the family can use the television set."
1410	1411	From Snapchat to Twitter: five biggest technology bust-ups 	"The technology industry is a place where an idea scrawled on the back of an envelope in a college dorm room can become a multimillion-dollar company overnight. Maturity, social skills and being a team player are meaningless, as long as you're a whiz coder or can invent that app people didn't know they needed. Last week, Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer, fired the company's chief operating officer Henrique de Castro just 15 months after she persuaded him to follow her to the struggling internet company from Google. of a personality clash were already circulating a couple of months into de Castro's time there, and this week we learned that when he joined Yahoo in 2012 he was , Mayer. Tensions could have stemmed from this fact, with Mayer earning $36.6m annually, compared with de Castro's $39.2m. For the 15 months he's worked at Yahoo, he'll have received – including severance – a figure somwhere between $88 to $109m.  And it's not the first time huge stakes have failed to stop conflict tearing though a successful tech business. As with most classic tech bust-ups, this one involves American Ivy League students and a fraternity – in this case, Stanford’s Kappa Sigma. Snapchat co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were taken to court by fellow Stanford student Reggie Brown, who claims he came up with the idea of disappearing photos, designed the logo and thought of the company's original name, Picaboo. Each day on Snapchat, 400m photos are now shared and current CEO Spiegel has reportedly turned down buyout  for as much as $4bn. Brown claims disagreements led his co-founders to secretly create a new company that cut him out. Spiegel and Murphy called the lawsuit ""frivolous"". The lawsuit is ongoing.  The idea for is said to have come out of a conversation between two college dropouts in a car one rainy day on San Fransisco's Mission Street. Seven years later and Jack Dorsey, one of those college dropouts, pocketed $1.5bn in the company's initial public offering. Noah Glass, the other, received, erm, about as much as Dorsey's secretary. Twitter's market capitalisation is nearly $40bn. According to Glass, he was pushed out by Dorsey in his bid for more power over the company. In a notorious , Noah Glass opens up about the conflict: ""I didn’t create Twitter on my own. It came out of conversations. I do know that without me, Twitter wouldn’t exist."" Noah Glass's Twitter bio still reads: ""I started this"". Dorsey he was responsible for Glass being fired, saying he ""didn't have that leverage"" in the company. Paul Allen met Bill Gates, almost three years his junior, at Lakeside high school in Seattle. The two bonded over their shared love for computers and, in 1975, when Allen was 22 and Gates was 19, the pair founded .  In a n 2011, Paul Allen claimed Gates tried to cheat him out of his fair share of the company – to make matters worse, Allen was suffering from cancer at the time. He describes overhearing Gates discussing ways to dilute his stake in the firm and says he burst into the room, shouting, ""This is unbelievable! It shows your true character, once and for all.""  ""While my recollection of many of these events may differ from Paul's, I value his friendship and the important contributions he made to the world of technology and at Microsoft,"" Gates wrote in a statement to the . The relationship never recovered and Allen refused to sell his stake in the firm, which was a wise move. After Microsoft went public in 1986, he became one of the richest men in the world. He has fallen slightly in the rankings since then, but he is still worth an estimated $15bn. The rift that emerged between Apple's Steve Jobs and Google's Eric Schmidt has developed into the in the technology industry. Schmidt was forced to abandon his role on Apple's board in 2009 after he entered Google into the mobile phone market with its competing Android products. Schmidt still maintains that Google's Android project began before Apple started developing the iPhone. Before his death in 2011, Jobs was adamant that Google's Android ripped off the iPhone. A biography of the Apple CEO , ""I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40bn in the bank, to right this wrong... I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."" Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has been surrounded by feuds since the social networking site's inception in 2004. First there was Eduardo Saverin, the company's chief financial officer and business manager. Brazilian-born Saverin met Zuckerberg at Harvard and invested around $15,000 of personal wealth in the project. He claims Zuckerberg later tried to secretly dilute his share in the company (see the clip below). Saverin filed a law suit against , which was settled out of court and a non-disclosure contract signed. And, of course, there were the Winklevoss twins who founded the Harvard social networking site ConnectU while they were students with Zuckerberg. They claim he stole the idea for Facebook from them and, in 2004, the brothers also filed a law suit against Facebook, winning an estimated $65m. The various spats in Facebook's comparatively short history are portrayed in the film The Social Network, which Zuckerberg apparently still refuses to watch."
1412	1413	Google will be happy with media anger over 'right to be forgotten' 	"The ""right to be forgotten"" has created a right old headache for Google and for publishers alike. As a result of a European court ruling, people can request results relating to them to be removed from Google's searches – even if the original article is true, fair and accurate – if it is ""outdated"" or ""irrelevant"". says it has received at least 70,000 such requests. So far, six Guardian articles, at least one BBC article and several Mail Online pieces , we learned on Thursday, as the publishers received automated notifications that their work had been partially delisted. There has been no small degree of confusion as to what this actually means. Firstly, no web page disappears from the internet as a result of this: the articles are still present, but may become much harder to find because Google removes the offending article from search results for the complainant's name. So to give a hypothetical example, if the Guardian ran a story about a John Doe running an illegal kitten farm in Surrey, and years later he complained to Google, the article may be removed from search results for ""John Doe"", but could still appear in results for ""illegal kitten sanctuary Surrey"". This can have some strange effects: the ""disappeared"" article related to Stan O'Neal, former boss of Merrill Lynch. However, it seems O'Neal was not the person who complained about the article, which still appears in results for his name; instead the complaint came from someone who commented below the piece. This can still be a serious challenge to freedom of expression. ""Outdated"" and ""irrelevant"" are broad terms that lie in the eye of the beholder, especially as the court neglected to give specific definitions of either in its ruling. or Daily Mail might regard a 2005 article about legal tax avoidance as timely and relevant if its subject is still doing business. The subject of the piece is likely to feel differently. The ruling makes Google decide. This gives Google a huge role in policing the internet, and one it really doesn't seem to want: if it tries to resist too many (or any) removals, it could easily end up mired in numerous cases with Europe's information commissioners, taking up huge time and expense for the company. Similarly, though, it doesn't want to be left with thousands of daily requests for manual tweaks of search results. It's convenient, then, that it's found a way to get the media to kick up the fuss for it: there are very few news organisations in the world who are happy to hear their output is being stifled. A few automated messages later, the story is back in the headlines – and Google is likely to be happy about that. Still, just because Google might like changes to the ruling, or how it would work, doesn't mean the rest of us might not also benefit. At stake is the internet's effectiveness as a research tool: do we think the internet is better if people are free to wipe the slate clean, even if they really did everything that was written, or not? Who should get to decide what stays and what goes? The time to decide is drawing very close."
1424	1425	Google admits to errors over Guardian 'right to be forgotten' link deletions 	" has acknowledged that it ""incorrectly"" removed links to several Guardian articles last month and then reinstated them after complaints from people citing the ""right to be forgotten"". Following a European court ruling, Google is required to remove links to ""inadequate, irrelevent or … excessive"" information from its search results in EU countries if the person to which the web page relates places a complaint, subject to a public interest test. But in a comment piece in the Guardian, Google's chief legal officer, David Drummond, acknowledged that the company, which opposes the ruling, was still working out the right way to implement the judgment, and had made some errors. The Guardian was one of the first outlets to be notified that some of its content had been removed from some EU search results, receiving six notification that articles had been affected. Four of those articles were subsequently reinstated into search results by Google. If complainants wish to challenge reinstatements they must do so through their country's information commissioner's office. Drummond said Google disagreed with the ruling, but said the company respected ""the court's authority"" and was ""doing its very best to comply quickly and responsibly"". He promised the public debate would affect how the company made its decisions on removing or reinstating content for the 250,000 requests it had received from more than 70,000 people. ""Of course, only two months in, our process is still very much a work in progress,"" he wrote. ""It's why we incorrectly removed links to an article last week (since been reinstated). But the good news is that the ongoing, active, debate that's happening will inform the development of our principles, policies and practices, in particular about how to balance one person's right to privacy with another's right to know."" Drummond also announced that Google had set up an advisory council of experts to examine the ""right to be forgotten"" issue. Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia founder and internet campaigner, will sit on the panel, as will Le Monde's editorial director, Sylvie Kauffmann, and the UN special rapporteur Frank La  Rue. The advisory council would take evidence from appropriate bodies and interest groups, as well as hold public meetings, Drummond said. It would produce a public report on some of the more difficult points concerning the ""right to be forgotten"", including issues about spent criminal convictions and victims of abuse, as well as the wider societal implications of the court's ruling."
1427	1428	Tesco revamp looks to stop giant stores becoming a white elephant 	"Bigger is no longer better – at least for supermarkets. After more than two decades of opening ever larger stores, shopping habits are changing fast and supermarket bosses are having to hastily rethink their business model. They are chopping back the size of their largest stores as shoppers start to buy less, but more frequently and locally, and as traditional retailers face increasing competition from the internet. Next week shoppers will get an idea of what might be in store for them when reopens its Watford hypermarket, with a whole array of new ideas designed to pull in families for more than just the weekly shop. The Watford Extra shop, initially opened in 1988, will feature the first Giraffe restaurant outlet inside a Tesco – the grocer bought the chain in March for £49m – along with a nail salon and a ""community space"" for local groups to use. There will also be a branch of Harris & Hoole, the coffee shop chain backed by the grocer and a Euphorium artisan bakery. At the vast Stockton-on-Tees branch Tesco is installing a soft-play zone and a gym which will offer pilates classes. In Coventry Tesco is testing out a new carvery restaurant called Decks that will serve up roast dinners for £5.50. Sports Direct outlets could also soon be springing up inside Tesco stores: the grocer is in talks to rent space to the sportswear chain. It has already the sliced nearly 40% off one hypermarket in the Czech Republic by renting the space to Sports Direct and C&A. The move increased the number of visitors by 25% and trading profits rose by £0.5m. Tesco's UK boss Chris Bush told The Grocer magazine last week: ""In the past, large hypermarkets were popular because they offered a massive range of products and people liked being able to buy everything under one roof – it made life easier. The internet has changed all that – people don't even need to leave their homes to go shopping and more people are using convenience stores for regular top-up shops. So we need to give them good reasons to come to our larger stores."" His view of superstores now is not one where shoppers wheel their trolleys down aisles filled entirely with giant bottles of Coke or electrical goods but as destinations where ""customers can have a meal or coffee with their friends and family, browse for clothes and get their hair done. They can go to yoga classes or attend cookery classes in a space available for the local community to use."" Tesco called an end to the supermarket ""space race"" a year ago, saying it was ditching its long-term plan of opening ever larger stores across the country. It is also hacking back the size of up to 50 of its biggest UK supermarkets. A further 20 stores in central Europe, some of which are as big as 14,000 sq metres (150,000 sq ft), also face a prune. Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive says that the company is unlikely to open any more stores over 7,500 sq metres in future, and all its existing stores over that size are likely to change markedly. Industry insiders have said it was probably a mistake for any supermarket to open stores over 5,500-6,500 sq metres – suggesting the pruning job could be bigger than Clarke is so far ready to admit. Tesco is the first to admit that it needs to take drastic action to slim down its massive shops. But there are at least 137 other UK supermarkets over 5,500 sq metres, on top of the 238 Tesco owns in the UK, suggesting others may have to follow suit in future. ""This could be just the beginning,"" says Dave McCarthy, retail analyst at Investec. ""I think there will be a lot more over time."" The large store is not just a UK phenomenon. Retailers such as in the US and Carrefour in Europe are all trying to work out how to prevent their giant stores becoming white elephants. Once the bright shiny face of the future, shoppers have fallen out of love with huge supermarkets. With the dawn of the internet, it's more convenient, and often cheaper, to buy large non-food items such as TVs and sofas from home. Rising petrol prices mean that driving to out of town stores is more expensive and those trying to watch their budget are choosing to shop more frequently, and more locally, rather than risk the temptations on offer at a hypermarket. Meanwhile, buying groceries online is increasingly attractive, particularly now it's possible to pick them up at a convenient time via click-and-collect services. While there is mounting concern about the decline of the UK's town centres, out-of-town stores have been witnessing a much bigger drop in visitor numbers. In the early months of this year, according to the British Retail Consortium/Springboard footfall monitor, the number of out-of-town shoppers fell 4.3%, compared to a 2.9% drop on the high street. With fewer visitors, large stores can seem dreary and cavernous. As Tesco's chief executive Phil Clarke told analysts: ""The worst thing is going into a store which is short on customers and big on space."" What's more, huge stores are just no longer cost effective. Tesco and its rivals earn little profit from selling electronics, CDs or DVDs, while the space needed to display them needs heating, lighting and staff. Asda boss Andy Clarke has said he wants to work with well-known local independent outlets, such as butchers and bakers, to create more life and colour in stores. The US-owned chain already has branches of McDonald's and Disney concessions in some stores and plans to do more such ventures. Asda has also tried letting community groups use spare space for dance lessons and scout groups and even hosted a driving test centre and provided rooms for midwives and police officers. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, says: ""It is premature to say that hypermarkets are dead but they are having to evolve to remain relevant. In five years time they will look very different."""
1428	1429	UK services data points to 1%-plus GDP growth in fourth quarter 	"Britain's recovery appears to be accelerating, with GDP growth likely to be above 1% in the final quarter of 2013, according to the latest survey of the key services sector. The monthly Purchasing Managers' Index stood at 60 in November. That was the weakest reading in five months, but still pointed to a robust pace of growth. Chris Williamson, of data provider Markit, which compiles the survey, said that together with strong readings from both manufacturing and construction, the services PMI was signalling faster GDP growth in the final three months of 2013 than the 0.8% rise recorded in the third quarter. ""Further buoyant growth of the services economy hands the chancellor a further piece of good news ahead of the autumn statement. When looked at alongside the upturns in the buoyant manufacturing and construction sectors, the three PMI surveys indicate that the pace of economic growth will have accelerated in the fourth quarter, rising to above 1%,"" he said. Services firms also reported that backlogs of work had increased for an eighth successive month, and they had taken on new recruits to try to keep up with demand. Businesses said the pickup in the housing market was helping to boost demand. However, there was also worrying evidence in the survey that inflation pressures may be picking up. This will concern the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which is watching closely to see how rapidly the economy can expand without generating upward pressures on prices. ""Input costs"" – the price of raw materials and other business costs – rose at their fastest rate for nine months, according to Markit. The chancellor will deliver his autumn statement on Thursday, and is expected to announce that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has substantially upgraded its growth forecasts for this year and next."
1429	1430	Microsoft co-founder lays bare his battles with Bill Gates 	"Bill Gates betrayed his ailing business partner and tried to deprive him of his share of the Microsoft fortune, according to a scathing memoir from , the company's billionaire co-founder. Allen portrays the Microsoft mogul as a sarcastic bully who tried to force his founding partner out of the firm and to cut his share in the company as he was recovering from cancer. The book, Idea Man: a Memoir by the co-founder of Microsoft, is set to go on sale on 17 April, and an extract appears in May's Vanity Fair magazine and . Despite Gates's moves, Allen held on to his stake – one that contributed to the lion's share of what Forbes magazine's estimates to be a $13bn (£8.1bn) fortune. The two were once inseparable and met at Lakeside high school in Seattle where Allen paints a picture of the couple as the original nerds. Allen didn't fit in amid the golfers and tennis players ""who carried their rackets wherever they went"". Then in 1968 he met Gates, another gawky kid who was also spending all his free time hunched over the school's first computer, an . ""His blond hair went all over the place. You could tell three things about pretty quickly. He was really smart. He was really competitive; he wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent."" At the age of 13 Gates was already poring over Fortune magazine and planning on building a company. When Gates went to Harvard, Allen followed him and the two spent their spare time working on ideas for a software firm. ""I'd assumed that our partnership would be a 50-50 proposition. But Bill had another idea,"" Allen writes. Gates had put in more work than Allen, and eventually after some quibbling from Gates, Allen agreed to a 64-36 split. Allen writes that when the relationship soured he wondered again about that split. ""I'd been taught that a deal was a deal and your word was your bond. Bill was more flexible,"" he writes. Gates pushed deals ""as hard and as far as he could"". Relations worsened as Microsoft took off. Gates would prowl the car park to see who came in on the weekend. He thrived on conflict and sarcasm; he and Allen would argue for hours at a stretch. Then Gates brought in , the firm's current boss, to help manage the company. Gates offered Ballmer 8.75% of the firm, angering other staff and Allen, who had agreed to a far smaller percentage. In 1982 Allen contracted Hodgkin's lymphoma. When he returned to work relations with Gates and Ballmer hit a new low. Allen claims the pair undermined him and he overheard them discussing ways of diluting his stake in the firm. ""Unable to stand it any longer, I burst in on them and shouted, 'This is unbelievable! It shows your true character, once and for all,'"" he writes. Ballmer and Gates later apologised but the partnership was over. Allen resigned and Gates tried to buy him out for $5 a share. Allen refused and said he wouldn't discuss less than $10. Gates balked at the price and Allen left with what was to become an enormous fortune. Shares are trading at more than $25 and the company is now worth more than $214bn. ""While my recollection of many of these events may differ from Paul's, I value his friendship and the important contributions he made to the world of technology and at Microsoft,"" Gates said in a written statement given to the Wall Street Journal."
1432	1433	Apple awarded more than $1bn in Samsung patent infringement trial 	"Apple has been awarded more than $1bn (£632m) in damages after its rival smartphone and tablet manufacturer was found to have copied critical features of its iPhone and iPad. The US jury stunned observers by returning a decision after just two and a half days' deliberation following four weeks of legal argument. The jurors rejected every single one of the South Korean company's patent claims, and backed Apple's claim that Samsung had breached US antitrust laws by trying to keep its wireless patents as a monopoly. The decision means that Apple has gained a major weapon in its fight against Samsung, which is the biggest maker of smartphones and mobile phones in the world, and the biggest of the handset makers. The verdict will also be a key platform in Apple's ongoing court battles with other Android smartphone companies, including HTC and Motorola. Samsung and Apple have been at war through the courts since April 2011, when Apple filed a suit in the US alleging that a number of Samsung smartphones and tablets used some of its patented technologies – such as the ""rubber band"" effect when scrolling a long list of items – and mimicked its ""trade dress"", the general cosmetic appearance of its and iPad, in a way that could confuse potential customers. On Friday Samsung issued a statement saying: ""Today's verdict should not be viewed as a win for , but as a loss for the American consumer. It will lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices. It is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners, or technology that is being improved every day by Samsung and other companies. ""Consumers have the right to choices, and they know what they are buying when they purchase Samsung products. This is not the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world, some of which have already rejected many of Apple's claims. Samsung will continue to innovate and offer choices for the consumer."" Apple's founder, Steve Jobs, kicked off the battle, telling his biographer Walter Isaacson that he would go ""thermonuclear"" in his battle against Android . That started with HTC's implementation in 2010 of Android. ""I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40bn in the bank, to right this wrong,"" Jobs told Isaacson. ""I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."" An attempted peace pact between Jobs and Eric Schmidt, then Google's chief executive, came to nothing. But Apple's war against Google has been indirect — targeting the handset makers that use Android rather than the search giant which writes the software itself. Evidence of Jobs's antipathy to Android was excluded from the evidence heard in court. Samsung, in this case, responded that Apple had used its patented technology for 3G wireless connectivity without permission, and that it used some of its patented methods, such as sending photos from a camera-equipped phone. Those claims were rejected by the jury. Samsung had also insisted that Apple's technology patents were invalid because of previous inventions by rival firms, which it demonstrated in the court. It said that the ""trade dress"" claims were nonsensical, and that customers were not confused. An area of relief for Samsung was that the jury decided its Galaxy tablets did not look so much like the as to breach ""trade dress"". But they hit it with a billion-dollar damages decision for infringing Apple's ""utility"" patents on its behaviour. Samsung is expected to appeal to a higher court. But the victory for Apple is a publicity coup as the battle for control of the smartphone and tablet market intensifies ahead of the Christmas period — during which Apple is expected to have a new iPhone on release, and possibly a new, smaller version of the iPad. Apple and Samsung are suing each other in more than 30 cases around the world in Europe, Australia and the US. Apple, based in Cupertino — just 10 miles from the San Jose court where lawyers for the two sides made their case — is fighting multiple cases against rival smartphone makers which use Google's Android software, including Samsung, HTC and Motorola — the latter now owned by Google. The decision is a critical blow in the smartphone wars now going on around the world between Apple and Samsung, and by proxy between Apple and other makers of smartphones using Google's Android software. Samsung is the biggest mobile, smartphone and Android mobile company — meaning that this decision will resound throughout the industry. Reaching a decision had looked like a labyrinthine process. Judge Lucy Koh's instructions on how to decide ran to 109 pages and took over two hours to read out after the two companies had spent four weeks arguing in court. The jury then had to negotiate a verdict paper consisting of 20 pages with 33 questions which offered, in total, about 700 options – although it all boiled down to four: were Apple's claimed patents infringed and if so how much was it owed? And: were Samsung's claimed patents infringed, and if so how much was it owed? Yet they reached their verdict after barely two days' deliberation, surprising legal experts who had thought that the decision could take weeks. The jury for the high-profile trial in which Oracle sued Google alleging that the Android mobile operating system infringed its patents. The jury then took two weeks to reach a verdict that largely exonerated Google. Apple brought a high-profile array of executives to testify including Phil Schiller, its longtime head of marketing, and Scott Forstall, who heads its iPhone and iPad software division. Apple also showed prototypes of the iPhone and iPad dating back to 2003, as well as an internal Samsung document comparing the iPhone's behaviour with that of Samsung's smartphone, which described the difference as ""Heaven and Earth"" and noted hundreds of items of difference where Samsung needed to improve. The jury of seven men and two women, all from California, included four who have worked for technology companies including chipmaker Intel and phone business AT&T, and two engineers. . Five are over 50; three were born outside the US – one in India and two in the Philippines. The result came just hours after a South Korean court had ruled against both Apple and Samsung, deciding that they had each infringed each others' patents. Both were fined and told to take some of their products off the shelves in that country."
1436	1437	Minecraft: how a change to the rules is tearing the community apart 	"For the past few years, Gregory Bylos has been doing pretty well out of Minecraft. His company, Mineplex, runs a server network for fans of the massively successful construction game. As well as giving players all over the globe the chance to build in the same worlds together, Bylos and his staff have developed a range of custom Minecraft modes, challenges and maps. Here, you can play things like Castle Siege, which turns Minecraft into a full-on fantasy war game, or Super Smash Mobs, which re-creates the Nintendo fighting game series Super Smash Bros – but in . It's immensely popular. Over one million people a month come to Mineplex to experience the company's modifications and community features. ""Almost 25 percent of all Minecraft accounts ever bought have played on Mineplex alone in the last eight months,"" says Bylos. That's a lot: there are 100m registered users, over 14m sales on PCs. But there's a problem. Mineplex, like hundreds of other Minecraft server providers, may be breaking the End User License Agreement (EULA) provided by the game's developer, Mojang. Now the previously benign Swedish studio is putting its foot down, and a fissure has opened up across the once peaceful Minecraft community. The trouble started on Thursday 12 June when , responding to some about the extent to which server companies could monetise their custom Minecraft content and services. Mojang spokesperson Owen Hill explained that server providers could accept donations from players, as long as these payments were not exchanged for items or power-ups that would give players advantages in the game world. He also stated that servers could charge players for entry, and for personalisation items like cool hats and silly pets, but could not charge for items that would affect gameplay, such as powerful swords or potions. In short, Mojang wanted to prevent servers from offering players a ""pay to win"" model to customers. But the server providers balked – and a Twitter storm ensued. With days, there was a hash tag #saveminecraft, which would be seen by over 500,000 users. There were dozens of unfavourable comparisons between Mojang and monolithic video game publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision, the latter often criticised online for their highly restrictive digital rights management and user license agreements. The grievance many Minecraft fans had was simple: although these terms had always been present in Mojang's Minecraft EULA, they had never been enforced over the three years since the game's launch. Mojang had always fostered a sensibility; it had pushed Minecraft as an open platform, freely customisable by both players and server providers. But now it was tightening the leash. And . My friends and other good willing server owners will lose their jobs because of a few rotten eggs in the community! Two days after the announcement, Marcus 'Notch' Persson, creator of Minecraft and founder of Mojang, to defend his company's stance. ""Some privately run Minecraft servers do charge for in-game items, for xp boosts, for access to certain game modes,"" he wrote. ""Some of them even charge quite a lot. I don’t even know how many emails we’ve gotten from parents, asking for the hundred dollars back [that] their kid spent on an item pack on a server we have no control over. This was never allowed, but we didn’t crack down on it because we’re constantly incredibly swamped in other work."" The problem is that while there are no doubt dozens of Minecraft server providers who just want to make money from charging players to acquire advantageous in-game items (and Mojang is surely right to crack down on them), there are plenty who claim they offer a more nuanced service. The likes of Mineplex, Hypixel and The Hive all run competitive player-vs-player matches in which participants can pay for ""ranks"", essentially packages of in-game abilities, such as speedier movement, better armour, or a wider range of magical potions. But these ranks are balanced so that none has a clear advantage over each other – they're just different. ""For instance, one of our games focuses on small free-for-all matches between four players,"" says Bylos. ""Each player chooses a Minecraft character to play as, and all kits are balanced with pros and cons – so a character that can do more damage may be slower, whereas a character that can fly short distances may have weaker damage."" This model is very common in multiplayer online titles, including the hugely successful team-based battle game League of Legends, where players purchase different classes of character, each with different strengths and weaknesses. In an , Bylos argued that Mojang was making the business model untenable for large server providers such as Multiplex, with large staff and infrastructure overheads. ""I personally discussed our rank system with a member of your business team at Minecon last year and he confirmed we were in compliance with the EULA,"" Bylos wrote. ""The only rule was to not sell Mojang IP (ie. access to a diamond sword), which none of the large networks do."" For many in the Minecraft server business, Mojang is attempting to crack a nut with a diamond sledgehammer. Delyth Angharad runs a small family-friendly server called Minesquish and finances it with straightforward donations, but she understands the grievances of the bigger sites. ""Mojang's main goal with the EULA rules is to prevent unfair extortion and situations like a player-vs-player (PVP) server charging a few hundred bucks for a diamond armour kit,"" she says. ""That is fair, but under those rules, they're also preventing more balanced monetisation strategies."" Bylos sees the services provided by the server companies as an essential element of the Minecraft ecosystem. While many fans are happy to keep playing the basic ""vanilla"" Minecraft, many others like the custom modes and maps that Mineplex, Hypixel, and so on create and run. ""I think Mojang does recognise the value we are bringing to their player community,"" he says. ""Last year at Minecon we were described as the 'second tier of content', and that's really where we see ourselves. The top servers see more than a million unique players every month, and there are thousands of smaller servers beyond that. It would be hard to make an argument that we are not helping to keep players engaged and interested in Minecraft."" But there is another wrinkle in this whole argument. In May, Mojang launched , a service allowing PC and Mac owners to set up their own private servers for up to 20 friends. The service costs £8 a month and is being touted as ""the easiest way for you to host a Minecraft world online."" Some members of the Minecraft server community suspect that Mojang's EULA enforcement, coming just a month after the Realms release, is a way to drive users toward its own product. written by server provider Towncraft states: If this EULA clarification was really about protecting players, Mojang would have stepped in against “pay-to-win” servers a long time before their Minecraft Realms service popped on the scene [...] Mark my words… Mojang can only sell so many copies of Minecraft before they need to find another way to monetize it. Realms was just a start. Mojang's Nathan Adams has , suggesting that there is no comparison between a service that provides small groups of friends with a private server, and a larger business that provides custom content, maps and mini-games. However, as within any online games community, conspiracy theories are rife, and many feel that Realms is a Trojan horse for a more ambitious multiplayer offering from Mojang – one that would directly compete with Mineplex et al. So what happens now? We asked Mojang for comment, but the company did not get back to us. It has given server provides until 1 August to comply with the EULA and remove features that charge players for skill items and ranks – however balanced they may be. Some server providers are questioning whether Mojang has any legal right to enforce the user agreements after several years of not paying attention. According to Jas Purewal, founder of interactive entertainment law firm Purewal & Partner, there is no time limit on EULA enforcement, ""like any contract, they can in theory become more difficult to enforce if there is a lengthy gap between the contract starting and the enforcement beginning, or if the developer says they won’t enforce their rights and then changes their mind after the game buyer has relied on that claim in some concrete way – in the UK, US and other common law countries this is called ‘ ’. Whether those arguments could be deployed successfully against the game developer depends very heavily on the detailed facts and circumstances of what was actually said and done and when."" It's likely that the server providers will comply with the refreshed EULA rulings, but there are concerns that the nature of these custom communities will change forever. The owner of the Stompzcraft server has even made a video outlining his concerns: ""At this point, we're examining our options and trying to get Mojang to discuss the issues they're facing and how we can help contribute to a solution that may be less damaging to the current multiplayer servers,"" says Bylos. "" I do think we will survive it, but I think it will have a significant cost in terms of player experience. I know of a few major servers that are already putting ambitious projects on hold or canceling them altogether because of the new guidelines."" ""The lead developer of the Shotbow Network had a particularly insightful comment a few days ago: 'I can only hope that Mojang listens to their community that loves them (a little too much) and trades out the sledgehammer for a scalpel.'"" Mojang has got in touch and referred us to . Here, the Minecraft creator gives a spirited and fair defence of the EULA enforcement, which he says is directed at servers offering pay-to-win content and at companies attempting to mix in-game and real-world currencies. He argues that the previous EULA was restrictive, but is steadfast that ""ranks"" and ""kits"" are ways to pay for progress and therefore not allowed – whatever they may (or may not) add to the experience. ""Diversity is not a goal in and of itself,"" he states. ""These rules definitely remove the option to sell powerups for your character, which is a limitation of diversity, but I consider that a very good thing. I feel bad for the people who have built businesses around this, though."" "
1437	1438	How Minecraft has bewitched 40 million of us 	" funny thing happened on the way to this column. Browsing idly through the site, I came on the list of the . The Top 20 list was dominated by ""young adult"" fiction, books such as by Veronica Roth and John Green's plus the usual movie tie-ins. At No 9 ,there's a religious book, by missionary Sarah Young. At No 11 is (""A little boy's astounding story of his trip to Heaven and back""). Two slots further down there's a ""junior novelisation"" of the Disney film, . At No 15 is an ""activity book"", complete with 50 stickers, based on the same film. At this point, your columnist was losing the will to live. Is this, he wondered, what a free society really chooses to read? But what's this? At 16 and 17 there are two computer game manuals – and . The only people in your household who will be astonished that two computer game manuals are selling like hot cakes are the adults. This is because they don't know what every child from the age of six upwards knows, namely that is the most absorbing and intriguing gaming idea since David Braben and Ian Bell created in 1984. What's even more astonishing (for adults anyway) is that has none of the CGI faux-realism of the blockbuster computer games marketed by Electronic Arts et al. Players are not compelled to act out the crazed, violent, misogynistic scripts dreamed up for them by programmers working for multimedia conglomerates. In , there's no realism and no script. Instead, you find yourself in a virtual world made of 1x1 blocks. The analogy with Lego is unmistakable, but the Lego corporation had nothing to do with . The virtual world has mountains, valleys, lakes and clouds, but the version of it in which you find yourself is uniquely yours – it's generated by an algorithm. And you are dropped into it with no instructions. So you spend the first few hours simply exploring it as a virtual tourist. And you find that you can do things with blocks, such as build a wall or make a cave. But then you notice that the light fading (a days lasts only 20 real-time minutes) and all of a sudden you are transformed from blithe tourist into frightened rabbit. Because in the night is full of horrors – spiders, skeletons, zombies and camouflaged creepers, all of which have an eerie ability to pursue you relentlessly and remorselessly. And the only way to stay safe is to build yourself some kind of shelter or dig out a cave in which to wait out the hours of darkness. With experience, you figure out ways of coping. You learn how to build elaborate structures and acquire skills that enable you to fashion weapons with which to combat the terrors of the night. And you can build anything you like, as long as it can be made out of blocks, which means that some people have built replicas of the Taj Mahal. Again, the analogy with Lego is compelling. What happens if you don't know how to build something? Answer: go to YouTube and type ""Minecraft how to build…"" And at this point you begin to appreciate the extent of the phenomenon, because the number of people who have proudly explained in video how they constructed this or that in the game is staggering. But the most implausible thing of all is that this ostensibly simplistic and unrealistic game currently has more than 40 million players worldwide, many of whom are fanatical in their devotion to it. And it was created not by some large multimedia corporation but by a single Swedish programmer, , who has made hundreds of millions of dollars from it, and who is regarded by players with the kind of awed respect that Linus Torvalds is accorded by users of the Linux operating system. The phenomenon runs counter to almost every trend in the contemporary computing industry, which is towards the kind of consumer lock-in and corporate control that we see in the ""normal"" games industry, in which teenagers frenziedly play a new game for a few weeks and then drop it. And perhaps therein lies the secret of 's attraction: it's . Players' possibilities are bounded only by the limits of their imaginations – or by the limits of their knowledge. Which perhaps explains those book sales."
1445	1446	Right to be forgotten: Wikipedia chief enters internet censorship row 	"Internet search engines such as Google should not be left in charge of ""censoring history"", the founder has said, after the US firm revealed it had approved half of more than 90,000 ""right to be forgotten"" requests. said it was dangerous to have companies decide what should and should not be allowed to appear on the internet. His comments came after the bosses of the leading search engines met the heads of European data watchdogs on Thursday. has been at the centre of a censorship row since the European courts ruled that people should have the right to request that ""irrelevant"" personal information about them is removed from search results. Since May, the firm has received 90,000 requests for links to be removed, relating to more than 300,000 pages. More than half of these requests have been approved, it told European data watchdogs. The authorities have been concerned that the Google has been notifying the owners of pages that are delisted, which led in one case to a person being written about again by the Wall Street Journal. Google initially made it known that a paedophile, politician and doctor were among the initial removal requests, but has since acknowledged there are some more compelling claims. Wales's position was backed by Rohan Silva, a tech entrepreneur and former adviser to David Cameron, who tweeted that it was ""good to hear (Wales) fighting the good fight against internet censorship"". But the Labour MEP Claude Moraes accused Google of failing to implement the EU ruling properly. He also said the firm was not mentioning the fact that data supervisory authorities were the final arbiters in disputed cases and it was not junior staff making decisions on such issues. Christopher Graham, the UK information commissioner, said some of Google's concerns were overblown. ""Google is a massive commercial organisation making millions and millions out of processing people's personal information. They're going to have to do some tidying up,"" he told BBC Radio 5's Wake Up to Money on Thursday. ""All this talk about rewriting history and airbrushing embarrassing bits from your past – this is nonsense, that's not going to happen. There will certainly be occasions when there ought to be less prominence given to things that are done and dusted, over and done with. The law would regard that as a spent conviction, but so far as Google is concerned there's no such thing as a spent conviction."""
1446	1447	A manifesto for the future of the 'right to be forgotten' debate 	or more than two months now, the inaptly-named “right to be forgotten” has remained buoyant in the news cycle. The reasons are as complex as the distortions, but distinctly missing from the discourse is critical engagement with the foundations and implications of the European data protection regime that gave flight to the discussion. Also missing is an exploration of the proposed course of action by and other players engaged in implementation, and an assessment of how those responses could be strengthened and improved. The – the advisory association of European data protection authorities that ought to be at the helm of navigating solutions – has Google and other search engines to a meeting in Brussels on 24 July to discuss the ruling and its concerns. This is a welcome though belated move, but what is required is a thorough discussion of what is possible: proactive, not reactive. On 13 May, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) that, in some circumstances –notably, where personal information online is inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive in relation to – links should be removed from Google’s search index. A Spanish lawyer, Mario Costeja González, was concerned that Google searches on his name prominently featured two foreclosure notices published under legal requirement in 1998, when his home was repossessed for debt. The Spanish data protection authority rejected his claim to remove the original archived notices, but asked Google to remove referring links from its index. Google appealed, and the Spanish court requested guidance from the ECJ. The ECJ accepted Mr Costeja’s claim that indexing the notices was irrelevant to Google’s purposes as a search engine under the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive, triggering an international discussion on the availability and accessibility of information online. The ECJ’s ruling was unexpected. Contrary to the of Advocate General Niilo Jääskinen, Google was found to be a European data controller with associated responsibilities. More controversially, by allowing the deletion of links in this case, the ECJ opened the gamut to a challenging regulatory debate about privacy, freedom of expression, and access to legally-published information, not to mention complex questions associated with implementation. The result is a watershed in the evolution of the – the informational environment represented by our increasingly hyperconnected world. So what were the foundations of the ruling, and what strategies might be considered in formulating a suitable response? The ECJ’s ruling has been labelled the ‘right to be forgotten’ – an unfortunate and polarising catchphrase that inadequately reflects its legal origins and practical effect. Legally, Mr Costeja’s right is just one facet of his individual privacy rights derived from the EU Data Protection Directive and the European Convention on Human Rights. Privacy rights inevitably involve boundary problems as they come into conflict with rights to freedom of expression and access to information. These rights are not absolute; fair balance is required. In this context, and against the current default, the ECJ strongly emphasised the importance of individual privacy interests in otherwise privatised, economically-driven digital curation and navigation, recognising the ubiquity of digital information and the ever-increasing influence of search engines and other intermediaries in shaping who we are and what we do online. The ECJ’s ruling appealed at base to deeply-held of autonomy, forgiveness, and closure. It correctly recognised that, in physical (offline), virtual (online), and increasingly hybrid (or ‘onlife’) spaces, we must afford one another the possibility to make mistakes, to restart, and to move on. However, ‘to forget’ is a misleading label, and the vague interpretation that the court gave to the notion of relevance – which is always relative to changing interests – is unsatisfactory. Although current data protection law precludes such a course, a better ground might be to consider a clearly identifiable reference to whether information is harmful, prejudicial, or exclusively personal. Neither the taxonomy (‘right to be forgotten’) nor the logic (relevance determined by age as justification for support) truly addresses the broader need for information sedimentation – solutions, to the infosphere, that enable us, individually and as a society, to ; to live with, but also beyond, experience; to acknowledge without constraining. There is understandable discomfort concerning implementation of this ruling by Google and other intermediaries. It applies to 500 million European citizens whose data are strewn across billions of webpages. When Google first responded with an allowing individuals to identify “irrelevant, outdated, or otherwise inappropriate” links, apparently 40,000 claims were made within the first six days, with another 30,000 in the month following. The risk is that, in order to manage the interests recognised in the ruling at scale, powerful but blunt tools may be deployed. Such tools, it is feared, may serve the interests of disinformation, rather than better information and more social cohesion. Nevertheless, it is unhelpful to claim that the ruling invites censorship. These criticisms fail to engage with the interests at stake or to consider creative solutions. It must be recalled, prosaically, that the search industry is a business. There are already well-established practices in reputation management and search result optimisation that customise online information delivery. The crucial challenge is how to achieve appropriate information sedimentation inside the infosphere. So far, there have been few public details on the procedures being applied by Google and other intermediaries to deal with requests in response to the ruling. While the haste and seriousness of efforts to comply must be lauded, caution must be applied to ensure that any solutions adequately address both individuals’ interests in information concerning them, and the public interest in useful information curation. Here are five strategies worth testing. Currently, Google’s complaint form has an unconstrained 1,000-character input box. It could become more useful by structuring inputs according to how different types of information may be treated, with a hierarchy based on the seriousness of the privacy intervention. Costeja’s case is just one amidst the considerable experience that national data protection authorities have accumulated, tasked with balancing personal data protection rights against the public interest. Google could work with these authorities, other data controllers, academics, and practitioners to aggregate past cases, guidelines, and experience, in order to chart the contours of individual interests that data protection law must respect, and to integrate that knowledge with the growing volume of new requests. This will allow the refinement of tools and policies that can be applied consistently and respectfully, by private or public data controllers alike, in a way that is transparent to the public. It would be better for the infosphere, and individuals’ experiences within it, if Google’s solutions could integrate with those developed by other search engines and information aggregators, from Bing and Yahoo, to Twitter and Facebook, and if those solutions could be unconstrained regionally (currently anyone can access information that has been ‘forgotten’ by simply using a search engine not based in the EU). If a is pursued, it could also provide options for smaller, less-resourced intermediaries, ensuring that when individuals operate across multiple platforms, there is some institutional memory and coordination to prevent either under- or over-determination of individual requests. The online form creates collateral problems in collecting identifying information, and in relying on individuals to identify and bring information to the attention of search engines. Not every user has the awareness, skills, and resources to monitor his or her information online, so we must be conscious of usability issues, particularly (though this is not the case at the moment) in view of a possible future expectation that the presence, rather than absence, of damaging information is a matter of choice. Empowering users with a self-filled form is undoubtedly an improvement, but it should be accompanied by an exploration of proactive responsibilities for information quality control by other agents in the infosphere. The fruitful synthesis of decided cases and new claims will help to focus the technical expertise of Google and other search engines. Individuals should be able to assess readily – ideally, through a simple online tool – whether personal information that they notify to a data controller will be dealt with in an automated fashion or by applying human discretion. In both cases, the principles and guidelines being applied should be made clear. There has been considerable speculation regarding whether Google will issue individual take-down notices, as is presently done for copyright-infringing material, or otherwise notify the public (eg. via the original publisher) that information has been removed. While there is certainly a need for transparency, this can be done more successfully via the three mechanisms described above – in an aggregated and de-identified manner – than by highlighting individual cases. Issuing individual notices may create speculation and attention that could be more damaging than the information was in the first place, undermining information sedimentation. It is appropriate that notices should be sent to webmasters so there is an opportunity for independent assessment of the merits of a case and for archival purposes. However, it is not appropriate for those notifications to then be republished in identified form to the public at large or to appear on a website such as , which would likely cause unwanted damage or distress, potentially in breach of . There are many alternative technical possibilities to de-indexing, including reordering information results, de-identifying information, and appending additional qualifying information. In particular, where possible, the capacity to tag information at scale could be very useful, since it would also improve the quality of the infosphere. One of the problems with search, and with the infosphere more generally, is that the popularity of some information is not a good reflection of its truthfulness or utility. Instead of an all-or-nothing approach, internet services could be encouraged to consider a generally-available right to comment – for example, by linking metadata to alternative URLs that clarify, update, or contextualise. This would retain an important element of transparency, and could be effectively deployed alongside a more limited right to removal. The problem is the conflict between information and disinformation – particularly, in preventing overburdening web interfaces and search results with augmented content. Here, the expertise of Wikipedia’s Jimmy Wales, who has been co-opted to advise Google on this ruling, will be invaluable. There is now considerable experience in crowdsourcing, community standards, and endorsement, all of which could ensure that tagging of search results produces an information experience of higher quality, usability, and reliability, which is at the same time respectful of individuals’ past lives and legal requirements, as well as being technically feasible and economically viable. The more we live in the infosphere, the more natural it will be to take care of it as our informational environment. Although a limited right to comment might be generally warranted, the removal of information is also envisaged by the ruling, and must be addressed. The important distinction here is between the right affirmed by the ECJ – to have a link removed from a search index, ie. on republication – and the right under existing and revised data protection law, which would allow removal at source. These different solutions have different strengths and weaknesses, making them more suitable to some applications than others. They require focus on a uniquely digital issue, which is that the (there and then, e.g., as a printed text in a physical newspaper in an archive) and the (anywhere and anytime, eg., as a link on a search engine online) of information have been decoupled. While the reality and redundancy of digital information, once made broadly accessible, may make it impractical ever to forget completely, we should study ways in which information can be made easier or harder to find, more visible or opaque and, as a result, more useful and less damaging, when required. How we deal with this difficulty requires sensitivity to competing interests, now and in the future, and a full appreciation of legal, social, technical, economic, and ethical considerations. Today, episodes of our lives in the infosphere appear as digital traces across sources beyond our control. As those traces grow ever larger and move towards near complete reflection and inspection of our lives, it is important that we reflect carefully on how this information and its sedimentation can be pro-actively and safely managed. We are, after all, designing the environment in which future generations will spend their lives. It is an extraordinary opportunity and a huge responsibility. We must take both very seriously.

1460	1461	Retailers bank on cyber-shoppers to spend £450m on mega Monday 	"Retailers are hoping that the Mega Monday online shopping spree marked the start of a Christmas rush after industry figures showed disappointing sales in November. Predictions that as much as £450m would have gushed through online tills – making it Britain's busiest day on record for cyber-shopping – have brought comfort to retailers after last month saw sales growth drop to its slowest pace for seven months. In a sign cash-strapped shoppers were putting off festive food buying and holding out for pre-Christmas discounts on gifts, the said November's sales were up just 0.6% on a year earlier once the effect of new store space was stripped out of the figures. It was the weakest performance since takings slumped amid a cold snap in April. Demand for winter and party wear helped sell clothes and a more buoyant housing market saw homewares fare better, but food sales fell for the fourth month running according to the BRC's sales monitor, compiled with accountants KPMG. There was ""good demand"" for festive desserts, party food and Christmas hampers and the ""baking frenzy"" continued, the report said. But consumer confidence weakened and, coupled with falling food prices, knocked sales for the category overall. ""It seems that once again, shoppers are leaving their festive food buying until later. Six in 10 tell us they will spend more time than last year hunting for the best deals, and four in 10 seeking the best quality,"" said Joanne Denney-Finch, chief executive of grocery researcher IGD, which provides the report's food data. Overall, sales growth was ahead of where it was in the runup to Christmas 2012, when November sales rose just 0.4% on the year. The BRC said this November saw a slow start and then growth ""picked up in a big way"" in the final week, when falling temperatures helped boost clothing sales. Helen Dickinson, BRC director general, said: ""Christmas spending looks on course to be an improvement on last year, but December will decide it."" Other reports suggested the make-or-break month for retailers had got off to a strong start. Visa Europe estimated that £450m would have been spent online in 7.7m transactions by the close of business on Monday night, which would make this Mega Monday the busiest online shopping day recorded. Mega Monday is one of many days retailers seek to highlight in the runup to Christmas. It marks the day when shoppers have just been paid for November and, having supposedly spent the weekend browsing, they then splash out online – allowing plenty of time for deliveries in time for Christmas. Retailers mark the day with offers and discounts, following hard on the heels of American import Black Friday – the day US retailers offer post-Thanksgiving discounts. As ever more purchasing moves online the BRC said internet shopping again played a big role in boosting sales in November. Online sales of non-food products grew 16% on a year earlier, the strongest growth so far this year. One in every five pounds of non-food buying was done online last month, the highest proportion on record. Overall, retailers should not bank on a bumper Christmas, economists warn. With inflation still outstripping wage growth and energy bills rising further this winter, many households will be short of money to splash out."
1461	1462	Cost cutting to blame for RBS's Cyber Monday card glitch, says union 	"The boss of RBS has admitted the bank would have to put right decades of underinvestment in its computer systems that have led to embarrassing IT failures barring customers from accessing their accounts. As one City analyst suggested the problems would cost the state-owned bank as much as £1bn to put right, the chief executive, Ross McEwan, apologised for the ""unacceptable"" technical faults. Despite assurances from the bank that the latest problems had been resolved, customers were still reporting problems on Tuesday following Monday's glitch, which saw millions unable to pay by card or withdraw cash on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. The bank said that more than 1,000 branches would open earlyWednesday morning to help customers affected by the faults. McEwan said: ""Monday night's systems failure was unacceptable. It was a busy shopping day and far too many of our customers were let down. ""For decades, RBS failed to invest properly in its systems. We need to put our customers' needs at the centre of all we do. It will take time, but we are investing heavily in building IT systems our customers can rely on. We know we have to do better."" McEwan said he would be announcing plans to improve RBS in the new year, including an outline of how the bank intends to invest in the future. After RBS bought NatWest in 2000 it was lauded for making huge cost savings from combining the two banks' IT systems, but lack of investment has come back to haunt it. Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, said: ""Ross McEwan isn't the first RBS leader to acknowledge there had been an extended period of underinvestment going all the way back to the NatWest deal. I don't think it's wildly inaccurate to imagine RBS spending £1bn over a period of time to put things right, but that isn't a number you will see in any given period."" Union leaders have claimed cost cutting was to blame for the faults on Monday evening and called on the bank to halt its redundancy programme. Unite, Britain's biggest union, said the 30,000 job losses announced by the bailed-out bank since 2008 and the offshoring of IT functions had left it unable to provide a proper service to customers. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: ""It is unacceptable that the bank's customers are once again facing inconvenience. Unite has grave concerns that staffing challenges are exacerbating the problems facing the bank, challenges that could be further amplified when the chief executive announces the outcomes of his strategic review in February. ""Serious questions must be asked as to why constant job cuts are being made when there are clearly serious issues which need addressing by management."" Earlier on Tuesday RBS took to Twitter to apologise to furious customers, promising to compensate those left out of pocket as a result of the failure at RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank, which mainly affected customers between 6.30pm and 9.30pm on Monday. There were reports of trolleys full of shopping abandoned in supermarkets and people unable to pay for their petrol as the bank's customers were unable to withdraw cash and debit cards were declined. Others found that their accounts were overdrawn when there should have been funds available. Typically, about 250,000 RBS customers will use a cash machine every hour. RBS said it would not be compensating customers for inconvenience or time wasted, focusing instead on those who had incurred costs. The bank insisted the issues affecting customers on Monday had been resolved, while conceding that some customers were still having difficulties. A spokesman said: ""The system issues that affected our customers last night have now been resolved and the vast majority of customers are experiencing a good service. We have heard from some customers who are still experiencing problems as our processes and systems get back to a fully normal service. If any customer is experiencing issues they should get in touch with our call centres or come into our branches, where our staff will be ready to help."" Susan Allen, director of customer solutions at RBS, said it was still unclear exactly what went wrong. ""We put all our focus on getting it fixed and we now start the detailed work on what went wrong. It is completely unacceptable that customers couldn't access their own money,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""The investigations would suggest it is completely unrelated to the volumes on Cyber Monday."" Allen insisted the bank would ""put this right for customers"".Some customers were angry about the lack of communication. : ""So nothing on their website or by email about this, until I find out on the Guardian why my card wasn't working. Oh, but you put it on twitter. great."" The failure is a huge embarrassment for RBS, following when IT problems locked many customers out of their accounts for several days. It cost the bank £175m to fix the problem and pay compensation to the customers affected. potentially worth more than £2m as a result of the disruption in June last year. It comes at a low point for RBS amid . City regulators and the bank are investigating the allegations. Data security company Check Point warned RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers to be wary of phishing emails sent to trick them into revealing their full bank details.

Can the designer who introduced the wrap dress into millions of women's wardrobes give Glass the style makeover it needs? “I have always been fascinated by technology and as a brand, DVF embraces technology,” says von Furstenberg, commenting on the collaboration. “It is a very natural fit for us and we are delighted to be on the forefront with Glass.” It's not von Furstenberg's first dalliance with the smartglasses. in New York. Models strutted down the catwalk wearing Glass, recording video footage of the show, while Google co-founder Sergey Brin sat in the front row alongside the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker. Neither is it the first time that Google has attempted to make Glass more stylish - although this is its first collaboration with a fashion designer. This year, it was announced that Google would be teaming up with Ray-Ban maker Luxottica, though the new styles would not be available until 2015. This month, Net-a-Porter will start selling a limited number of the DVF Made for Glass optical and sunglass styles, consisting of five new frame designs and eight new shades. The full collection will go on sale on the . Meanwhile men will be able to choose from three styles within the Titanium collection, which will also go on sale on 23 June on Mr Porter. But the styles don't come cheap. Prescription lenses from the premium collection will set you back $1,725 (£1,026) while sunglasses will cost $1,620 (£964). It was announced in May that a consumer version of Glass is expected to go on sale to the general public at the end of 2014 but . “We are thrilled to offer Glass to our tech-savvy customers who are true leaders and innovators in style and lifestyle,” said Natalie Massenet, founder and chairman of the Net-a-Porter Group, who also expressed excitement in the online retailer bringing Google Glass to their US customers months ahead of the global consumer release. 
1465	1466	AT&T dumps Facebook phone as Home limps past 1m downloads 	" Home, the app intended to turn Android phones into a sort of ""Facebook phone"", is struggling. Having taken almost a month to hit a million downloads from Google's Play store, more than half of the 16,000-odd reviews on the store give it just one star - the lowest grade possible - against 17% offering a 5-star review. Separately, AT&T is reported to be preparing to abandon the Android-based HTC First - also known as the ""Facebook Phone"" - after having last week cut its price from $99 to just 99 cents on the phone which was . Internally, Facebook is understood to be debating how to respond to the poor reception that Home - which was intended to be its foray into the smartphone market without actually having to produce its own phone. Reports suggest that sales of the HTC First have been comparatively small: that sources at AT&T, the US's largest carrier, indicate that fewer than 15,000 of the phones had been sold by the end of its first month. By comparison, in the first three months of the year , of which about 1m were Android phones - an average of more than 300,000 per month. BGR says that the price cut will be used to try to shift stock, and that any surplus inventory will then be returned to HTC - creating a problem for the Taiwanese company, which in its but which had promised strong sequential growth in revenues for the April-June period. The HTC First is the company's second attempt to create a ""Facebook phone"" after the HTC Chacha in spring 2011, an phone with a dedicated button to let people update their Facebook status. ""With that one slash of the knife, AT&T has confirmed what everyone had already gathered; the Facebook phone is proving very unpopular,"" commented Richard Windsor of the RadioFreeMobile consultancy. .""If this was an isolated incident, then one could put it down to poor hardware, but installations and reviews of the software on other devices have also been poor."" Adam Mosseri, Facebook's product management director, said that ""This is just the start"". Facebook Home is an app launcher for Android phones which in effect takes over the phone, pushing normal apps to the background; the home screen shows photos from the user's Facebook feed, comments from the user's News Feed, and ""Chat Heads"" of friends with notifications. Facebook's challenge is to create a mobile app that is compelling for users: data suggests that it is the most-used application on smartphones, taking up 18% of all usage in its own right. But in trying to expand its influence beyond social networking so that it can mine the user's entire experience on the phone, Facebook seems to have stumbled. Facebook Home was initially available only on a limited range of phones - the HTC One X, First, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Those are reckoned to be a small proportion of the total Android installed base in the US, which is one of Facebook's largest markets. Windsor said: ""Facebook Home looked to me like the right idea but its execution and design appears to be somewhat clumsy and the users simply do not like it. The failure of Home is not a disaster; it just means that Facebook needs to try another way to engage users outside of social networking. Something less invasive, more intuitive and above all, more fun seems to be the order of the day."""
1468	1469	Revenge porn: why the right to be forgotten is the right remedy 	evenge porn is an undoubtedly vile phenomenon. A couple, often young and foolish with lust, get together and share trust and intimacy. In the modern style, they take pictures or videos of each other or “sext” each other revealing selfies. Then they break up and he posts these pictures on a website and labels her a whore to the world. Modern love? This is, of course, a very partial description. Revenge porn can cut across same-sex as well as heterosexual couples, and can be done by the girl to the boy as much as the other way round. Yet revenge porn is typically one of the nastiest offshoots of the misogynistic abuse rampant and normalised in the online space, as seen in recent cases like the . How then do we try to stop revenge porn, as we undoubtedly should? The kneejerk reaction – which we saw in to the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill last week – is to say . New criminal laws must be passed. Sentences must be extended. Draconian powers must be given demanding all social networks institute real name policies (even though ). A timely , released today, points out that something has already been done, and that even with a “new” phenomenon like revenge porn, new laws are both unnecessary and quite possibly counter-productive. In oral evidence given to the committee, the police, civil rights organisations, social networks and all pointed out that in fact we already have a multiplicity of overlapping criminal laws in place around harassment, threats, menace and abuse, which apply as much to the online world as the offline. Adding new laws to this existing jungle is likely to confuse the public, perplex arresting police and mystify the internet abuse teams which work across time zones on an international scale rather than looking at the laws of one small island. It would also be likely to lend scope to ill-conceived prosecutions jeopardising ordinary free speech rights, such as the notorious . The US experience (sadly about six months to a year in advance of the UK) is that what victims of revenge porn really want most urgently is a remedy, not a prosecution. While pictures of women branded as sluts, victims, home-wreckers (etc) stay accessible on the internet, job opportunities, new relationships, college entry and basic self-esteem are wrecked. On many US based sites, images stay up till blackmail is paid. Responsible sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr depend on the goodwill of their clientele and are already responsive to take down requests (although possibly not as fast as could be hoped – see below). But because websites hosted in the US benefit from a law which gives them complete immunity from prosecution or action relating to content posted by users, smaller, less reputable sites - like the notorious MyEx.com or IsAnybodyUp.com - can refuse to take down revenge porn without incurring legal liability and do so as a lucrative business model. Increasingly UK and EU women will find images of themselves, sickeningly, on these sites, and UK prosecutions, or longer sentences, will do little or nothing to help. A good remedy for the UK thus involves two steps : mandatory take down of images posted without consent from hosting sites in the UK, and, if take down is not obtainable because the host site is in the US and hiding behind a liability shield, a right to removal of the link from Google’s memory so a search on a name will not bring up as first result shocking pictures posted and hosted without consent. Many press reports have responded negatively to the recent , which held that a person has the right to have a link relating to their name which is inaccurate, misleading or distressing removed from the search engine – the so-called . Whether you view this as a vindication of basic rights to control our own personal data online, or a worrying trend for the public record online, it is an undoubted godsend to revenge porn victims. Google is the search engine of choice for around 90% of European users – if a link vanishes from their index, the content essentially ceases to exist. Some will say this is an after the fact remedy, and that we still need to make examples to stop people doing it in the first place. We again already have a law, the same law used in the recent high profile Twitter cases, which criminalises “malicious, threatening or grossly offensive” speech sent through email or posted online. Again the Lords report calls usefully for it to be clarified if “grossly offensive” does cover revenge porn, for which there is currently no clear case law. Long term revenge porn, just like Twitter misogyny and the kind of racist and homophobic abuse routinely hurled online at people like Tom Daley and Felix Mwamba, is not a criminal law problem but a social problem. We need, by education in schools and homes, by peer pressure and, most immediately, by swift and resolute response from hosting social networks, to show that this behaviour is unacceptable. Facebook and Twitter both revealed in oral evidence to the Lords that their abuse response teams – for their global markets, not the UK – were in the low hundreds not the thousands. They also pointedly refused to say how many abuse complaints they received per day, what their clean up rate was or the speed of response. Victims complain that response from abuse teams takes too long, and is hesitant when it comes. Facebook and Twitter’s watchword is self-help – block your abuser from your Twitter feed, ask your troll to stop tagging pictures of you. Blocking in revenge porn especially does precisely no good since the image is still out there, destroying reputations; self help is of course much cheaper and easier for the networks than investing in real-time monitoring or intervention. Worse is the frequent suggestion that women who suffer on social networks should simply withdraw from the internet. In today’s world, the internet is a vital part of all lives and asking women to withdraw from it to some kind of digital purdah is in itself shockingly misogynistic. As Criado-Perez herself : “When a woman does speak up, she runs the risk of being shouted down by a society that is still so scared of a woman’s voice, it must silence it by any means necessary - including the threat of rape, of death. “To that society, women must shout back and louder, until a woman’s voice is as unremarkable as a man’s. Only then will we combat the fear of a woman’s voice; only then will we live in a democracy worth the name.”

Writing anonymously on , the man explained that halfway into the screening at an AMC in Columbus, Ohio, he was hauled out by police and officers from homeland security's ICE unit, which monitors piracy. ""A guy comes near my seat, shoves a badge that had some sort of a shield on it, yanks the Google Glass off my face and says 'Follow me outside immediately',"" said the man, who was taken into a room for interrogation. His Glass had been switched off during the movie, and he was wearing it for its prescription lenses. ""After a long time somebody came with a laptop and an USB cable at which point he told me it was my last chance to come clean. I repeated for the hundredth time there is nothing to come clean about and this is a big misunderstanding so the [ICE officer] finally connected my Glass to the computer, downloaded all my personal photos and started going though them one by one … Then they went through my phone, and five minutes later they concluded I had done nothing wrong."" He wasn't apologised to, but was offered four free movie passes, which ""infuriated"" him. The ICE's Khaalid Walls confirmed the incident took place, and AMC responded with a statement: ""Movie theft is something we take very seriously, and our theatre managers contact the Motion Picture Association of America any time it's suspected that someone may be illegally recording content on screen.

1487	1488	Banks fined record €1.7bn over benchmark interest rate rigging cartel 	"The already battered reputation of banks took an expensive new hit yesterday when the slapped a record €1.7bn (£1.4bn) fine on six firms – including the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland – for colluding to fix key interest rate benchmarks. Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, warned that further fines were on the cards as three more banks, including HSBC, and one broker have refused to settle the long-running investigation by Brussels. He revealed that the authorities were in the process of unmasking a fresh scandal in the currency markets that could further damage the industry and add to the vast sums banks have had to pay for their mistakes since the financial meltdown. ""This will not be the end of the story, neither for interest-rate derivatives nor for the manipulation of benchmarks,"" Almunia said. ""One of the areas where we have received information that we are looking at very, very carefully is forex [foreign exchange]."" The latest fines – the first levied on a financial cartel by since the banking crisis began – take the total penalties for rigging Libor and other key interest-rate benchmarks to £3.5bn. Research by the London School of Economics (LSE) to be published next week will put a total of £100bn on the costs of misconduct for 10 major banks, including RBS, Barclays and Lloyds Group, in the five years to the end of 2012. That total has now risen by £30bn, according to an analysis for the Guardian by MSCI ESG Research. Roger McCormick, the LSE professor who led the research team, said: ""To put that into context, the one year's budget of the 24 richest nations for international aid is £80bn, and the national health service budget is £100bn to £110bn every year."" Yesterday's announcement saw two US banks, Citigroup and JP Morgan, receive their first fines over the interest-rate rigging scandal, while the other banks received fresh penalties on top of those already imposed by regulators. Barclays, the first bank penalised for rigging Libor when it was fined £290m in June last year, was also part of the Euribor cartel, the European equivalent of . However, this time the UK bank blew the whistle. In return for that help Barclays was let off another £570m fine. Similarly, the Swiss bank UBS escaped a £2.1bn fine by telling regulators about the cartel that had been rigging yen Libor. It had already paid £940m in fines related to manipulating the London Libor rate. Almunia said: ""What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other."" The biggest fine – £600m – was on Deutsche Bank, putting pressure on the Treasury minister Sajid Javid, who was previously head of global credit trading for Asia and had seat on the board of Deutsche's international operations division until he left in 2009. Javid said last night that while at the German bank he was not responsible for the departments hit by the fine and as a minister he had not held any talks with Brussels or any of the firms involved. The commission also inflicted more pain on RBS, which has suspended four traders and will now pay another £320m on top of £390m already handed over to US and UK regulators. The new fine adds to its public image problems following a systems meltdown this week and recent allegations, which it denies, that it has abused its small business customers. Its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, said: ""Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities."" The Euribor investigation focused on the period between September 2005 and May 2008 and the settlement involved Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Société Générale. In yen Libor, the banks involved were UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JP Morgan. The broker RP Martin was also involved, and fined for using its contacts with banks involved in settling Libor. Other banks yet to agree fines for fixing Euribor rates – apart from HSBC – are Crédit Agricole and JP Morgan. The money broker Icap, run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, is still facing penalties for rigging yen Libor. Almunia said: ""Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector."" Matt Moscardi, senior analyst at MSCI ESG Research, questioned whether the penalties were as hefty as they first appeared. ""If you look at RBS it is the equivalent to its revenues for five weeks. That's not much. If you think about the manipulation of a global interest rate where several trillion dollars are priced to it, you'd think they'd be more punitive."""
1492	1493	David Cameron has reservations about 'right to be forgotten' online 	" has reservations about the removal of factually correct information from the internet after a European court backed the principle of people having a ""right to be forgotten"", Downing Street has suggested. The prime minister's official spokesman said Cameron was still considering the ruling. ""I think the prime minister's view is that it is right that people take some time to look at this judgment. I think whilst taking time to consider and look at the judgment and possible implications, his view is that there is potentially a distinction to be drawn between dealing with the issue of information that is wrong, and correction of factually inaccurate information, as distinct from what some have characterised as seeking to hide factually correct information. ""I think that is a distinction that is relevant to this … the judgment is a fairly recent judgment, and a large number of parties will be considering it closely."" Hundreds of people, including a former politician seeking re-election, a paedophile and a doctor, have applied to have details about them wiped from Google's search index since . Asked whether a politician should be able to have information about their past removed from the internet, the spokesman said: ""I think rather than pick on and try and draw distinctions between particular groups, he would tend to consider a distinction between information that is factually inaccurate that may be online and information that is accurate."" When asked about the issue last week, Cameron said he endorsed the basic principle that ""your information belongs to you"", but said he had not had the time to consider the decision in full. Since the European court of justice ruling, applications have been made to remove links to information that the complainants say is outdated or irrelevant. The former UK politician now seeking election again wishes information about their behaviour while in office to be removed. A man convicted of possessing child abuse images has demanded links to pages about his conviction are removed, and a doctor has said that negative reviews from patients should not be searchable. , which has more than 90% of the search market in Europe, declined to comment on how many applications it had received, or their nature. ""The ruling has significant implications for how we handle take-down requests. This is logistically complicated not least because of the many languages involved and the need for careful review,"" a Google representative said. ""As soon as we have thought through exactly how this will work, which may take several weeks, we will let our users know."""
1495	1496	Tarantino's The Hateful Eight liveread: 'Reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs' 	"Director Quentin Tarantino and the website Gawker are at each other's throats over . Enraged that this had happened when casting had barely commenced, the director shut down the movie unilaterally (perhaps finally ...) and . In the meantime, to give the material a more controlled public airing, Tarantino arranged a live-read of the script in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's film programme. We gather at the venerable United Artists Theatre, a sumptuous 1927 movie palace, all faux-Byzantine motifs and three tiers of balconies, bearing our $200 tickets and plenty of questions. Is dead? Will this therefore be like some mythical reading of a legendary never-made movie, like Welles' Heart of Darkness or Jodorovsky's Dune? Which actors will appear, and will they be the same six to whom the leaked script was first sent? Tarantino has answers when he sweeps onstage dressed in a boxy Man in Black outfit with loud red piping. ""This is a first draft,"" he announces, ""and there will be a second, and a third."" So the movie seems to be getting made. He tells us that ""Chapter five will be totally rewritten, so this will be the only time it's ever performed."" Standing at a lectern stage-left, he introduces his cast: brings the house down. Kurt Russell follows him and the audience detects real movie-star charisma. Justified's Walton Goggins, Dexter's James Remar, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Amber Tamblyn and Bruce Dern fill out the other major roles. Various seats and microphones cover the stage: this is a reading, not a stage adaptation; there will be no blood, just a lot of finger-guns and Tarantino yelling ""blam-blam-blam!"" in his role as narrator, and reminding us occasionally that the landscapes we can't see are rendered in ""awesome, spectacular 70MM splendour!"" Tarantino runs a tight ship tonight, occasionally chiding the actors to keep to the script - ""no co-writing, please!"" - and ordering re-dos when dialogue is fluffed or lost amid the applause, but despite only three days of rehearsal, the cast is surprisingly together and on its collective toes. What we see tonight is more reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs than of Tarantino's more sprawling recent work: two locations, both claustrophobic and teeming with mutual suspicion and recrimination, with much occurring off-screen or in flashback. Tarantino opens with a lengthy sequence in a stagecoach as it tries to beat an incoming blizzard to the nearest shelter, Minnie's Haberdashery. On board are John Ruth (Russell), a brutal bounty hunter nicknamed The Hangman because he brings them in alive to the executioner, and his racist, foul-mouthed charge Daisy (Tamblyn, excellent), a woman whose crimes are for now withheld, but whose vileness and venom are instantly evident (John Ruth enjoys punching her in the face - a lot). The stage then picks up ex-Union Army officer and bounty-hunter Marcus West (Jackson), who has three frozen bounty-corpses to bring to town (he prefers the ""dead"" part of ""dead or alive""). Ruth has heard of him and offers grudging respect and a seat in the cabin, while Daisy merely screams ""Howdy, nigger!"" at him. At which point, Tarantino steps out of his impresario-narrator role, addresses the audience and says, ""For you who're counting, that's number one! There will be more!"" There is some frankly rather inappropriate cheering at this shout-out to our most potent secular blasphemy, but not, I note, from the two serious young black men sitting next to me. Suffice it to say, the N-word gets a vigorous workout throughout the night. A third passenger - Goggins - appears out of the snow, claiming to be the new sheriff of Red Rock, everyone's final destination. On arriving at Minnie's Haberdashery, we encounter an elderly Confederate general (Dern), and three suspicious-looking characters, a near-silent Madsen, an Englishman (Roth) who claims he's the new Red Rock executioner to whom Tamblyn will be delivered, and a Frenchman who claims to be running the place for the absent Millie and her husband. Soon enough someone poisons the coffee and two people drop dead, and the stage is set for a Miss Marple-ish search for the killer(s) among those present, with guns drawn and the room divided into warring ""northern"" and ""southern"" halves, and everyone wondering who everyone else really is. As the bodies pile up toward the conclusion, it's evident that chapter five will indeed require extensive rejigging. As it stands it's a mathematical, mechanical and rather rote culling of the cast through murder and bloodshed, and will require more layering and nuance to accord with the sprightly remainder of the script. As for the actors, Bruce Dern's small performance was a masterclass in acting, all vertiginous pauses, strategic moments of quiet, and effortless modulation. Russell was a truly commanding and charismatic presence, filling the room like he came with extra dimensions unavailable to mere character players. Tamblyn made her loathsome character pop and fizz, Jackson was very Jackson (at one point, he bursts out laughing and say, ""I can't believe I'm reading this...."" - a horrifying, blowjob-heavy soliloquy), and Goggins earns his second-lead status effortlessly. Tarantino, in PT Barnum showman mode, held it all together beautifully. If they ever get The Hateful Eight made, I'll be there. I just hope chapter five doesn't make it."
1496	1497	Quentin Tarantino to debut The Hateful Eight with a liveread of the screenplay 	" will direct a ""world premiere"" staged reading of the screenplay for his abandoned western The Hateful Eight in Los Angeles later this month. The Oscar-winning film-maker will take to the LA County Museum of Art's (LACMA) Bing Theatre on 24 April for what is being described as a ""special, once-in-a-lifetime event"". It will not be recorded or live-streamed and tickets, which go on sale on 9 April, will cost a whopping $200 each. ""Quentin Tarantino is a key figure in the independent creative community,"" said Josh Welsh, president of organiser . ""We are thrilled that Quentin will be holding the world premiere staged reading of his script of The Hateful Eight with Film Independent at LACMA"". Tarantino is currently for encouraging readers to view an online copy of the 146-page screenplay in January. Tarantino had earlier said he would not move forward with The Hateful Eight, which he had been intending to shoot as a followup to 2012's Django Unchained, after it was leaked onto the web. In his suit, the film-maker claimed Gawker ""crossed the journalistic line by promoting itself to the public as the first source to read the entire screenplay illegally"". For its part, the website has filed a motion to dismiss which is due to be heard by a judge on 14 April. Film Independent, a non-profit-making organisation which supports independent film, said The Hateful Eight followed the ""steadily ratcheting tension that develops after a blizzard diverts a stagecoach from its route, and traps a pitiless and mistrustful group which includes a competing pair of bounty hunters, a renegade Confederate soldier, and a female prisoner in a saloon in the middle of nowhere"". The LACMA event will see Tarantino read stage directions and direct a group of actors he selects through material ""that mixes distinctively etched characters, drama, humour and violence"", according to its website. All proceeds from the reading will go towards funding programming for Film Independent events at the museum. It is not known whether the actors involved will include those Tarantino had intended to feature in his film. The director named the agents of Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern, who had been set for roles in the movie, as possible culprits when he revealed the initial leak in January."
1499	1500	20 ways to keep your internet identity safe from hackers 	"e're high up in the Gherkin in the City of London and Garry Sidaway, director of security strategy at Integralis, a firm which advises government agencies, pharmaceutical and financial services multinationals, is giving my computer a security MOT. ""You don't have anti-virus software, I see,"" he says, a trace of mockery in his voice. ""That's your first mistake."" According to Sidaway, while most of us are much more aware of the risks now (""My mum shreds her documents even if she doesn't know why,"" he says), we should all be raising the bar. He thinks we Britons are an overly trusting lot. Sitting ducks for an armada of hackers, who are every bit as focused on stealing our data as we are relaxed about storing it. ""The criminal gangs know exactly which kind of data they want and where it is likely to be,"" he explains. ""Conversely we're not sure what they're after."" So what are they after, I ask? ""We are seeing a wide variety of attacks – everything from opportunists trying to extract passwords through phishing [emails which purport to be from legitimate sources and attempt to get us to click on an infected link] to highly organised crime units targeting businesses and government systems in an effort to steal intellectual property and information related to critical infrastructure."" The government estimates that the total cost of cybercrime in the UK is £27bn a year. The majority (£21bn) is committed against businesses, which face high levels of intellectual property theft and industrial espionage. Enabled by the sharing culture on social media – and with ever more sophisticated malicious software known as malware at their disposal – cybercriminals have become far more adept at crafting attacks and targeting individuals and organisations. Phishing emails purporting to be from friends, often reflecting our interests – perhaps gleaned from social media sites – or from trusted organisations such as your bank or HM Revenue & Customs encourage us to click on infected links or attachments containing malware. (A recent example of the latter was malware disguised as a security warning from Microsoft's digital crimes unit.) ""We have a level of trust in certain organisations and criminals exploit that trust,"" says Sidaway. Typically, these so-called ""man-in-the-middle"" attacks install colourfully named Trojans (pieces of malware, essentially) such as Zeus, SpyEye or Citadel on computers, which have the effect of compromising, for example, online banking transactions. ""Everything you then do on your compromised laptop is subverted through a hacking site which means when you [communicate] with your bank, you are going through a man in the middle. Initially, man-in-the-middle attacks were passwords used in authentication – the criminal would wait until you had finished to start using the credentials they'd just gathered. This is why banks brought in one-time passwords or codes,"" he says. ""But more recent malware will perform a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain the user's session (a session is created after a user logs in successfully and the browser and the bank's website use this to continue the interaction) and fake the logout requests. Once the user thinks they've logged out, the attacker can make payments using the existing session without the victim seeing any changes to their balance until the next time they log on. This is partly why banks have rolled out card readers to help prevent payments to new payees."" He adds: ""It's a constant game of cat and mouse."" The golden rule. The main way criminals infect PCs with malware is by luring users to click on a link or open an attachment. ""Sometimes phishing emails contain obvious spelling mistakes and poor grammar and are easy to spot,"" says Sidaway of Integralis. ""However, targeted attacks and well-executed mass mailings can be almost indistinguishable [from genuine emails]."" Social media has helped criminals profile individuals, allowing them to be much more easily targeted, he adds. ""They can see what you're interested in or what you [post] about and send you crafted messages, inviting you to click on something. Don't."" With individuals typically having anything up to 100 online accounts, the tendency has become to share one or two passwords across accounts or use very simple ones, such as loved ones' names, first pets or favourite sports teams. Indeed, last month revealed that over half of UK adults (55%) use the same passwords for most, if not all, websites they visit, while one in four (26%) use birthdays or names as passwords. Any word found in the dictionary is easily crackable. Instead, says Sian John, online security consultant at Symantec, have one memorable phrase or a line from a favourite song or poem. For example: ""The is a Sunday newspaper"" becomes ""toiasn"". Add numerals and a special character thus: ""T0!asn"". Now for every site you log on to, add the first and last letter of that site to the start and end of the phrase, so the password for Amazon would be ""AT0!asnn"". At first glance, unguessable. But for you, still memorable."" A hacker who has cracked your main email password has the keys to your [virtual] kingdom. Passwords from the other sites you visit can be reset via your main email account. A criminal can trawl through your emails and find a treasure trove of personal data: from banking to passport details, including your date of birth, all of which enables ID fraud. Identity theft is estimated to cost the UK almost £2bn a year. German security institute AV-Test found that in 2010 there were 49m new strains of malware, meaning that anti-virus software manufacturers are engaged in constant game of ""whack-a-mole"". Sometimes their reaction times are slow – US security firm and found that the initial detection rate of a new virus was only 5%. Much like flu viruses and vaccine design, it takes the software designers a while to catch up with the hackers. Last year of a 22-month study of 27 different anti-virus suites and top-scoring packages were , and . Meanwhile, security expert of a study of 42 packages which showed on average a 25% detection rate of malware – so they are not the entire answer, just a useful part of it. Just say no to social media invitations (such as Facebook-friend or LinkedIn connection requests) from people you don't know. It's the cyber equivalent of inviting the twitchy guy who looks at you at the bus stop into your home. Again, the principal risk is ID fraud. Trawling for personal details is the modern day equivalent of ""dumpster-diving"", in which strong-stomached thieves would trawl through bins searching for personal documents, says Symantec's John. ""Many of the same people who have learned to shred documents like bank statements will happily post the same information on social media. Once that information is out there, you don't necessarily have control of how other people use it."" She suggests a basic rule: ""If you aren't willing to stand at Hyde Park Corner and say it, don't put it on social media."" Features such as Find My iPhone, Android Lost or BlackBerry Protect allow you to remotely to erase all your personal data, should your device be lost or stolen. ""Absolutely, set it up,"" advises Derek Halliday of mobile security specialist Lookout. ""In the case where your phone is gone for good, having a wipe feature can protect your information from falling into the wrong hands. Even if you didn't have the foresight to sign up, many wipe your phone features can be implemented after the fact."" Before entering your card details, always ensure that the locked padlock or unbroken key symbol is showing in your browser, cautions industry advisory body Financial Fraud Action UK. Additionally the beginning of the online retailer's internet address will change from ""http"" to ""https"" to indicate a connection is secure. Be wary of sites that change back to http once you've logged on. Banks must refund a customer if he or she has been the victim of fraud, unless they can prove that the customer has acted ""fraudulently"" or been ""grossly negligent"". Yet as with any case of fraud, the matter is always determined on an individual basis. ""Anecdotally, a customer who has been a victim of a phishing scam by unwittingly providing a fraudster with their account details and passwords only to be later defrauded could be refunded,"" explains Michelle Whiteman, spokesperson for the Payments Council, an industry body. ""However, were they to fall victim to the same fraud in the future, after their bank had educated them about how to stay safe, it is possible a subsequent refund won't be so straightforward. Under payment services regulations, the onus is on the payment-service provider to prove that the customer was negligent, not vice versa. Credit card protection is provided under the Consumer Credit Act and offers similar protection."" Pop-ups can contain malicious software which can trick a user into verifying something. ""[But if and when you do], a download will be performed in the background, which will install malware,"" says Sidaway. ""This is known as a drive-by download. Always ignore pop-ups offering things like site surveys on e-commerce sites, as they are sometimes where the malcode is."" Most Wi-Fi hotspots do not encrypt information and once a piece of data leaves your device headed for a web destination, it is ""in the clear"" as it transfers through the air on the wireless network, says Symantec's Sian John. ""That means any 'packet sniffer' [a program which can intercept data] or malicious individual who is sitting in a public destination with a piece of software that searches for data being transferred on a Wi-Fi network can intercept your unencrypted data. If you choose to bank online on public Wi-Fi, that's very sensitive data you are transferring. We advise either using encryption [software], or only using public Wi-Fi for data which you're happy to be public – and that shouldn't include social network passwords."" Thinking about having one for your bank and other financial accounts, another for shopping and one for social networks. If one account is hacked, you won't find everything compromised. And it helps you spot phishing emails, because if an email appears in your shopping account purporting to come from your bank, for example, you'll immediately know it's a fake. Make no mistake, your shiny new MacBook Air can be attacked too. It's true that Macs used to be less of a target, simply because criminals used to go after the largest number of users – ie Windows – but this is changing. ""Apple and Microsoft have both added a number of security features which have significantly increased the effectiveness of security on their software,"" says Sidaway, ""but determined attackers are still able to find new ways to exploit users on almost any platform."" Err on the side of caution when asked if you want to store your credit card details for future use. Mass data security breaches (where credit card details are stolen en masse) aren't common, but why take the risk? The extra 90 seconds it takes to key in your details each time is a small price to pay. A DNS or domain name system service converts a web address (a series of letters) into a machine-readable IP address (a series of numbers). You're probably using your ISP's DNS service by default, but you can opt to subscribe to a service such as OpenDNS or Norton ConnectSafe, which redirect you if you attempt to access a malicious site, says Sian John. ""This is helpful for providing some security (and parental control) across all the devices in your home including tablets, TVs and games consoles that do not support security software. But they shouldn't be relied upon as the only line of defence, as they can easily be bypassed."" If your email or cloud service offers it – Gmail, Dropbox, Apple and do – take the trouble to set this up. In addition to entering your password, you are also asked to enter a verification code sent via SMS to your phone. In the case of Gmail you only have to enter a fresh code every 30 days or when you log on from a different computer or device. So a hacker might crack your password, but without the unique and temporary verification code should not be able to access your account. Keep it locked, just as you would your front door. Keying in a password or code 40-plus times a day might seem like a hassle but, says Lookout's Derek Halliday, ""It's your first line of defence."" Next-generation devices, however, are set to employ fingerprint scanning technology as additional security. On these sites in particular, says Symantec's Sian John, exercise vigilance. ""Check the seller feedback and if a deal looks too good then it may well be,"" she says. ""Keep your online payment accounts secure by regularly changing your passwords, checking the bank account to which it is linked and consider having a separate bank account or credit card for use on them, to limit any potential fraud still further."" Facebook regularly updates its timeline and privacy settings, so it is wise to monitor your profile, particularly if the design of Facebook has changed. Firstly, in the privacy settings menu, under ""who can see my stuff?"" change this to ""friends"" (be warned: setting this to ""friends of friends"" means that, , on average you are sharing information with 156,569 people). Also in privacy, setting ""limit old posts"" applies friends-only sharing to past as well as future posts. Thirdly, disable the ability of other search engines to link to your timeline. You should also review the activity log, which shows your entire history of posts and allows you to check who can see them. Similarly, you should look at your photo albums and check you're happy with the sharing settings for each album. In the future you may want to consider building ""lists"" – subsets of friends, such as close friends and family, who you might want to share toddler photographs with, rather than every Tom, Dick and Harriet. Also, remove your home address, phone number, date of birth and any other information that could used to fake your identity. Similarly you might want to delete or edit your ""likes"" and ""groups"" – the more hackers know about you, the more convincing a phishing email they can spam you with. Facebook apps often share your data, so delete any you don't use or don't remember installing. Finally, use the ""view as"" tool to check what the public or even a particular individual can see on your profile, continue to ""edit"" and adjust to taste. If this all sounds rather tedious, you just might prefer to permanently delete your account. While much of the above are technical solutions to prevent you being hacked and scammed, by preying on their gullibility, taking advantage of our trust, greed or altruistic impulses. Human error is still the most likely reason why you'll get hacked."
1501	1502	Google buys Waze map app for $1.3bn 	" announced on Tuesday it had bought Waze, a much fought-over Israeli social mapping company for an as yet unconfirmed $1.3bn. Both Apple and Facebook have reportedly been courting the startup that updates its service in real time by incorporating users' driving times and other feedback on accidents and traffic jams. In a Google said it plans to enhance Google Maps with Waze's traffic updates features, while improving Waze with Google's search capabilities. ""We've all been there: stuck in traffic, frustrated that you chose the wrong route on the drive to work. But imagine if you could see real-time traffic updates from friends and fellow travelers ahead of you, calling out 'fender bender ... totally stuck in left lane!' and showing faster routes that others are taking,"" Brian McClendon, Google vice president, wrote. ""The Waze community and its dedicated team have created a great source of timely road corrections and updates."" McClendon said the Waze product development team will remain in Israel and operate separately for now. The value of the deal has yet to be disclosed but at $1.3bn it is expected to be Google's fourth largest by dollar value. The search giant announced a major overhaul of its mapping products at its recent IO13 developer's conference in San Francisco and has been incorporating much more personal information into maps. McClendon, who heads Google's maps division, . Waze, a five-year-old company, was founded by Uri Levine, software engineer Ehud Shabtai, and Amir Shinar and originally called Linqmap. The free service has been growing rapidly. According to the company over 20m people were using the service as of June 2012, twice the number of people using the service six months previously. Waze claims users have driven over 3.2bn miles using the service."
1507	1508	MPs recommend comprehensive inquiry into Google's 'unconvincing' tax affairs 	" should face a comprehensive inquiry into its tax affairs from HM Revenue & Customs, a committee of MPs says, after concluding that the internet giant's tax arrangements were ""deeply unconvincing"" and that the company's own account of its operations made ""absolutely no sense"". A report from the all-party public accounts committee concluded that the search engine giant – under pressure over its low payments of corporation tax – uses financial arrangements with the intent of avoiding handing over money to the exchequer running into the billions. Margaret Hodge, the committee's chair, said the only way for Google to repair its damaged reputation was to arrange to pay a fair share of tax in the countries where it earns profits. She said that Google had ""brazenly"" argued that its tax affairs were defensible and lawful. The company had told Hodge's committee that its advertising sales take place in Ireland, rather than the UK, an argument which she described as ""deeply unconvincing and has been undermined by information from whistleblowers, including ex-employees of Google, who told us that UK-based staff are engaged in selling"". Concluding that Google's Irish employees simply processed the bills, Hodge said that Google adopted a ""highly contrived tax arrangement that has no purpose other than to enable the company to avoid UK corporation tax"". Her committee, in its report, also expressed surprise that the firm had not been previously challenged by the tax authorities over its arrangements. Google generated around £11.5bn in revenue from the UK between 2006 and 2011, but paid just £10m in corporation tax, found the PAC report. During this period, the main rate of corporation tax was between 26% and 30%. Hodge said the committee was not specifically singling out Google – or Starbucks and Amazon, companies that also gave evidence to the inquiry – but believed that their tax avoidance activities were illustrative of a much wider problem among multinationals in the modern globalised business environment. The report found that HMRC was ""not sufficiently challenging of multinationals' manifestly artificial tax structures"", noting that the taxman has never challenged an internet-based company in the courts on the key issue of the location of its ""permanent establishment"", which determines which country's taxes it should pay. Any commonsense reading of HMRC's own guidance suggests it should ""vigorously question Google's claim that it is acting lawfully"", said the committee. ""HMRC should now fully investigate Google in the light of the evidence provided by whistleblowers."" The PAC report is the culmination of a torrid seven months for the search engine's executives who first appeared in November but were recalled in May following evidence from whistleblowers who claimed that the firm had misled the committee. Revenue and Customs refused to comment on whether it was undertaking any inquiry into Google. But last month, met one former Google employee, Barney Jones, and were handed thousands of electronic documents related to the firm's sales activities. In an interview with the Guardian, given before the PAC report had been published, Jones said he had decided to give evidence to MPs after he had heard Matt Brittin, Google's vice-president responsible for the UK, give evidence previously. Brittin had told MPs that ""nobody [in the UK] is selling"". Jones said: ""I looked at his story and could not believe what I saw."" Brittin was brought back in front of the committee in May over evidence from whistleblowers which showed ""clear discrepancies"" with his claim that none of Google's 1,300 UK staff were working in sales. At that hearing, Hodge questioned the appropriateness of Google's ""Don't be evil"" motto, telling Brittin: ""I think that you do do evil, in that you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax."" After taking evidence from Google's UK auditor Ernst & Young, the committee found that the reputation of Britain's big accountancy firms had been damaged by ""their substantial role in advising their clients on corporate structures and tax planning which serve only to help them avoid UK taxes"". Google said it complied with UK tax law, and a spokesman added: ""It's clear from this report that the public accounts committee wants to see international companies paying more tax where their customers are located, but that's not how the rules operate today. We welcome the call to make the current system simpler and more transparent."" A Revenue & Customs official said that HMRC did not comment on inquiries into taxpayers such as Google. The head of business tax, Jim Harra, said: ""Since 2010 we have collected over £23bn in extra tax through challenging large businesses' tax arrangements. Through tackling transfer pricing issues, we have collected £2bn since 2010 alone. We relentlessly pursue businesses who don't play by the rules. These results reflect this."""
1508	1509	Maria Miller warns internet firms on child abuse images 	"Internet providers are to face unrelenting pressure to restrict access to ""horrific"" and illegal images of child abuse, the culture secretary, , will say on Tuesday at a summit with the world's leading ISPs. In a sign of the government's impatience with the likes of Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Twitter, sources say the firms must do more after acting as though ""blind"" to the problem of child abuse images. Miller said: ""Child abuse images are horrific and widespread public concern has made it clear that the industry must take action. Enough is enough. ""In recent days we have seen these companies rush to do more because of the pressure of an impending summit. Imagine how much more can be done if they seriously turn their minds to tackling the issue. Pressure will be unrelenting."" She will say that the companies summoned to the summit have a good record in removing illegal images when they are brought to their attention. But she will call on them to do more and use their technical expertise to ensure the images never appear online in the first place. One source said: ""These are huge global companies at the cutting edge of technology. They should direct their technical expertise – coding and algorithms – to preventing the problem at source. ""Companies have acted blind towards the systemic problem of child abuse images. If they are allowed to act as though they are blind, then they do not have to take responsibility. They must be made to acknowledge the extent of the problem and take responsibility."" Miller believes internet providers have shown there is room to act because they have made a series of commitments in the runup to the summit. Google has pledged £4m towards addressing the problem while TalkTalk and BT have promised splash pages which will pop up with a warning about pornographic content. Google has said it will donate to the Cambridge-based , a charity which collates warnings about illegal sites and has a team of analysts who have been under increasing pressure as the number of reports they receive has risen. One ISP, Virgin Media, will also call for rival companies to stop charging the police-run for processing data requests about individuals believed to have accessed illegal abuse sites. Web firms are privately sceptical that the 90-minute meeting will deliver a silver-bullet solution for the propagation of explicit content, but they are united in the belief that the charities responsible for policing such material should be better funded. ""There is no simple technical fix to this problem and money alone cannot solve it either. If it could, it would have been done years ago,"" said one internet executive. The culture secretary also wants to do more to ensure parents can protect children by blocking access to legal pornography. at the weekend, she said a code of practice on parental controls had been drawn up with the major internet providers. Miller and ministerial colleague Ed Vaizey will meet Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, BT, Sky, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Vodafone, O2, EE and Three at the summit."
1517	1518	Anthony Mann: Man of the West 	hen Anthony Mann died in 1967, he was planning a Western King Lear, with sons replacing the daughters. This long-cherished project might have turned out to be a classic, since no director of Westerns made them nearer to classical tragedy - and Mann had a feeling for landscape to equal John Ford. The best also reveal in their protagonists an acute sense of human fallibility and self-doubt. Many of the Westerns directed by Mann in the 50s, such as Winchester 73 and The Man From Laramie, starred James Stewart. Not only did they give the actor a new lease of life; they remain outstanding within the genre. But the greatest of all, Man of the West, made in 1958, starred Gary Cooper. He was Link Jones, a reformed gunfighter who is forced to betray his new-found pacifism by annihilating one by one the gang who used to be his comrades. The film brings to the fore all Mann's preoccupations and knits them perfectly together. Lear is paralleled by the fact that Lee J Cobb's gang leader regards Link as his favourite son and, before he realises what is happening, welcomes him back with open arms. Link is travelling from a community he has helped build to Fort Worth to find a teacher for the new school. His train is ambushed and robbed by his former colleagues. Stranded, he is forced to return to the gang's old hideout for shelter. There he gets into a fight with one of his old friends that ends in him stripping the man of his clothes. They are both humiliated - the crook for obvious reasons, Link because he has had to resort to a violence he has come to hate. If he wants to save himself and his new life, he realises he has to deny everything he now holds dear. The finale is inevitable: Cooper versus Cobb, and one of them will surely die. Both actors give extraordinary performances. Cooper, in real life getting sick with the cancer that was to kill him three years later, makes one last, successful effort to prove he could be a consummate screen actor and Cobb contributes a dignified performance that does not entirely preclude our sympathy. Mann's direction is immaculate, making Reginald Rose's clearly allegorical, and sometimes forced, screenplay seem even better than it is. Mann's career started with low-budget thrillers, progressed to Westerns, and ended with epics such as El Cid and The Fall of the Roman Empire. He never glorified violence but set it within the context of his stories. He was a film-maker who, at his best, could be compared to anyone in matching the power of his images with his blunt version of psychological truth.
1521	1522	Cannes 2014 roundup: from Gosling's roasting to a genuine Leviathan 	"o what was the buzz among critics in Cannes this year? The buzz was actually the sound of snoring in press shows. It wasn't because the films were dull, but because a competition densely packed with A-list names — plus several films running way over the two-hour mark — made this year's festival unusually exhausting. Factor in the stamina required to get into some shows, then add the fact that whatever you're watching you're distracted by worries about getting to the next film in time. That's what screenings here are like — you fight to get in, you fight to get out, and in between you fight to stay awake. In fairness, this was a solid but unexceptional Cannes, with little to match the euphoric explosion of last year's , and nothing that had people arguing like 2013's Palme d'Or, . There were plenty of fine films in competition, such as Mike Leigh's superb , but some of the best were by auteurs doing their trademark dependably and satisfyingly, yet without providing many surprises. Belgium's Dardenne brothers offered a tough, politically committed and finally uplifting realist drama. is about a woman (Marion Cotillard) facing redundancy who has to persuade her workmates to forgo their bonuses in order to keep her job. It's typically sober and elegant, and Cotillard excels in a nervy, vulnerable role. There was a somewhat academic staidness to several titles. Tommy Lee Jones's solemn western rang intriguing changes on the / theme of ""righteous-schoolmarm-meets-grizzled-old-coot"" (respectively, Hilary Swank and TLJ himself), but you suspect the film would have been sparkier if Clint Eastwood had made it 20 years ago. The other heavyweight US contender was Bennett Miller's , an offbeat drama about a blue-collar wrestler (Channing Tatum) and his eccentric old-money sponsor (an unrecognisable Steve Carell, seemingly wearing Nicole Kidman's old nose from ). addresses themes of class and power in America with self-conscious earnestness, and while the acting is quite brilliant, especially Carell's unnervingly odd turn, the film smacks of Oscar-season prestige rather than Croisette . Such studiousness dogged two other competition contenders. Nuri Bilge Ceylan's was a punishing three-and-a-quarter hour workout from the Turkish master. Ceylan shoots among the stunning, strange landscapes of , but perversely keeps most of the action indoors, staging extended ruminations in rooms — on themes of sibling rivalry, mortality and ethics. It's superbly acted, and a substantial, very mature film, but it feels rather like being made to sit down and digest a heavyweight modernist novel in one sitting. Similarly literary and pensive was , in which France's Olivier Assayas combined some modish themes — the internet, celebrity gossip, superhero movies — with some hoarier themes regarding the theatre-cinema divide, ageing and female rivalry. It's an -style drama about a successful film actress (Juliette Binoche) whose relationship with her PA (a quite startlingly good Kristen Stewart) begins to duplicate the anguished dynamic of the stage play she's rehearsing. But it's at once glossily chic and somewhat academic. Variations on the theme were explored to rather livelier effect in David Cronenberg's Tinseltown satire . This caustic ensemble comedy is about a neurotic actress (Julianne Moore) haunted by her dead mother, a repellent Bieber-esque teen star (terrific up-and-comer Evan Bird) and a deranged waif (Mia Wasikowska) with a dark past. With a very mischievous script by Bruce Wagner, breaks little new ground (Hollywood is full of needy narcissists — who knew?), but it was the best, most scabrous fun to be had here. Also providing mischief was by Jean-Luc Godard. With his usual magisterial disdain, Godard again declined to visit the Croisette, but shook things up with another free-form essay in the vein he's developed over the past two decades — a radically fragmented flash-fry of sounds, texts, images and gags, and this time, all in 3D. At a couple of points, he separates the picture into two layers, then has them join up again, as if by magic. It's hard to describe, but you come out of the film asking yourself, ""What the hell just happened?"" What with its wildly accentuated colours and textures, watching was pretty bracing — the cinematic equivalent of sticking your finger into a light socket for 70 minutes. It wouldn't be a proper Cannes without flops, and this year brought some corkers. In 2011, director Michel Hazanavicius delighted Cannes with the grace and ebullience of his silent pastiche . That film's success has enabled him and wife Bérénice Béjo to make their big humanitarian statement, . Set in Chechnya, the film involves a traumatised war orphan, the human rights worker (Béjo) who takes him in, and a young Russian soldier who receives his training in military violence at a boot camp that makes look like . Hazanavicius has clearly done his research, both into the Chechen conflict and into the bleaker end of eastern European cinema, and contains perhaps 45 minutes of very compelling cinema. But the film soon plummets into well-meaning kitsch, not least because of Béjo's excruciatingly gauche performance. went down very badly, but even greater contempt was showered on , the directorial debut by Hollywood golden boy Ryan Gosling, in the Un Certain Regard strand. This grisly slice of hipster Gothic is set in a magic-realist version of modern Detroit, and involves a long-suffering single mom (Christina Hendricks) who falls into the clutches of a ruthless bank manager (Ben Mendelsohn) – the sort who dances, sings Nick Cave-style ballads, and moonlights by running the kind of nightclub where every night is David Lynch tribute night. The photography, by Gaspar Noé associate Benoît Debie, is magnificent (there's a shade of purple here that I've never seen anywhere before, in life or on screen). Overall, though, the film is an incoherent stew of stylistic borrowings and gruesome chic. In the afternoon show, the film was enthusiastically booed: Gosling, you could say, got roundly goosed. Still, after a rough stretch, two magnificent films turned up at the end of the event. Russian competition entry , by Andrey Zvyagintsev, who made 2003's , delivered the frisson of sublimity that people had expected from the Ceylan film. This modern retelling of the Job story, set on a barren coastline, is about a family who fatally tangle with a crooked official. It's a film of ferocious political rage, railing against Russia's corrupt masters, but it's also mysterious and poetic, eventually opening out to metaphysical perspectives. And while it's deeply contemplative, its narrative fairly barrels along. For a killer combination of energy, imagination and visionary cinematic power, fairly lives up to its name. At the time of going to press, it was a sure front-runner for the Palme d'Or (which was announced last night). Finally, one of those films that you excitedly tell people about when you get home, and they think you're having them on. A Ukrainian film entirely in sign language, without subtitles, is set in a boarding school for deaf children and teenagers, an establishment where prostitution, gangsterism and brutal revenge are high on the curriculum. With its cast of young, deaf non-professionals, uses its absence of spoken words to completely rethink how a film communicates, to startling effect. Debut director Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy is already a master of long takes and complex crowd choreography, and manages to juggle brute realism, dry comedy and a potent streak of eroticism. I was on the jury that awarded one of three awards it scooped in Critics' Week, and for me, the film is not just the highlight of that section, but the great discovery of this year's festival. In a noisy 12 days, 's silence spoke as loudly as anything. "
1523	1524	Cannes: Off-screen incidents leave their mark on festival 	"s this year's Cannes festival ends, one inescapable conclusion is that the real action has taken place not inside the cinema but just outside its doors. A string of incidents has led to a prison sentence, calls for a crackdown on festival ""pranks"" and a theological row over a kiss. When critics speak of criminally bad acting, they rarely intend for the performer to actually be incarcerated. Yet that's what happened at the festival last week, when a street performer was arrested by riot police when he continued with an impromptu act after being asked to stop. A shoe-seller from Cap Vert, Jason Monteiro Furtado, 21, was on holiday in the town and began what has been described as a lighthearted turn, delivered from just behind the removable security barriers that line the main drag in Cannes. These waist-high metal fences are manned by riot police and seek to separate the public from delegates and stars. He was escorted off the Croisette and on Friday sentenced to six months in jail followed by deportation. ""Pranksters"" have so far avoided such draconian sanctions, though perhaps not for much longer. Last weekend, a Ukrainian TV presenter famed for stunts to embarrass celebrities jumped the barrier and crawled under the skirts of America Ferrera, the 20-year-old who lends her voice to DreamWorks' family animation . The man, Vitalii Sediuk was quickly led away but Ferrera was shaken by the experience and many online called for the manoeuvre to be reclassified as sexual assault. After crashing the stage during a speech by Adele at last year's Grammys, Sediuk was charged with entering a performance area and interfering with performance, but escaped a jail term. He was not detained following his exploits at Cannes, though the chances of his festival pass being renewed seem slim. Even the most apparently innocuous festival behaviour has led to grave fallout. On the opening night, festival president Gilles Jacob, 83, offered a quick peck on the cheek to jury member Leila Hatami, who starred in the 2012 foreign language Oscar-winner . Such action was denounced by Hizbollah Students, a group of university pupils with links to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, who called for her prosecution for the ""sinful act of kissing a strange man in public"". ""Furthermore,"" they wrote, ""the action of this film star has hurt the religious sentiments of the proud and martyrs breeding nation of Iran and as such we also demand the punishment of flogging for her as stipulated in the law."" Jacob, who retires at the end of this festival, played down the incident, explaining such behaviour as French custom, but on Friday Hatami sent an apologetic letter to Iran's cinema organisation. Jacob, she said, had had the intentions of ""old grandfather who was also my host"", but had forgotten the sharia rules which dictate her behaviour – ""which comes with old age"". ""My pre-emptive action of hand shaking was fruitless,"" she wrote. ""Although I am embarrassed to give these explanations, I had no choice but to go into details for those who could not understand the inevitable situation that I was stuck in."" This year's awards were being distributed on Saturday evening, a day earlier than usual because of strikes in France. Her letter became public as the jury of which she is a part deliberated over this year's awards, which are distributed on Saturday evening (a day earlier than usual on account of French strikes on Monday, when many festival-goers would traditionally depart). The frontrunner is still Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Winter Sleep, a three-and-a-half Turkish drama about an actor grappling with marital breakdown in the mountains. But there is strong competition from Leviathan, a Russian epic inspired by the Book of Job and full of barbed digs at the Moscow administration, and from Mike Leigh's artist biopic Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall. The left-field contender is Timbuktu, Abderrahame Sissako's story set in the west-African state of Mali, which has been taken over by strict Islamic jihadists. One scene shows a couple buried to death in the sand for a relationship; another has a woman sentenced to 40 lashes for listening to music, and another 40 for being alone in a room with a man (the musician, who has been strumming very quietly on a guitar). Whether Hatami's troubles will help or hinder Timbuktu's chances remains to be seen. But at a festival which seeks at every turn to reiterate its belief that art is paramount, this year it is the events outside the cinema which have threatened to steal the spotlight."
1526	1527	iPhone 6 launch to break Apple records, say reports 	Apple is planning its biggest iPhone launch to date with the expected larger , according to leaks from the supply chain. The company has demanded 70-80m iPhones covering the expected 4.7in and 5.5in models by the end of the year, the . The combined order surpasses last year’s 50-60m and 5C numbers, which was the largest new iPhone launch at the time. Apple broke records, selling 9m iPhones in the first weekend, but the iPhone 5S outsold the cheaper iPhone 5C by two to one. The iPhone 5C failed to live up to expectations, causing Apple’s suppliers to cut production and Apple to introduce a cheaper 8GB 5C to try to ignite sales. Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, said that the company’s strategy of both phones at the same time - the first in the iPhone’s history - did not go to plan. “I think last quarter we did a tremendous job, particularly given the mix was something very different than we thought,” . “It was the first time we’d ever run that particular play before, and demand percentage turned out to be different than we thought.” Rumours for the larger iPhones, the first to move past 4in screens, have put doubt on the efficacy of a large launch for the iPhone 6. Some have pointed to Apple’s as the cause of production issues, which have been difficult to produce in large areas like those required by 4.7in and 5.5in smartphone screens.
1528	1529	Philip Seymour Hoffman obituary 	", who has died aged 46 of a suspected drugs overdose, had three names and 3,000 ways of expressing anxiety. He was a prolific and old-fashioned character actor, which is not a euphemism for ""odd"" – it means he could nail a part in one punch, summoning the richness of an entire life in the smallest gesture. And, yes, he could also look splendidly odd, with his windbeaten thatch of sandy hair, porcine eyes and a freckled face that would glow puce and glossy with rage. His acting style was immune to the temptations of caricature. His rise in the 1990s coincided with the emergence of a new wave of American film-makers, and his versatile, volatile talent became integral to some of the most original US cinema of the past 20 years. He was also an accomplished stage actor and director whose notable achievements included a 2000 Broadway production of Sam Shepard's True West, during which he and his co-star John C Reilly alternated parts, and co-founding . He made his debut as a film director with a 2010 adaptation of Bob Glaudini's play , in which he reprised his stage performance as the title character, a limousine driver edging tentatively toward romance. It was for screen acting alone that Hoffman was best known. His speciality was the craven and the carbuncular. He could take the most pitiful souls – his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies – and imbue each of them with a wrenching humanity. The more pathetic or deluded the character, the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous. Not that it came easily. ""It's hard,"" he said in 2012. ""The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult."" He told this paper that ""just because you like to do something doesn't mean you have fun doing it; and I think that's true about acting"". From his first, minor supporting roles in the early 1990s, he proved the old saw that there are no small parts, only small actors – and he was small in neither sense of the word. Built like a truck, and as dishevelled as a trucker, he used his frame and his unkemptness with immense dexterity. When he played sad-sacks riddled with self-loathing, such as the boom operator who squirms with unrequited love for a male colleague in Boogie Nights (1997), or an obscene phone-caller in Happiness (1998) who fails to make good on his threats when his bluff is called, he used his bulk to emphasise those characters' rancid unease. But as the pompous Freddie in The Talented Mr Ripley (1999), he deployed his body as a blunt instrument, butting in where he was not welcome. It was one of the tricks of Hoffman's elegantly cruel performance that when Freddie met his bloody end, the audience was likely to feel relieved and complicit; he was such a doggedly discomfiting presence, it was clear he could be stilled only by death. ""This actor is fearless,"" said Meryl Streep of his work in the movie. ""He's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and made him fascinating."" These were the parts that established Hoffman's reputation. Boogie Nights was especially notable for cementing the actor's collaboration with the writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson. That was his most fruitful creative partnership, spanning all but one of Anderson's six films. They first worked together on the director's debut, the thriller Hard Eight (1996). After Boogie Nights, Anderson gave Hoffman a rare saintly role in the multi-character drama Magnolia (1999). It was one of the peculiarities of Hoffman's skill that the more benevolent or affable his role, the more his natural idiosyncrasies seemed stymied. As a kindly nurse in Magnolia, or a naive screenwriter in David Mamet's State and Main (2000), or a good-hearted drag queen helping a gruff cop (Robert De Niro) who has suffered a stroke in Flawless (1999), Hoffman seemed subdued, even thwarted. It was not that he could not play good guys; rather that he excelled at locating the virtues in the apparently vile. Fortunately Anderson went on to cast him as the boss of a phone-sex line in Punch-Drunk Love (2002) and as the leader of a Scientology-like religion in The Master (2012). For their work on the latter picture, effectively an extended two-man face-off, Hoffman and his co-star Joaquin Phoenix shared the best actor prize at the Venice film festival. Though he was nominated three times in the best supporting actor category at the Academy Awards (for Charlie Wilson's War, Doubt and The Master), his one actual Oscar was for best actor for Capote (2005), in which he played the barbed, lisping wit during his period. Unlike Toby Jones, who was Capote in a rival movie, Infamous, Hoffman was not a natural physical fit for the part. His performance amounted therefore to an act of will equivalent to Anthony Hopkins playing Nixon. He bridged a similar chasm as Willy Loman, a character far older than him for the majority of the play's action, in Mike Nichols's 2012 Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman: he had first played the part aged 17 as a high school senior. Hoffman was born in Fairport, New York, to Gordon Stowell Hoffman, a former executive at Xerox, and his wife, now Marilyn O'Connor, who worked as a civil rights activist, lawyer and family court judge. His parents divorced when Hoffman was nine, and he and his two sisters and one brother were raised by their mother. Though his initial aptitude was in sports, a neck injury put paid to his wrestling ambitions and he joined an acting group at her encouragement. He spent a summer at the and studied drama at the . He graduated in 1989, but a spell in rehab to combat alcoholism and drug dependency preceded the start of his professional acting career. He made a further return to rehab in May last year. Early opportunities to indulge his skill for making unctuousness compelling came in the roles of a school snitch in the Al Pacino vehicle Scent of a Woman (1992), for which Hoffman auditioned five times. That brought him to the attention of Anderson, who cast him as a gambler in Hard Eight. In no time, the secret was out that Hoffman was an actor who could bring colour and vitality to any film. He was one of a team of tornado-chasers in the blockbuster Twister (1996), produced by . And in only a handful of scenes he brought to ripe, repugnant life a sycophantic functionary in the Coen brothers' caper The Big Lebowski (1998). Suddenly Hoffman was everywhere. His name on the credits became a reliable indicator that, however poor the film, there would at least be an eccentric or abrasive component – a case in point being Patch Adams (1999), in which Hoffman provides some prickly relief from the picture's ingratiating star, Robin Williams. He had a film-stealing cameo as the music journalist Lester Bangs in Almost Famous (2000), played a forlorn widower in Love Liza, written by his brother Gordy, and gave a tender portrayal of a teacher excited by a student's attentions in one of the sub-plots of Spike Lee's 25th Hour (both 2002). Cold Mountain (2003), in which he had a small role as a disreputable preacher during the American civil war, was Hoffman's second film with the British director (after The Talented Mr Ripley), while the Ben Stiller comedy Along Came Polly (2004) provided him with a rare digression into broad mainstream high jinks. The success of Capote paved the way for bigger and more nuanced parts for Hoffman, his turn as the villain in Mission: Impossible III (2006) notwithstanding. He had a striking hat-trick in 2007: he was moving and funny as one of a pair of siblings caring for a parent with dementia in The Savages, and bullish in Charlie Wilson's War as a cynical, overbearing CIA agent with a disturbing moustache. Best of all was his bestial turn as a conniving dunce who persuades his brother to join him in robbing their parents' jewellery store in 's oddly melancholy heist thriller Before the Devil Knows You're Dead; Hoffman made sure we felt for the character through his every malevolent mis-step. An adaptation of the Broadway hit Doubt (2008), in which he played a priest who may or may not have abused an altar boy, was a rather silly prestige project. As a flamboyant American DJ, the actor brought a little gravitas to Richard Curtis's woeful comedy The Boat That Rocked (2009). He starred opposite George Clooney in the political thriller The Ides of March and with Brad Pitt in the acclaimed sports drama Moneyball (both 2011). Last year he was seen as a musician with marital problems in the drama A Late Quartet. Having appeared in the second film in the lucrative Hunger Games series, Catching Fire (2013), he moved on to the third and fourth instalments, Mockingjay Part I and Part II; he was said to have almost completed his scenes at the time of his death. Arguably his towering accomplishment, though, is his performance in the 2008 oddity Synecdoche, New York, written and directed by Charlie Kaufman. Dominating the film, Hoffman plays a theatre director who uses a MacArthur grant to mount a detailed version of his own life, staged on a set of built to scale inside a colossal warehouse. Soon the project expands until there are warehouses within warehouses, populated by thousands of performers. A production first modelled on reality comes eventually to overwhelm and replace it. ""When are we going to get an audience in here?"" asks one of the actors. ""It's been 17 years."" But there is never going to be any audience. The mantra of Hoffman's obsessive character, which he is still murmuring as he dies, is: ""I know how to do this play now."" Hoffman is survived by his partner, the costume designer Mimi O'Donnell; their three children, Cooper, Tallulah and Willa; Gordy and his sisters, Jill and Emily; and his parents.

1530	1531	London film festival: Pawel Pawlikowski wins best film for Ida 	"British-based director Pawel Pawlikowski's latest film, , took the top prize at the close of the London film festival on Saturday night. The former film critic announced the Best Film award, saying: ""The jury greatly admired , the first film made in his native Poland by a director who came to prominence while living in Britain. We were deeply moved by a courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation – the German occupation and the Holocaust – which continues to resonate."" The film critic, Peter Bradshaw, was one of many who welcomed Pawlikowski's new work last week. Coming after the director's acclaimed , from 2000, and , made in 2004, it was, he wrote, ""a small gem, tender and bleak, funny and sad, superbly photographed in luminous monochrome"". The film tells of an orphan and novice nun who reaches out to her only surviving relative, an aunt. Johnny Depp made a surprise appearance at the awards dinner to present Sir Christoper Lee with a British Film Institute Fellowship, the highest accolade of the night. ""It is very kind and unexpected,"" Lee said, to a standing ovation. ""It means a lot to me that you are here."" Guests at the awards dinner included French's fellow jurors: actress Miranda Richardson; Lone Scherfig, director of the Oscar-nominated ; the Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto; and the author and screenwriter Deborah Moggach. Actors Stephen Dillane, Saoirse Ronan, Jim Broadbent, Colin Salmon and 's Joanne Froggatt also attended and Ronan, the star of , handed Jonathan Asser, screenwriter of , the Best British Newcomer award. The title of Asser's uncompromising debut feature refers to the practice of placing violent young offenders in an adult prison. Amanda Posey, jury president for this award, said: "" is an original story told with an individual and authentic voice, at once moving, provocative and always gripping. ""The material, even from a new screenwriter, was intelligent and distinctive enough to attract very high quality filmmaking talent and actors, and to help elicit extraordinary work from all involved. ""The whole jury felt Jonathan Asser brought a fresh, resonant and surprising perspective to a classic conflict."" Also picked out for praise by Posey were the performances of Asser's fellow nominees Conner Chapman and Shaun Thomas, who star in Clio Barnard's . ""The whole jury was blown away by these two performances and we could not separate them as, together, they are the heart of the film,"" Posey said. The Sutherland Award for first feature went to Anthony Chen, director of . ""The startlingly assured direction and screenwriting of the winning film surprised us all,"" said Elizabeth Karlsen, the jury president, before also commending Chika Anadu's for its ""visual and emotional elegance"". The winner of the Grierson Award for best documentary went to , a portrait of the largest commune in Europe, Friedrichshof, and the life of its residents. According to jury president Kate Ogborn, fellow jurors wanted to recognise the bravery of its director, Paul-Julien Robert. ""It is a thought-provoking and disturbing film,"" she said, ""intimate, while also raising larger questions of power, parental responsibility and abuse."""
1532	1533	Two Days, One Night review – small-town tale with a universal punch 	"he Dardenne brothers make films about hard times and tough choices, balancing so much human misery against soul-stirring acts of kindness. Their latest, , may be their most accomplished work to date; a socialist epic in miniature, heartfelt and humane. It's a film that finds the brothers shuffling away from the margins and embracing the mainstream. But they do so on their own terms, with their integrity intact. gives a rousing performance as Sandra, the depressed mother who faces the axe from her minimum-wage job at the solar panel plant. The management is bent on edging her out. Her cash-strapped colleagues have sold her clean down the river. Sandra's only hope is to persuade a majority of her co-workers to forgo their €1,000 bonuses ahead of an official vote on Monday morning. ""Fight for your job,"" her husband urges, and yet Sandra is hardly fit enough to haul herself out of bed, let alone wade into battle. The clock keeps on ticking and the weekend is running out. All credit to the for finding an intimate tragedy that shouts so loud to the world beyond. The brothers take one woman's tottering odyssey and give it the heft of a mythic struggle, like a low-rent labours of Hercules in which the original tasks are replaced by the locked door, the secret ballot and the bottle of Xanax on the bathroom shelf. Their heroine picks her way through the pebbledashed suburbs of her Belgian home town, pleading her case to people she has worked alongside and yet barely seems to know. Some refuse to let her in while others respond with a spluttering show of defiance. ""I didn't vote against you,"" one explains. ""I voted for my bonus."" Sandra, we come to realise, is not the only victim of this tale. Her fellow employees are similarly overstretched, working illicit weekend jobs. They need that €1,000 to keep their heads above water. And yet the harder Sandra toils, the more she grows in strength. She takes heart from her husband's support, from a glimmer of hope at a football pitch, and from the sound of Them's blues anthem Gloria, bursting like sunshine from the tinny speakers of the family car. Her weekend jaunt does not entirely go as planned. She sees the best of humanity in addition to the worst. If the film is full of victims, who exactly is the villain? Occasionally, one identifies a possible culprit. There are the brawling colleagues by the lock-up garage; the weaselly foreman who engineered the initial show of hands. Yet these, I think, are mere distractions, a set of stock and brutish archetypes. More likely the film's real evil-doer is the one we never see. Implicitly (and sometimes not so implicitly), slams and damns modern management techniques, lifting the lid on a culture of short-term contracts and non-unionised labour. What's the answer? Bond together. In throwing a lifeline to the anguished Sandra, the workers are surely rescuing themselves as well. The abiding irony of the Dardennes' situation is that their crusading, working-class stories are predominantly consumed by a bourgeois elite. They won their first Palme d'Or for 1999's (which climaxed with a bedraggled teenager hauling a gas canister across a trailer park) and their second for 2005's (welfare cheques; black market adoption). Critics dismiss them as the ""brothers grim"", purveyors of social-realist roughage for the festival circuit, and claim their work is more to be admired than actively enjoyed. But this may now be about to change. serves as a bang of the drum, a call to arms, complete with a plot that plays as a palm-sweating thriller, and an Oscar-winning actor bestriding centre stage. Who needs the obligatory Hollywood remake? The boxes have been ticked and the guns have been spiked. All at once, the brothers appear on the brink of a crossover success. Might the casting of Cotillard count as a compromise? I'm not sure that it does; or rather I'm not convinced that it matters. True, the Dardennes could have chosen to deliver their harsh truths in a less obviously fetching vessel. And yet Cotillard is never less than superb in the role. She's brittle and knackered, grubby and convincing. One has the sense, crucially, of a woman whose beauty has been so ground down by drudgery and depression that it has become at best an irrelevance and at worst a fading memory. ""I don't exist,"" Sandra laments to her husband, as she puts her hair in a scrunchy and embarks on her quest. She thinks her co-workers cannot see her but it soon turns out they can. With each house that she visits, she rediscovers her fire, reconnects to the world. Who cares, in the end, that the odds are stacked against her and that she may well not get the votes? tells us that the fight is always worth it, whatever the result. Even if Sandra loses, she has already won. Comments have been reopened to time with the film's Australian release."
1536	1537	Joaquin Phoenix: 'I feel like Santa Claus' 	"ou wouldn't necessarily figure for a morning person. It's 9am in California, the line is bad, his phone is faulty. Yet this is a man ecstatically happy. It sounds like you're at sea, I say, between the beeps and crackles. ""Oh great! I'm so glad it's not just me!"" He sounds genuinely over the moon. You'd be less thrown if he just grunted. Phoenix is an unpredictable interviewee. Will you get the mumbler? The joker? The Phoenix of , his mockumentary about chucking it all in for a career in hip-hop? Or the guy who smoked his way silently through the press conference for , followed by and a no-show at the awards ceremony? Two months ago, the US critic riffing on ambition and identity, race relations and the virtues of uncertainty. The piece because Phoenix damned awards season as ""bullshit"" (""it's the worst-tasting carrot I've ever tasted"") and said the Oscar campaign around his 2005 Johnny Cash biopic had made him profoundly uncomfortable (he was also nominated for five years previously). He's since offered , but clams up when I raise it. Mostly, though, Phoenix is just genial. He laughs almost constantly; a high guttural clucking, punctuated by long pauses and apologies and puffs on a breakfast cigarette. For one so self-conscious in his career choices, he's remarkably unself-regarding to talk to; almost as rackety and frank as Freddie Quell, his character in Paul Thomas Anderson's film – our movie of the year, of which his performance is the centrepiece. Quell is a damaged second-world-war navy vet; groggy on paintstripper liquor, reeling from a broken heart, who falls under the spell of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the baloney-preaching leader of a Scientology-style cult. But where Freddie stumbles about, twisted and listless, Phoenix – on the phone at least – freewheels more breezily. It doesn't feel like a performance. But I guess the best ones never do. Are you fucking serious? I don't fucking know. I don't know why people are eager for answers. I'm gonna say something that will probably offend somebody. I guess. I do agree that by their nature humans are very inquisitive. But I don't know why. I think related to the film … oh fuck it, I'm just gonna offend somebody; I should just shut up. No, I got nothing to say! ? Isn't it just real simple? Our awareness of our mortality, and how that terrifies us. I think it drives everybody in some way. As you become older you become increasingly aware of your mortality. It's a subconscious thing – I don't think you wake up every day and go: 'Fuck me, I'm dying, I'd better do something.' I think early on the drive is just that people tell you you're supposed to be driven, you're supposed to do something by the time you're 25; to have gone to college or got married, and then at some point your drive is just that you're aware of your mortality. That's just my theory. An eternal lasting change? I dunno. There's no one great epiphanous moment. That felt accurate. Things do change and then he just reverts back to his animalistic self. Sure, that makes sense. I think whether you like it or not you're going to change in some ways. I don't know. I don't care anything about it. I don't know. It's hard. Can you really accurately analyse yourself? It's always difficult to go: 'Oh, this is me and this isn't me.' But of course there's elements of yourself in every character. I think it is just you, really. I'm sorry. I honestly don't think about things that much. Well, you have very low standards. Ha ha ha ha ha. No, no, no, no, no. Who cares? Well, that's very sweet of you. We'll have tea sometime and we can talk about it. Yes. Oh no! Fuck no! You're just asking questions to which you know better answers. That's not the feeling that I'm getting from this . I wish I was because I'm sure it must feel nice. No, I don't. I think that sometimes maybe I feel like Santa Claus at a mall when a kid wants to take your picture. No, I'm thinking about the other night. I went to see this band and this guy came up and said: 'Oh, can I take a picture of you; I'm a real fan.' And I said: 'Look, man, I just got here, if it's OK, I don't wanna just walk in and take a picture – it'd make me feel awkward.' And he just turned and walked away, very angry at me. It didn't seem like it was someone you revere, it was more like I was some three-headed bullfrog they wanted to snap a picture of. I think that I'd actually prefer that but I'm just saying I don't have the experience of being treated with great reverence. Yeah, but I'd rather just be a fucking little Santa Claus than someone treated with some reverence. And by the way, that happens maybe once every 17 and a half years so it's not something that I deal with on a regular occurrence. I think part of it is you can either go places where that's bound to happen. And honestly I haven't been in that many successful movies. No, it's true! I'm not complaining. But it's funny you would ask about people talking to me with reverence because I don't really have that experience. No. Ah, who knows? Who? Oh yeah, the guy who invented the bicycle. I'm fucking with you. I'm sorry. Where are you from? . I just worked with Samantha Morton and you sound very like her. But she's not from London I think. Did I offend you by saying that? . However, I will say this, it think she was doing a bit of an accent. It's called Her [directed by Spike Jonze]. It hasn't come out yet. I think a proper path is subjective. I don't really believe in absolutes. There's not just one fucking proper path. Everyone has different need and different desire and different things they're trying to explore and understand; I don't think there is a proper path. But if there is and I'm wrong and you find out you better fucking call me and tell me I don't have any kind of guarantee about there being a proper path. Oh, come on, that's totally subjective. I don't know. You must understand I really don't read reviews or the press … I don't know what people will say in 20 years. I don't even know what they're saying about it now. I think in some ways the answer is yes. You work on something that you hope will maybe resonate for people at some point, but am I going to think about it for the next 20 years? No. There's no telling. They love and celebrate to people? There's nothing in particular I feel I want to say, and when I do I usually call one of my friends and that usually does the job. But if I have a need to, like, address maybe more than five people I'll give you a call. Yeah, I mean … I'm just whatever. I think sometimes doing interviews is very funny. And I'm happy because I'm going meet a friend and meet a fighter who I liked for a couple of years. So I'm excited. He's a mixed martial arts fighter. He does a particular form I really like and he's just really amazing and it's really exciting to watch him fight. I'm really sorry, I'm just too dim to have any sort of philosophical conversation. We should talk about Tabasco or something."
1547	1548	Cannes 2014: Snow in Paradise review - east London conversion, needs work 	" pair of petty criminals stand outside a high-end Hoxton cafe, peering through the glass at the macchiato drinkers. ""They ain't like you and me, bruv,"" grumbles chippy Dave (Frederick Schmidt) to his friend Tariq (Aymen Hamdouchi). He bangs on the glass, demanding to be noticed. ""Hey!"" he yells. ""We're here too, yeah?"" The loves august British directors like Mike Leigh and Ken Loach and is happy to grace them with Palme d'Or nominations. But Snow in Paradise, the feature debut of jobbing editor Andrew Hulme, positively revels in its illegitimate status (bypassed by UK funders; cobbled together on French and German money). Flawed but heartfelt, it spins a tale of social outcasts, of men who are increasingly at odds with a gentrified London; disgusted by the Tarquins and Jemimas who have colonised their neighbourhood and by the local boozers that have now gone organic. The film gatecrashes the festival in the Un Certain Regard sidebar. Hulme's drama is based on the life of Martin Askew, an east end hoodlum who later converted to Islam. Askew co-wrote the script and takes a supporting role as ""Uncle Jimmy"", who treats Dave as his errand boy. Disaster strikes and Tariq goes missing and a guilt-wracked Dave blunders into the mosque, in search of his friend or some solace; even he can't say for sure. He is torn between his vicious Uncle Jimmy and his smirking Uncle Mickey. Just possibly, however, there is a third way that he can go. The plot's a little shonky, the dialogue congeals and the film frequently falls prey to the sort of trippy, attention-seeking flourishes that Hulme would presumably have cut if he were editing any other movie than his own. All the same, there's something here. connects most effectively when it maintains a hard, straight trajectory. It also clears space for a brace of potent performances from newcomer Schmidt as the volatile hero and David Spinx as obsequious Uncle Mickey, who possesses a yellow smile and a cold blue stare. The old rogue sits in the greasy spoon, gazing at a ghastly reproduction that shows a fairytale cottage in an idyllic mountain meadow. ""Ah, the old days, Dave,"" he says with a sigh. Uncle Mickey can remember when Old Street roundabout was fields. I would have liked to have seen Hulme give more attention to Dave's religious conversion and a little less to the stock gangster showboating, if only because what he shows is so intriguing. We have the sense that Dave runs to Allah more out of anguish than interest - because he is broken and desperate and has nowhere left to turn. In this respect, the mosque (or the church) is not dissimilar to Robert Frost's marvellously jaded description of home. It's the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in."
1554	1555	Cannes acclaim for Steve Carell in Foxcatcher prompts Oscars tips 	"Nine years ago, Bennett Miller directed Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote, for which the late star went on to win a best actor Oscar. Critics at Cannes on Monday were tipping Miller to repeat the trick at next year's Academy Awards, following the first screening of his new movie, Foxcatcher – which features a radical change of pace for . Carell, best known for mainstream comedies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Crazy Stupid Love, plays John Eleuthere du Pont, an idiosyncratic multi-millionaire who bankrolled the US wrestling squad in the mid 1990s. With prosthetic nose, whittled eyebrows, yellowing teeth and glassy-eyed stare, Carell's du Pont is an oblique creep, a misguided patriot and a frustrated mummy's boy. Amid a shower of five star reviews, it was Carell's revelatory performance which drew the best notices. ""I've never seen Steve do anything that gave any material evidence he could do this,"" said Miller at a press conference following the screening. But a lunch with the actor convinced him. ""I knew that Steve could play awkward and eccentric but when I met him I realised how many layers there are, that he is one of these actors that has a public self and a private self – and you never see the private self, ever. And I thought those protected guarded areas of himself might relate to this character in some way."" Carell researched du Pont extensively, reading reams of material about the Pennsylvania dynasty of industrial tycoons and watching the documentaries they commissioned about themselves. Du Pont himself died in 2010, in the prison to which he was sent after his friendship with two Olympic-gold winning wrestling brothers, Mark (Channing Tatum) and Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) ended in tragedy. The director and stars spoke of their responsibility to the people still alive whose story is being told. ""I had free hand to a certain degree,"" said Carell. ""I watched as much as I could and read about him. But he wasn't sitting off camera watching me portray him."" The du Pont family themselves are not involved with the production, but Dave Schultz's widow, Nancy (played by in the film), was present for some of the shoot. Reliving such a difficult time was ""doubly awkward"" for Carell, he said, as he first met her while in character. ""It was incredibly emotional, obviously."" The film had been scheduled for release last autumn but was put back to this year, presumably to take advantage of a less crowded slate of awards contenders. It was financed by super-producer Megan Ellison, the daughter of Oracle corporation CEO Larry Ellison, who made her first press conference appearance in support of the film. seems to suggest that privilege breeds paranoia and that channelling hereditary wealth into passion projects can fail to satisfy. The leverage that du Pont's fortune offers him over those without funds creates a dangerous dynamic. ""There is a moral thrust of the story,"" said Ruffalo. ""[Which is] what happens to talent when it's for sale or can be acquired for a price and what happens to people when they're in a system that values almost anything at a price. That's modernity. There are some really talented people who can't really do what they do best in the world unless they can figure out a way how to monetise it. It costs them, and it costs their talent dear."" When Miller first read of the case, his first question was: ""What's the transaction, and how honest are they about it?"" But the film remains coy on the extent of the friendship between du Pont and the lunkish, vulnerable Mark, whom he headhunts then grooms for future sporting glory. The elder man is driven by what the press notes refer to as ""hidden needs"". His desire to impress his frosty mother, played by , is made explicit, but the exact nature of the two men's destructive relationship remains slippery. They progress from benefactor and protege to sparring partners to cocaine buddies who bond over their lonely childhoods and beta-male status. One scene shows them wrestling in the library at night, at du Pont's command and to Schultz's discomfort. ""There's a lot of American male repressed, non-communication happening in this film,"" Miller said. ""There's an undercurrent beneath the undercurrent. Every scene is just a tip of the iceberg."" He also declined to place the film in any wider context. ""It's not a political film [and] does not take a moral position. What happens is so bizarre and sometimes comical and ultimately tragic."" But although the film has comic moments, a key aspect of the central character is that he lacks both some degree of self-awareness – and a sense of humour. Miller recalled asking Carell whether he could imagine living without the latter, which the actor laughingly said he couldn't. Despite the highbrow acclaim, however, Carell said the genre of the film was not a consideration on set. ""It's the same approach. I don't think characters in film know if they're in a comedy or a drama. It was just a story."""
1555	1556	Robert Bresson 	"The image most associated with the French film director Robert Bresson, who has died aged 92, was that of an austere, pessimistic critic, a Jansenist at odds with the modern world. Living on the top floors of an elegant 17th-century building on the Ile St Louis in Paris, he was accused of an ivory tower existence outside the mainstream of cinema, refusing the slightest compromise. He declined to travel outside France, despised the publicity machine and, when awarded an ex-aequo prize at Cannes in 1981, refused to attend - leaving his admirer and co-recipient, Tarkovsky, to accept on his behalf. This was for L'Argent (1981), a masterpiece for which many French people never forgave him - critical, as it was, of their obsession with a second god, money. All of the above is part of the truth. But Bresson was grave not dour. He was unwilling to compromise only because he was secure in the belief - or knowledge - that his interior view of cinema had no application if modified. He was a proud man, but also the most singular of all directors, an indisputable cinematic genius whose comparatively modest output of one book, Notes On The Cinematographer, one comic short, Les Affaires Publiques (1934) and 13 features made between 1943 and 1981 carry a weight and influence belied by the mere 20 hours of screen time. He demanded ""not beautiful images, but necessary images"". The resulting body of work is rigorous, demanding and concentrated. He was the least bombastic of directors and the one for whom the word auteur is most apt. His films, from Les Anges Du Péché (1943) onwards, are instantly recognisable and constitute a pyramidic volume of work that is unique and unsurpassed. His refusal to compromise meant that projects and scripts remained unfilmed, and that producers and backers were difficult to find or hold on to. He never worked outside the cinema, and never taught or wrote for other people. Paradoxically, as purely a ""cinematographer"" - his word - he puts to shame the conventional aspects of movie-making. The austerity is most noticeable after the third film, Journal D'un Curé De Campagne (1950), when he finally rejected collaborators on his screenplays, never again used professional actors, eschewed the use of background music and used only one lens. In all but Lancelot Du Lac (1974) he relied on sparingly used classical music, normally integrated into the action and complex sounds. Bresson was born in Bromont-Lamothe. He studied Greek, Latin and philosophy and appears to have had a comfortable early life, of which - characteristically - little is known. After his first wife's death, he remarried. He aspired to be a painter, but said that this made him ""too agitated"". He is credited as a photographer, and two works were exhibited at the Barbican, in London, in the late 1980s. He was also an accomplished pianist, playing until he ""lost the nimbleness"" in his fingers. Music remained a dominant interest in his life and he believed that aspiring film-makers should study music, painting and poetry - and not attend film school. During the 1930s Bresson moved towards cinema and aimed at ""seeing everything"", with Charlie Chaplin a special favourite. He contributed to a screenplay, C'était Un Musicien (1933) and had contact with the director René Clair. He made a surreal comedy, Les Affaires Publiques, with backing from the art historian Roland Penrose. This oddity, starring a droll clown Bébé, was long suppressed, but he allowed two screenings during a season of his work at the National Film Theatre in London. Even then, he insisted that I introduce the programme and explain that - like his first two features - it was only there to ""complete the retrospective"". Only after he had served 18 months as a prisoner-of-war did Bresson's cinematic career really begin, with Les Anges Du Péché, set in a Dominican convent. It had some dialogue by Jean Giraudoux and a melodramatic story concerning two women, one the saintly Anne-Marie, the other a murderess, Thérèse. It was an extraordinary debut, unsensational, economical and serene. Although only a modest success, Bresson moved quickly to a second project - with dialogue by Jean Cocteau. This adaptation of a section from Diderot's Jacques Le Fataliste became Les Dames Du Bois De Boulogne, again with music by Jean-Jacques Grunenwald and using established actors. The story concerned a woman's intended revenge on the lover who had rejected her. Told simply it sounds like a Sirkian melodrama, but the film had a cool elegance and the timeless quality that marked most of the later work. Bresson waited several years before realising the project that established him as the foremost French director of the next three decades. Based on a novel by Bernanos, Journal D'un Curé De Campagne (1950) was awarded the Venice Film Festival Golden Lion and became a commercial success. This was his last use of Grunenwald and any professional actors. Subsequently, he cast by face, gesture and even by voice over the telephone. In 1956 Bresson made the film that became - and remained - his greatest popular success, Un Condamné à Mort S'est Echappé (A Man Escapes). This masterpiece concerns the true story of the escape by a French prisoner-of-war from a Nazi stronghold. The achievement becomes, in Bresson's hand, a miraculous journey and the most jubilant testimony to faith in all cinema. The blend of documentary realism and the director's insistence that the story has ""no embellishments"" is a wonderful contrast to its interior passion and complexity. Although life for Bresson never became easy, this success led to six features in the following 15 years - Pickpocket (1959), Le Procès De Jeanne d'Arc (1961), Au Hasard, Balthazar (1966), Mouchette (1969) and his first films in colour, Une Femme Douce (1969) and Quatre Nuits D'un Reveur (1971), the last two taken from Dostoevsky. Bresson's first use of Dostoevsky was more obliquely in Pickpocket, where the inspiration is Crime And Punishment. The film of Joan's trial is based on the actual transcripts of the period. His masterpiece Balthazar, ostensibly about a donkey, is rare for its circular movement, rather than his usual linear approach. Mouchette, another country-set story - Bresson moved confidently between rural and urban settings - also derives from a Bernanos novel. It is a severe, majestic work with a final suicide that results from an unsentimen talised accumulation of suffering and despair. In 1974, Bresson completed a long cherished project. Once planned as an English-based film, Lancelot Du Lac was reissued in 1994 and still looked years ahead of its time, with its timeless quality and its concern with spirituality and earthliness. He followed this classical work with his most controversial one, Le Diable, Probablement (1977), inspired by a newspaper report of a student who committed suicide by proxy - paying another boy to shoot him. Bresson parallels the suicide with a materialist rush to oblivion that he foresaw in the modern world. The French resented the implicit criticism - as they did in L'Argent, the film which Bresson once said gave him the ""most pleasure"". This final masterpiece proved to be his last film, although all the works continued - and continue - to be revived and reissued. In 1986 his logbook of discoveries was published, and remains for me the best book on cinema ever written. Bresson's reputation has never faltered, and Jean-Luc Godard's comparisons with Dostoevsky and Mozart have been echoed a thousand times. He was a man of unfailing courtesy, happily receiving guests at his Paris apartment (but never at his retreat at Epernon) and sending handwritten notes in reply to any question or concern. David Thomson wrote that Bresson's films ""surpass beauty, in both intention and effect, and stress necessity"". His fine essay echoes Bresson's own words, asking for ""nothing too much, nothing deficient"". His genius was in combining that lack of surface bombast with an interior complexity of unsurpassed richness. In recent years Bresson's reputation has continued to grow, thanks to the reissue of several films, the adulation of fellow film-makers and the publication of innumerable articles and books. Earlier this year, the Cinematique Ontario initiated a complete retrospective using new prints, which was repeated at the Edinburgh Film Festival and London's National Film Theatre to capacity audiences. He is survived by his second wife, Marie-Madeleine.  Robert Bresson, film director, born September 25 1907; died December 18 1999"
1557	1558	All on a summer's day 	awel Pawlikowski, the Polish-born documentarist now based in Britain, made an impression four years ago with his feature film, Last Resort. Its urgent subject was the way we treat immigrants and asylum seekers and it took a despairing view of their plight. His new film, My Summer of Love, seemingly turns away from pressing topical concerns, the title suggesting a romantic idyll which in some sense it is. At the centre are two teenage girls, the middle-class, boarding school-educated Tamsin (Emily Blunt), and the working-class Mona (Nathalie Press), who meet one hot summer's day in the fields outside a small Yorkshire town. This opening is pastoral, bucolic. Mona, a pale, freckled redhead with a certain resemblance to the young Tilda Swinton, is lying in the faded grass, beside the red Honda motorbike she's just bought. It cost £10 because it does not have an engine. She looks up at the sky which, in its flat whiteness, resembles the sur face of a lake. Suddenly above her rears a horse and Pawlikowski cuts between close-ups of her left eye and the enormous right eye of the horse. Confidently riding the horse is the beautiful, dark-haired Tamsin. From this casual encounter an intense friendship develops. The setting is almost abstract, an unnamed town in a narrow valley through which a train passes on an embankment above the streets but never stops. Tamsin lives in a secluded, ivy-covered mansion with her father, a remote figure, rarely seen, who drives a maroon Jaguar. Her sister, she explains, has died of anorexia and her mother is an actress on tour. Mona, an orphan, lives in a cluttered room above a pub that has been closed down by her older brother, Phil (Paddy Considine). He's a violent ex-criminal who has become a born-again Christian in jail and uses the ground floor as a meeting place for his devout circle. Tamsin is a gifted cello player, self-consciously sophisticated, urging Mona to understand the world by reading Nietzsche and Freud and proclaims that Edith Piaf 'had such a wonderfully tragic life'. She's manipulative and a self-confessed fantasist. Mona, on the other hand, is a forthright girl with a cheeky sense of humour (she does a splendid impersonation of Linda Blair in The Exorcist), a strong local accent and no experience of life beyond this small community. Her romantic yearnings are tempered by a knowledge that ahead of her is a predictable future leading up to menopause and death. Both girls seem alienated from their families and backgrounds and each provides things the other needs. Tamsin buys an engine for Mona's Honda so they can go on jaunts together. The relationship suggests two very different works about class, alienation, and destructive passion - Jean Genet's The Maids and LP Hartley's The Go-Between. Their friendship develops into love of both a spiritual and physical kind - first a kiss while swimming in a brook on the moors, then a more passionate embrace on a neglected grass tennis court and finally full consummation. This escalation is handled with tenderness and subtlety. A tough humour informs the accompanying folie à deux by which the pair exact cruel comic revenge on Tamsin's father for his adulterous liaison and on Mona's brutal married lover for having deserted her. They then turn on Mona's brother, Phil, to expose the supposed hypocrisy that has led him and his followers to erect a giant cross on a hill above the town, announcing their mission to save its benighted citizens. My Summer of Love has a characteristically dangerous performance from and remarkable performances from Nathalie Press and Emily Blunt, who bring a wonderful naturalness and conviction to Mona and Tamsin. They recall the striking debuts of Samantha Morton and Emily Watson in the 1990s. The picture is conventionally resolved, though not unsatisfactorily, and is oddly mysterious in its tone and thrust. Is it a psychological drama involving social and sexual rites of passage? Or is the film a kind of allegory about the impossibility of sustaining the emotional intensity necessary to break away from the moral numbness of contemporary Britain?
1567	1568	Tommy Lee Jones on The Homesman: 'It's a consideration of American imperialism' 	"Actor-director Tommy Lee Jones said that his new film, The Homesman, set during the mid-19th century western expansion of the United States, was about ""American imperialism"" across the continent. Speaking to journalists at the after the world premiere screening, he said: ""I won't try to hide the fact that a consideration of American imperialism on the west side of the Mississippi river is the film's underlying theme."" He added: ""[The film] is a consideration of the history of western expansion; a way of looking at what the schoolchildren of America learn when the subject of manifest destiny comes up."" ""Manifest destiny"" is the term used to describe the doctrine held by European settlers to the US that they held a natural (and divine) right to move west and occupy the remaining land, resulting in long-running conflict with and large-scale alterations to the natural landscape. tells the story of religious homesteader Mary Bee Cuddy (played by Hilary Swank) who hires ""homesman"" George Briggs (Jones) to help her transport three mentally-ill women away from their hardscrabble lives on the frontier back east to the care of a cleric in Iowa. It is Jones' fourth credit as director, and his second film at Cannes after The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada in 2005, which won best actor (for Jones) and best screenplay (for Guillermo Arriaga). Though the film – and the 1988 novel by Glendon Swarthout that it is adapted from – would appear to be firmly placed within the western genre, Jones said he ""didn't think about"" the term; preferring to describe The Homesman as ""a film about American history"". At one point in the film Swank and Jones' characters are confronted by a Pawnee raiding party and have a horse stolen, but Jones rejected any suggestion that he had ""stereotyped"" Native Americans in his film. ""I don't have any concerns about that whatsoever. The actors were all Native Americans of Pueblo descent … I was proud they were looked like Pawnees, and not ashamed of the fact they were considered by our characters potentially to be homicidal. We're not bending the truth, or stereotyping anybody. That's the last thing we want to do."" Despite the classic American themes, The Homesman still faced a struggle to get made, as production was only able to begin after receiving the backing of French indie powerhouse Europa Corp, headed by Luc Besson. Producer Michael Ftizgerald said: ""We would never have got this picture made in [the Hollywood] system. If we hadn't gone to Luc Besson we would not be here. It's indefensible."""
1569	1570	The Homesman review – Tommy Lee Jones isn’t quite what a feminist looks like 	irector, star and co-writer Tommy Lee Jones’s earthy adaptation of Glendon Swarthout’s novel has been hailed in some quarters as a groundbreaking “feminist western”. In concentrating primarily on the trials and fortitudes of Hilary Swank’s Mary Bee Cuddy, it certainly overturns some of the genre’s macho stereotypes – initially at least. When three variously traumatised women require transportation from Nebraska to Iowa in the unforgiving 1850s, it falls to Mary Bee to escort them to safety, an act of both altruism and self-determination. Heading east, she encounters dangling wretch George Briggs (Jones), whose gruffly reluctant help she duly enlists. Habitually rebuffed for being “as plain as an old tin pail”, Mary Bee is in need of a man and the irascible Briggs seems to her as good a choice as any (“we make a good team”), despite his growling wounded-bear hostility. Imposingly shot by Rodrigo Prieto, this chilly tale of 19th-century endurance has true grit under its fingernails and the dirt of the midwest on its boot-heels, the craggy landscape of Jones’s fiercely bewhiskered saddlebag face melding with the harsh beauty of the American terrain. As with , Jones’s direction has an Eastwood-esque confidence and simplicity that gets the best from his cast. Swank is outstanding as Mary Bee, the tough former teacher making her way in a man’s world, flintily determined to build a family home despite constant rejection by men, none of whom is her equal. A shame, then, that the narrative should contrive to lynch her independence, the film refocusing on the altogether less interesting Briggs after a firelight scene of hoary “have your cake and eat it” misjudgment. The result is infuriatingly conflicted fare, buoyed up by brilliant performances, weighed down by old-school cliche, leavened by the bleak plains over which it casts its lonely, misanthropic eye.
1570	1571	Tommy Lee Jones – ‘Women are objectified and trivialised because of their gender’ 	 strides into the room and is, for a moment, unrecognisable. The hair is neatly combed and he wears a grey pinstriped suit with a blue shirt and tie, black socks, black brogues and distinct air of civility. He could be an accountant. Or, even more heretically, an English gentleman. He has just returned to California after a stint filming in London and the place seems to have rubbed off on him. “I’m very comfortable in London,” he says. “I lived for about five weeks in a house in Chapel Street in Belgravia.” He pronounces it Belgraahvia, suggesting cocktail evenings with posh folk in the embassy district. “I enjoy the island. I have long, enduring relationships with people there.” Jones makes a cheerful confession. “Actually, by now I’ve got a tailor on Savile Row.” He plucks at his lapels. “This one was not made there but all my suits in the future will be made on that street. It feels kind of nice.” He grins. “I’m kind of pleased with myself that I’ve got a tailor on Savile Row. I’m 68 years old. I deserve it.” For an actor seldom seen out of jeans and boots, and best known for playing badass lawmen and killers in the darkest corners of America’s psyche, the role of English gent seems incongruous, and the illusion duly dissolves. As the sun sets over Hollywood, casting shadows across the Beverly Hills hotel room, Jones sprawls on a sofa, orders sake and spends the next hour showing why he is one of the most interesting, revered and feared figures on the cultural landscape. There is the face. A craggy, weathered testament to the elements that could stop a clock. There are the black eyes, once compared to tiny oil wells, and the massive, leathery hands that erupt from his sleeves. There is the voice, a crackling instrument coated with the dust and twang of an an eighth-generation Texan. And there is the flinty personality, sharp, jagged, unyielding. Jones won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1993 for playing the relentless marshall who pursues Harrison Ford in The Fugitive, but also etched his mark playing a sheriff in , Agent K in the , murderer Gary Gilmore in The Executioner’s Song, and a grieving father investigating troubled Iraq war veterans in . Some think his abolitionist congressman Thaddeus Stevens, an Oscar-nominated role, stole from Daniel Day-Lewis. There is a sandblasted rawness few others match because Jones is that rare thing, an authentic loner. His intensity imbues roles with a moral compass even when playing the bad guy. None of which really prepares you for his latest incarnation: the quasi-feminist. Jones has directed, co-written and stars in a subversive western, , which explores the female condition in the frontier harshness of 1850s Nebraska. Hilary Swank plays a resilient, lonely singleton who enlists Jones’s crabby claims jumper to help her escort three mentally ill women back to civilisation. “Our film is the inverse of the conventional western,” says Jones. “It’s about women, not men; it’s about lunatics, not heroes; they’re travelling east, not west; and we have a different perspective on what has come to be called manifest destiny.” The film, his fourth as a director, veers between brutality, black comedy and compassion. It has won . It has also swung a lantern over forbidden terrain: Jones’s personal beliefs. In , based on Glendon Swarthout’s novel, he has put female suffering and fortitude at the heart of a quintessentially masculine genre. Sexist injustice, he says, continues to this day. “I don’t think there’s a woman in the readership of the Guardian, not one, who hasn’t been objectified or trivialised because of her gender at one time or another. And that’s really what our movie is about.” So is it a feminist movie? A pause. He chooses his words carefully. “It would not be unfair to call it that but I’m not looking for labels.” It seems he will elaborate but doesn’t. A prolonged silence ensues. No, Jones does not look for labels. And if he thinks he detects one lobbed in the guise of a question about his personal convictions, those black eyes petrify it mid-flight with a basilisk glower. The son of an oil driller and beauty shop owner has a bookish, cerebral streak that won him a scholarship to a Dallas prep school and Harvard, where he roomed with Al Gore and obtained a BA in English literature, writing his senior thesis on the mechanics of Catholicism in Flannery O’Connor’s books. But apart from , the cowboy of the new west, as he has been dubbed, has masked his political beliefs. Liberal or conservative, libertarian or paternalistic, doveish or hawkish, it has never been clear. Jones detests intrusion into what he considers his private sphere. He once alluded to a “psychically horrifying” childhood defined by drunken parental arguments, but it was fleeting public candour. His three marriages, 3,000-acre ranch outside San Antonio and passion for polo remain off-limits topics. He maintains opacity with legendary brusqueness – some say bullying - which has intimidated peers, fans and interviewers alike, reducing some to tears. Sting, who worked with him on Stormy Monday, called him “monstrous”. Jim Carrey, his Batman Forever co-star, said he “scared the hell out of me”. Questions he dislikes, such as whether he believes in aliens, or his friendship with Gore, can prompt walkouts or overturned furniture. His scowling visage during a Golden Globes ceremony . Like his character Harvey “Two-Face” Dent in Batman, Jones is condemned to duality: he scorns the celebrity game with acidic disdain yet must play it, up to a point, to promote his work. “There are certain contractual obligations and one does the best that one can do,” he says stiffly when I ask about press interviews. It is a cue for him to drain his sake and take a refill. When he ordered the bottle I had hoped sharing a drink might stoke conviviality but as the interview wears on it is clear the booze is to sustain him through the ordeal. Since he’s promoting a film that is a labour of love and potential Oscar contender, Jones does his best to be polite. The herculean effort wreaks a toll. As one question follows another he fidgets, criss-crosses legs, examines my phone, broods, winces, tugs his hair, yanks it up, then down, then to the side, momentarily creating a mad professor effect which would be funny were it not for the death stare. With foreboding I edge on to forbidden terrain. The film takes a bleak view of US expansionism, depicting some pioneers as cheats, brutes and bandits, I say. He nods. “It’s about people living on the cutting edge of what is sometimes called manifest destiny. What is the price we pay for believing that God meant for us to own everything between Massachusetts and California? People still believe it, and schoolchildren are still taught that there is almost a divine right for the United States to hold the land that it does today.” If the story’s feminist angle has contemporary resonance, I ask, might there be also be a resonance in relation to US foreign policy post 9/11? The voice lowers and he leans forward to emphasise each word: “I did not come here to talk about US foreign policy in the Middle East, and I will not do it.” The Texan twang vapourises other efforts to elicit opinion. Of US voters’ midterm gloominess: “I’m not going to make a broad political statement. There are some discouraging headlines in newspapers.” Of border control and immigration reform – a topic in , which he directed in 2005: “There seems to be a lot of people worried about it.” Of global warming – an intriguing topic since but also made an eco-minded expedition to Antarctica – he says only: “I think any thinking person should be worried about climate change.” I mention a scene in that feels allegorical: his character, George Briggs, burns down a hotel along with its rapacious owner, played by James Spader. Jones nods. A commentary, perhaps, on capitalism? He evades the question with a discourse on frontier business practices. Pressed, he replies: “It speaks well for the movie that you’re thinking about these things.” As a Dubliner I ask why Spader’s character was Irish. Jones answers by asking whether I believed the accent. In truth I found it a bit shamrocky Oirish but mumble it was fine. Jones nods, approving. “I think Jimmy is a wonderful actor. He’s a good pal.” Another friend and collaborator, Oliver Stone, has expressed interest in making a documentary about Vladimir Putin. If it were a biopic I ask who should play Russia’s president. “I don’t know who in the hell would play that guy.” How about you? “No.” Why not? “He’s a Russian.” But it could be shot in English. “You think so? Hm. I don’t know anything about him.” Jones seems about to close the topic, then muses on the notion. “He seems to be somewhat ... malevolent. But I don’t know anything about him, much, other than I don’t trust him.” Jones praises Stone, who directed him in JFK. “I have the highest respect for Oliver. I would be really interested to see a screenplay at any time. Anything of his work would be of interest to me.” Asked about other peers he admires he turns coy. “I don’t want to start naming names of living American directors because I’ll leave someone out and they’re friends.” He does, however, observe that with the exception of the Coen brothers’ No Country for Old Men and , which he directed, Hollywood has bungled adapting the novels of his friend Cormac McCarthy. “I don’t think he’s been served very well by the movies so far.” , directed by John Hillcoat, was not entirely successful, he says. Out of the blue he actually chuckles – a pleasant, gurgling sound, let history record – when I ask about him and McCarthy being dubbed “the Texas apocalypse intellectuals” for weaving big, dark themes with American west narrative. “Really? Where did you hear that?” (A ). The idea amuses until I make the mistake of asking if it’s a fair moniker. Instantly he bristles. The English lit grad senses a cousin of label. “I would object to any moniker.” Two years shy of 70, Jones confesses to insecurity about job offers, saying he hopes to be able to continue acting, writing and directing. “I don’t want to end my career.” Action roles show no sign of drying up. In London he was shooting Criminal, a thriller with Ryan Reynolds, Gary Oldman and Kevin Costner. In January he will be in Thailand starring with Jason Statham in Mechanic: Resurrection. There is one area which holds little appeal for the great grouch: television. The small screen’s supposed golden age of The Sopranos, Mad Men, Breaking Bad and True Detective is passing him by, and that’s just fine. “I probably watch less than one hour of television a week. And when I do watch television it’s usually a football game. Sometimes I’ll watch a news broadcast for a few minutes. Otherwise I don’t have time.” Directors such as Steven Soderbergh, Cary Fukunaga and Jonathan Demme have migrated to television, as have actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson and Sean Bean, but Jones is in no rush to follow. As a director he is fanatical about capturing a certain look and television, he feels, is a medium of compromise. “Most of those things are so poorly lit. And they are limited a lot by their tight schedules. They have to shoot so much material and they have to shoot it so fast.” He shakes his head, appalled at the cinematographic sins. “The lighting is often rather ...” He pauses, searching for the right word. “Gross.” The interview ends. Jones exhales, smooths his hair, rises and stretches. A luminous moon hangs over Hollywood. We shake hands. A parting question. Has he ever enjoyed an interview? “Oh yeah, sure.” Any one in particular? A pause. “No.” The Homesman is released in the UK on 21 November
1571	1572	Cannes review: Lost River - Ryan Gosling flounders with directorial debut 	"For ""River"" read ""Opportunity"" or ""Any Sense Of Proportion Or Humility"" or maybe just ""Mind"". Everyone knows that superstar success means that you are surrounded by people who don't say no to you. Perhaps the actor Ryan Gosling has been asking everyone if he should write and direct a movie influenced by David Lynch and . Having been answered enthusiastically in the affirmative - the same response might have met a plan to open a restaurant or market a brand of mango chutney - Gosling has made his helmer's debut. The result clunks. It is colossally indulgent, shapeless, often fantastically and unthinkingly offensive and at all times insufferably conceited. Yet it is frustrating precisely because it sometimes isn't so bad. There is something in there somewhere - striking images and moments, and the crazy energy of a folie de grandeur. is a kind of ruin-porn gothic fantasy, set among the abandoned buildings of Detroit - although the title is in fact the name of a fictional town. (Perhaps it should be said that ruin porn here also means porn among the ruins: objectification of women in a decaying urban environment.) plays a woman called Billy. Matt Smith plays a man called Bully. (I half expected Joanna Lumley to come on playing someone called Bolly.) Billy is an attractive single mom with a toddler and also a teenage son called Bones (Iain De Castecker) who roams around looting the wrecked houses for scrap metal, which brings him into conflict with Bully, a psycho tough guy who thinks he rules this desolate zone. Billy is behind with the mortgage payments, so her sinister bank manager, Dave (nicely played by Ben Mendelsohn), offers her a job in a bizarre club he runs, with freaky cabaret acts based on torture and mutilation. Meanwhile, Bones falls in love with the girl next door, played by Saoirse Ronan, who is called Rat, because of her pet rat. Benoit Debie's cinematography is impressive and so is Lon Bender's sound design. There are touches of early David Gordon Green – although Green always knew the value of restraint: Gosling gorges himself and us on images. The movie is choked with them – and choked on its own portentousness. The movie's problem is that it tries to have its bizarre cake and eat it. Having placed us in a horrible and patently unreal nightmare world, Gosling also appears to want points for being concerned about real issues, such as communities being abandoned by the recession. Its faults are huge: its virtues less so – but they are there. Gosling has energy and appetite. There is a delirious buzz to the drama. It is often ridiculous and fatuous but often ingenious. It could yet be that Gosling will mature as a director."
1582	1583	Film review: The Road 	"Cormac McCarthy's almost unbearably disturbing 2006 novel about the post-apocalyptic journey of a father and son across a desolate America has now been adapted for the screen and, for this eminently respectful version, director John Hillcoat has effected a guarded change of emphasis. Like an orchestra conductor dampening down the ominous blasts of timpani and brass, while urging more from his emotion-twisting string section, Hillcoat has intensified the heartrending poignancy, while deflecting our   attention from the horror. Readers of McCarthy's book know that it is the depictions of cannibalism in this lawless future-world which provide its deepest shocks. The man and his boy chance upon a secluded country home containing a locked basement horrifically packed with naked prisoners being ""farmed"" as food for their captors. Later, we find the remains of an infant's corpse, apparently once ready to be eaten by its desperate parents. The second of these events is tactfully omitted from the film, and the first, I felt, had its impact marginally reduced. Hillcoat uses voiceover, which has a calming, distancing function, no matter what revulsions are being described. This is undoubtedly a serious, powerful, well-acted movie, but I can't fully share the critical enthusiasm it has widely gained elsewhere because of what seemed to me its fractional reluctance to confront the nightmare fully, though what Joe Penhall's adaptation arguably does is import into the body of the movie a premonition of the unexpectedly redemptive and gentle tone in McCarthy's final pages. plays the nameless ""Man"" struggling across this blasted, hellish landscape with his son. The America they knew has been destroyed by an unexplained environmental catastrophe. The mother of his child (Charlize Theron) has deserted them, although the question of blame has been rendered all but meaningless by this overwhelming calamity, smashing the concepts of moral behaviour. The boy, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, is about 10 years old; his father could almost be any age from 45 to 60. He is bearded, dirty, careworn, and his features and body made gaunt and hard with hunger, sleeplessness and fear. They stumble into the wrecked, deserted supermarkets that are a staple of this kind of story, and even trudge through piles of banknotes: now just useless trash, of course. (Hillcoat actually makes them $100 bills, which I think is overegging it a little.) The two of them are cold all of the time, though the father is capable of almost superhuman efforts to conquer their hardship: at one point he swims into an icy sea in an attempt to scavenge supplies from a wrecked ship. They are on continuous alert against the marauding gangs of predators who want to kill, imprison or eat them. The father and son can trust no one and Mortensen has relentlessly drilled into the boy the need to guard against the ""bad guys"", although this has triggered in his son a converse fear that they are becoming the bad guys themselves. He is becoming what passes for a moral conscience in this shattered world, and is perhaps evolving into a sacrificial infant-god. Yet they do have encounters with people who are not obvious enemies: a near-blind old man, played by Robert Duvall, and an unhappy thief, played by Michael K Williams (The Wire's Omar Little). The two push their tattered possessions and what scraps of food they have in a shopping trolley, emphasising a weird, subliminal resemblance to De Sica's Bicycle Thieves. By far their most precious possession is their gun, which has just two bullets left. When the time comes, the father knows he must steel himself to kill his boy and then himself. If they have to fire the gun in self-defence, it seriously limits their ultimate double-exit strategy. Apocalyptic movies come into three categories: ""This isn't really going to happen"", ""What if this really happened?"" and ""This is really going to happen"". Roland Emmerich's 2012 comes into the first group, Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men into the second, and Michael Haneke's Time of the Wolf the third. The Road straddles the last two categories, although even Haneke had nothing to compare with the chilling horror of that gun-dilemma in The Road. On the screen, just as on the page, it grips and horrifies because it is so stunningly real. If the end came, and we had to struggle on into a nightmarish world, fearing the living and envying the dead, then suicide would be the only thing on anyone's mind, an option assessed and deferred hour by hour, moment by moment. It doesn't bear thinking about, and to do Hillcoat's film justice, it does think about it, although the greater emphasis is elsewhere – on the heartrending loneliness of father and son, an unholy trinity of loneliness. The father can't confide in his son; the boy cannot explain his terrors to his father, and the pair of them are utterly alone in this abysmal cosmic wasteland. It is an inexpressibly painful subject and Hillcoat has brought it to the screen with great intelligence."
1588	1589	Cannes 2012: Why have no female film directors been nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes? 	"Cannes' fabled Croisette promenade was dotted with the customary festival starlets in high heels and glamorous dresses yesterday afternoon. But just behind them, a feminist uprising of sorts was in full swing. Inside a landmark hotel on the seafront strip in the South of France, loud calls for positive discrimination in favour of women's films were being voiced. The impact of British director Andrea Arnold's public anger about the failure to include a female director in the prestigious Palme D'Or line-up continues to stir controversy at the annual celebration of world cinema. Speakers at a Beyond Borders diversity symposium echoed Arnold's complaint that while films from around the globe may have made the shortlist for the annual prize, directors drawn from half of the population have been ignored. At the opening of the festival on Wednesday the acclaimed director of and , who this year sits on the Palme D'Or jury alongside Ewan McGregor, said that the lack of women in the selection was ""a great pity and a great disappointment"", adding that it reflected badly on the film industry. On the beach this weekend after the premiere of the British film, Broken, Arnold was unrepentant, although still limited by the Cannes convention of jury ""purdah"". ""I wanted to put it out there,"" she said. ""I don't want to see positive discrimination at Cannes though. I don't think any director should be included because of who they are."" The allegation that unworthy films made by directors from the developing world, or from conflict zones, are included in the Cannes jury's selection in spite of their low quality was dismissed by Arnold. ""That is only one reading of what happens. I would say instead that the jury includes films that are political and have something to say,"" she said. The lack of a film directed by a woman on the list of 22 in contention this year has provoked fiery debate across France. As the festival opened the newspaper carried a protest letter from the feminist collective which was signed by notable French female film-makers, including Virginie Despentes, Coline Serreau and Fanny Cottençon. ""Men love their women to have depth, but only when it comes to their cleavage,"" the letter argued. The row comes at a time when the commercial success of films aimed at women is evident. The box office appeal of Kristen Wiig in the comedy and of the Thatcher biopic , described on Friday by its British producer Damian Jones as a ""mother and daughter film that brought in the whole family"", have reached huge neglected audiences. But while there are few women directors, there is an increasing female presence behind the scenes in Britain. BBC Films and Film4 are both run by women and at least three of the producers who have managed to bring British productions to premiere in Cannes this summer are female. Nira Park, the producer of hits such as , has brought out the Ben Wheatley film , while Rebecca O'Brien has brought Ken Loach's Palme D'Or contender and Dixie Linder has brought , the first film from British theatre director Rufus Norris. ""Gender is not part of how I see things when I look for a director,"" said Linder this weekend after the film opened the festival's Critic's Week programme. ""In fact I feel that positive discrimination could actually be detrimental. Certainly if they had chosen my film for Cannes simply because I was a woman producer, I would not like it."" Linder, whose film stars Tim Roth alongside 12-year-old newcomer Eloise Laurence, added that in her experience finding finance for a film directed by a newcomer such as Norris, despite his theatrical record, was more difficult than for a more established woman director, such as Sam Taylor Wood. Christine Langan, the creative head of BBC Films, said that Britain was lucky to have several strong female directors but that it is unfair to expect them to deliver Palme D'Or prospects every year. ""While people like and Lynne Ramsay are fantastic role models, their rate of film-making would have to increase considerably to create a steady flow of competitors to Cannes,"" she said. ""I would love to feel that no girl growing up today should think that it is something she could not do, but I don't approach it from a gender point of view. You get very embroiled in each film project and while BBC Films likes to encourage female talent, I am really focused on the quality of the production and so become fairly blind to gender."" Until this year it had looked as if everything was moving towards greater balance, both at Cannes and in the wider the film industry. Not only did Kathryn Bigelow win the first directing Oscar for a woman with The Hurt Locker in 2010, but there were four women directors in the line-up of 18 films competing for the top prize at Cannes last summer: the Australian Julia Leigh, Japanese director Naomi Kawase, the French actress and writer Maïwenn Le Besco and Ramsay, the Scottish director selected for . And yet the only woman to win the award in 65 years remains , who received the Palme D'Or in 1993 for . Three years ago Campion's first new film for nine years, , about the poet John Keats, was included in the main competition and the director used the platform to criticise the continued dearth of female directors. ""The studio system is kind of an old boys' system and it's difficult for them to trust women to be capable,"" she said at the time. But Campion also suggested that there were reasons linked more closely to gender, saying: ""I think women don't grow up with the harsh world of criticism that men grow up with – we are more sensitively treated – and when you first experience the world of film-making you have to develop a very tough skin."" For fellow New Zealand-born director Regan Hall his own gender has not hindered his approach to his first feature, , a female-centred story about British relay athletes to be released next month before the London olympics. ""I have never felt that I wasn't qualified,"" he said. ""I have done a lot of filming with women because I have worked in fashion and it never crossed my mind that a woman should be making this film."" He added that historically women had developed expertise in other areas of film-making, such as editing, continuity and styling. ""There is something about being a director that means I can understand why more men do it,"" he said. ""There are different personality types involved. But I do think that the best way to encourage women is probably to look at a role model and in New Zealand we certainly have a good one with Jane Campion."""
1596	1597	Tommy Lee Jones: the man is back 	ommy Lee Jones's natural gaze is a death stare. When he's talking, when he's listening, when he's waiting for you to compose yourself after his latest barb, his eyes will not leave yours. He doesn't give interviews that often, and when he does, he evidently sees them as opportunities to confirm his reputation for eating journalists alive. The press needn't take it personally, however, since co-workers and family have confessed to similar experiences. Sting, who worked with him on Stormy Monday, has called him 'monstrous'. Jim Carrey, his co-star in Batman Returns, said he 'scared the hell out of me'; director Joel Schumacher proclaimed him 'a bully'; and even his second wife, Kimberlea, once admitted she was afraid of him when they met. He is here to promote his blockbuster comedy Men In Black II, but humour is not on the immediate agenda. He takes no prisoners, and no bullshit, either. So I sit opposite this steely man in a solicitor's suit and quickly lose the staring contest. 'Lots of people seem to be scared of you,' I say, walking straight into the lion's den. 'Journalists tell me that often.' 'Does it bother you that people are afraid of you?' 'No'. 'Maybe it's useful,' I suggest. 'I don't know if it's useful or not. But I'm sorry to hear that,' he adds, faux-apologetically, 'because it gets boring.' is living up to his legend and loving it. Perversely, I am loving it, too. Jones was never going to be an easy customer, and this tough unpredictability is what makes him, at 55, one of the best actors in Hollywood. When he played Harvey Two-Face in Batman Returns - a character whose head and temperament are split in two by acid, simultaneously Jekyll and Hyde - it wasn't his best performance but was, perhaps, the most literal self-description, since Jones's greatest cinematic virtue is to always appear to be a double. Early in his career, in 1978, he made The Eyes of Laura Mars terrifying because he played the most trustworthy character who turned into the most dangerous. The plot relied on both the heroine (Faye Dunaway) and the viewers putting their faith in him, so that the finale was felt to be not only murderous but also a betrayal. Much later, in The Fugitive, for which he won an Oscar in 1994, he was the US marshal who refused to abandon a dogged search for the convicted killer played by Harrison Ford. But he was also the only character who believed Ford might be innocent. When they meet face to face, and Ford tells him he didn't kill his wife, Jones replies: 'I don't care.' Jones wrote that line himself. At the end of the movie, in the police car, Jones removes Ford's handcuffs. 'I thought you didn't care,' Ford tells him. Jones laughs, in the last few minutes and for the first time, and says: 'Don't tell anyone, OK?' His character's heroism lies in being able to offer the benefit of the doubt, and the triumph of Jones's acting - not just in this performance but also in his screen persona as a whole - is to show that you can never trust what you think you know, and that appearances are deceptive by necessity. Many of his roles haven't been quite so ambiguous, however, and Jones has made a career out of playing complicated, unpleasant characters. He was Lee Harvey Oswald's oily co-conspirator in Oliver Stone's JFK, the film that put him back in the spotlight after a decade doing TV. He played the fast-talking, foul-mouthed prison warden in Stone's Natural Born Killers. He shone as Ty Cobb, the misanthropic baseball player. He is the only mainstream Hollywood actor to have portrayed the legendarily difficult Howard Hughes. And he won an Emmy in 1982 for playing the murderer Gary Gilmore in The Executioner's Song, scripted by Norman Mailer. I ask what drew him to these anti-heroes. 'You know, I don't really think you have to play nice guys.' 'Do you think niceness is overrated?' 'No. Not at all. Niceness - does that mean politeness?' 'Politeness, kindness...' 'Kindness and politeness are not overrated at all. They're underused.' Just then, I think I detect the barest hint of a smile. Jones was brought up to be polite, to call people 'Ma'am' and 'Sir'. This lends an odd formality to his diction, which, if you know him from his work, can feel like the clipped pronouncements of an officer of the law, but which, to judge from his life, is probably nothing more than the gentility of a Southerner. He was born in 1946 in San Saba, Texas - three miles, he says, from where he lives now. His father worked on an oil field, and his mother, a beautician, became the first policewoman in Midland, Texas. They argued and drank and divorced and remarried; some nights they would take Tommy, their only child, to honky tonk bars and leave him in the car. His second wife was once quoted as saying his childhood had been 'psychically horrifying', and if guests came to stay, Tommy would pack a suitcase and try to leave with them. When he was 13, his father took a job in Libya, and Tommy won a football scholarship to a fancy school in Dallas. 'I was intimidated by the environment,' he says. The teacher who wrote his school report that year described him as 'sullen, morose and belligerent'. 'And, uh,' he reflects now, 'it's probably a generous description - of my character at the time.' Prep school led to Harvard, where he was a star of the American football team and played, aptly enough, the position of 'offensive guard'. His room-mate was Al Gore, with whom he remains friends, and whose political campaigns he has supported ever since. Jones did a good deal of acting, and when I ask him what plays he was in, he tosses off the references with effortless snobbery: 'Shakespeare, the Greeks and Brecht, mostly.' His senior tutor at Harvard, the late Pulitzer prize-winner William Alfred, said, somewhat equivocally, of Jones's Coriolanus that he was able to 'get over to us a sense of what a man would be like if he believed in his own nobility'. Jones left Harvard with a degree in English literature in 1969. Within days, he had landed a part on Broadway, and a year later he made his screen debut as Ryan O'Neal's Harvard room-mate in Love Story. The casting director wasn't sure at first that Jones was all that convincing, though, as it turns out, the role was probably based on him in the first place. Five years ago, there was a fuss over this very matter when Al Gore was chatting to a journalist about the novel on which the film was based. The O'Neal character, Gore is reputed to have said, was partially based on him. This, the author Erich Segal confirmed, was true - it was based on a combination of Al Gore and his room-mate, Tommy Lee Jones. Segal had been a teaching fellow at Harvard, and the two undergraduates would see him from time to time in the dining hall. But no sooner had Gore made this casual mention then it was taken up by the New York Times and others as a scandalous bit of self-promotion. Jones comes down hard when I ask him if he thinks it strange that the episode was deemed so important. 'Very strange,' he says. 'Erich's a strange man. He teaches classical Greek and Roman drama for a living, and writes these inane books for fun. And one of them did awfully well, and he enjoys talking loosely... But the idea of Al being a model for any of those characters is nonsense.' 'He said it was partly Al Gore and partly you.' 'I don't know what he said.' 'So you didn't recognise yourself in it?' 'No.' Jones's part in Love Story led to the modest glory of a regular daytime soap. For four years, he played Dr Mark Toland in One Life To Live. When he wanted to leave, the scriptwriters refused to allow his character to die tragically or move to another city. Instead, they turned him into a murdering psychopath, so viewers would not miss him. That was when Jones went to Hollywood, where he lived, at one time, in the house where Marilyn Monroe committed suicide. He wasn't spooked by it at all. ('It was a charming house,' he says. 'It had a nice little swimming pool and a couple of lovely orange trees.') Jones only really made it big in Hollywood much later, when Stone cast him in JFK in 1991, and he made it even bigger after The Fugitive. But he started out, like many luminaries, with Roger Corman. I had always wanted to do a Roger Corman road movie with a fast truck and a big pistol and a pretty girl running from the law... and I was lucky enough to get that job.' That was Jackson County Jail, in 1976. But although Jones had arrived in California at the height of its Seventies heyday, he wanted no part of the glamour. 'I've never really known what glamour is,' he says disdainfully, 'and if I had I would probably have had some kind of Ivy League distaste for it. There were a lot of drugs going around at that time,' he says, 'and you could see those drugs make the sound man deaf and the cameraman blind, the director would forget how to think and the prop man couldn't remember where he put anything.' 'Sounds like a Roger Corman movie,' I suggest. Jones is not amused. It's hard to get the measure of Jones's message. Sometimes he will address the most apparently trivial of subjects as if they were crimes waiting to be exposed. Is this Puritanism? Is it aloofness? Or merely impatience? Here he is, for example, on the familiar issue of driving in Los Angeles: 'I have never,' he declaims in the manner of Agent Kay, his character in Men In Black, 'seen so many people, packed together so tightly, all of them with at least one automobile, and dependent on it for any kind of transportation. Pedestrians were looked upon with great suspicion, and they're still not accommodated, and still not trusted. And that gets to be more and more wrong, with each passing day.' The severity of his speech! The archaic emphasis, the Southern twang of a preacher praying for mercy on your soul! What are we to make of this? Jones's eccentricities are as unpredictable as his temper. Here is a man who has been known to procure a Christmas turkey by waking up on his 3,000-acre cattle ranch and shooting one from the bedroom window. A Hollywood star who dressed up one Halloween as the 'Emperor of Ice-Cream' because he wanted to go trick-or-treating with his children as a Wallace Stevens poem. Jones married for the third time last year. His wife, Dawn Laurel, is a camera assistant. Before that, he was married for 14 years to Kimberlea Cloughley, with whom he had two children, Austin, 19, and Victoria, 10. When they met, Kimberlea's mother taught at Harvard, an institution, Jones tells me, he still 'reveres' and supports financially. Jones's first wife was Kate Lardner, whose father was a scriptwriter, and whose grandfather wrote short stories. Comparing the background of his first two wives with his own, I wonder if he might have been in search of a mentor. 'I did have a mentor,' he says, 'an English teacher named Victor Francis White, who introduced me to Shakespeare, and started me on a life of literature.' Jones goes on to describe, in detail, how his school teacher would make him write down in a spiral-bound notebook every word in Shakespeare that he didn't understand. I ask if he ever thought of rebelling against such discipline. 'T'were pity on my soul,' he soliloquises. 'Never. I would never, ever, give a thought to anything so stupid and rude as rebelling.' Jones has written a film of his own, The Good Old Boys, which he also directed and in which he stars. It aired on TV in 1995. We talk about westerns, of which The Good Old Boys is one, and Jones tells what he does and doesn't like about the work of 'Mr. Ford' and 'Mr Hawks'. 'Sometimes,' he muses on the subject of the latter, 'his plotting is a little bit thin and, you know, I get bored... with some of that macho camaraderie bullshit.' I raise an eyebrow, since that is not the sort of thing I had imagined Jones would object to, and he chooses to interpret my look as one of misunderstanding. 'Those,' he says with perfect deadpan aim, 'are technical terms we use in the motion picture business. I'd be happy to explain them to you later.' 'Thanks,' I smile, 'I'll write them down in my spiral-bound notebook.' Then, in the last few minutes and for the first time, his face stretches backwards into a dozen creases and Tommy Lee Jones laughs out loud. Breakthrough role: (1987) Best known for his noble characters in films such as Seven and The Shawshank Redemption, Freeman first made his screen name playing a brutal pimp in Street Smart, a clever New York thriller, starring Christopher Reeve. After seeing it, Pauline Kael wondered if he was 'the greatest actor in America'. The role earnt Freeman his first Oscar nomination. Breakthrough role: (1991) Hopkins moved to Los Angeles in the Seventies on the back of a flourishing stage career, but a combination of alcoholism and bad choices thwarted his progress. Gene Hackman and Michelle Pfeiffer were set to play the lead roles in Lambs, but when they pulled out, Hopkins and Jodie Foster stepped in. Hopkins is currently filming his third Hannibal Lecter film. Breakthrough role: (1987) Sarandon had earlier co-starred in Louis Malle's arthouse hit Atlantic City, but this was her first major role in a Hollywood success. She was one of three women, with Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer, charmed by a devilish Jack Nicholson. Sarandon plays a shy teacher who experiences a noisy sexual awakening. A far cry from the earthy roles that followed in Bull Durham and Thelma and Louise. Breakthrough role: (1997) Dench had long been established on British stage and screen when, in 1995, she played 007's boss, M, in GoldenEye. Two years later, a low-budget BBC film about Queen Victoria became her Hollywood calling card. Since then, she has played a string of character parts - Shakespeare in Love, Chocolat, and The Shipping News. Last year she starred as Iris Murdoch in Iris. Men In Black II is released on 1 August The above piece says that Tommy Lee Jones was the only mainstream Hollywood actor ever to have played Howard Hughes on screen. However, the noted recluse was also portrayed by Jason Robards, in the 1980 film Melvin and Howard.
1601	1602	Number 1: No Country for Old Men 	 After a decade in the doldrums, the Coen brothers returned to peak form with . Here was an instant classic, a bag-of-loot thriller adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy that rode hell-for-leather across a Tex-Mex landscape of fleapit motels and trailer parks. Josh Brolin turns in a superbly resilient, unshowy performance as the everyday Joe who makes a bad decision and winds up fleeing for his life. Hot on his trail is the demonic Anton Chigurh (Oscar-winning ), a serene psychopath who carries a cattle gun and selects his victims on the flip of a coin. Dawdling some distance behind, 's good-hearted sheriff can only shake his head at what the world has come to. So is our movie of the year. Could it also be the brothers' finest film to date? If it lacks Fargo's rum humanity and The Big Lebowski's freewheeling abandon, it compensates with sheer no-frills momentum. There is scarcely an ounce of fat on its bones and none of the wacky postmodern japery the Coens sometimes use to put a distance between a story and its audience. Here there is no escape. We are in it for the long haul, running alongside its imperilled hero and skirting on the rim of absolute evil. No Country for Old Men went on to win best picture at the (where it was surely the most deserving recipient since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1976). For once, it seems, the Guardian and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were in perfect agreement.
1605	1606	From teen TV to Blue Valentine: the winningly gloomy movie career of Michelle Williams 	"n its 11-year lifespan, America's teen network The WB was a highly visible training ground for a vast army of young actors. But the unblemished skin and wounded stares that can make a young star irresistible to adolescent audiences don't always guarantee a long and fulfilling career. The ensembles of such WB staples as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, Felicity, 7th Heaven, Gilmore Girls and Charmed experienced variable fortunes in their quests to be accepted as non-angsty adults. Some actors – Jessica Biel, Keri Russell and David Boreanaz among them – made smooth and successful transitions. Others less so. But no WB graduate has put as much distance between themselves and their small-screen origins as Michelle Williams. Sorry, make that creatively daring, critically acclaimed, Oscar-nominated Michelle Williams. Or, as her co-star in the new rise-and-fall-of-a-relationship movie Blue Valentine puts it, ""She's a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Clint Eastwood."" Eighteen-year-old Montana native Williams made a big splash in the formative days of super-articulate teen soap Dawson's Creek. Her character Jen Lindley was a jaded-but-virginal New York transplant hellbent on shaking up her new small-town home with her short skirts, her atheism and her tendency to say things like, ""I was sexualised at an early age."" The show's writers gradually fell out of love with Jen Lindley, marginalising her to the extent that Williams didn't even feature in posters for latter seasons. ""It was kind of being like a mobster,"" Williams has said of her time on the Creek. ""You set up a shop selling pizza but in the back you're laundering money. You're doing one thing in plain sight and secretly plotting something else. I was plotting my beliefs and hopes for what I could be."" While she endured the prerequisite running, screaming and bleeding in Halloween H20, Williams gave the first indications that she was being under-utilised by the WB in 1999's Dick. The film, about two high-school girls who become dog-walkers and close confidantes of Richard Nixon failed to attract the intended audience of teenage Watergate obsessives but it revealed Williams to be an able comedian capable of convincingly serenading a photo of Nixon with a heart-rending performance of Olivia Newton-John's I Honestly Love You. Before Jen Lindley breathed her last in 2003, Williams would do a stint off-Broadway in Tracy Letts's play Killer Joe, pull off an acceptable English accent in Me Without You, and fight her feelings for Chloë Sevigny in HBO's If These Walls Could Talk 2. But it wasn't until she played Alma, unsuspecting wife of Heath Ledger's tormented Ennis in Brokeback Mountain that Williams showed she could crush audiences' hearts without a single word. ""I relate to it,"" she said of the part. ""I've had that feeling of sort of choking yourself."" Williams received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work in Brokeback Mountain. She also became part of a high-profile couple with Ledger, and a reluctant tabloid fixture. But none of that got in the way of her single-minded pursuit of amassing as gloomy a filmography as she could manage. She was a grieving, adulterous, grief-stricken, vengeful, hallucinating terror victim in the London-based Incendiary. She played a baffled, miscast actress marooned in Philip Seymour Hoffman's never-ending play in Charlie Kaufman's never-ending . She slumped wordlessly through the dusty back alleys of Oregon in search of her lost dog in Wendy And Lucy. And last year, she haunted Leonardo DiCaprio's fevered subconscious in Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. ""I'd love to do something a bit more light hearted but not inane,"" Williams has confessed. The largely improvised doesn't quite fit that description. A non-linear chronicle of a relationship as it withers from blissful to toxic, the film, which has to date garnered Williams both Independent Spirit and Golden Globe Best Actress nominations, gives her the opportunity to do more than mope. A lot more, in fact. At one point, Gosling and Williams's characters Dean and Cindy get into a screaming fight that boils over into sex scenes angry and raw enough to earn the movie the dreaded NC-17 rating, a stigma removed only after strenuous canvassing and histrionics on the part of Harvey Weinstein. During the course of the couple's rancourous voyage, Williams also tap dances and gains 15 non-prosthetic pounds. A presumably less combustible pairing with Seth Rogen in the comedy Take This Waltz and an attempt to don the fragile mantle of Marilyn Monroe in My Week With Marilyn will follow. It's only seven years since the demise of Dawson's Creek but has come so far she makes it seem like a lifetime."
1606	1607	Eva Mendes: 'I don't care about looking beautiful' 	"""If you see ,"" says Eva Mendes, ""tell him Mendes really wants him. And I do a good cockney."" So I did. Or, rather, I emailed his agent. Mendes had already done the heavy lifting. ""I sent him a note maybe like eight years ago,"" she says, a little giddy, ""and I'm sure he had no idea who I was. And then I ran into him and he was lovely. So I just hope these last eight years I've maybe done something that he's liked or could see potential in, so we could possibly work together."" His films are magical, she says; they move her to tears. ""I come from a very Cuban family and for some reason his family dynamics, although not similar, are so familiar to me."" Leigh has been known to read the Guardian, I say. She sounds ecstatic. ""Maybe you can work it into your article somehow!"" To meet Mendes, it turns out, is to root for her, to be smoothly recruited on to her team. Together, maybe, just maybe, you can make this thing happen. A few days later, the agent writes back. Leigh is in pre-production on  and completely unavailable to deal with this. For Mendes, it will not be a shock. Nor for me. For there is a reason that she is unlikely to be first choice to play Jim Broadbent's long-lost daughter, or Timothy Spall's fag-ash pal, always up for sinking a pint somewhere off the North Circular. And she knows it. ""Somehow …"" she says, hesitantly, ""well, I've been told, anyway ... Some people have said that my image is a bit glamorous."" She may be on to something there. Mendes – , – a bit glamorous. Up close she is so striking you feel as if you are rubbernecking: skin silky, face radiant and lynx-like, lethal cheekbones, rollercoaster curves. She has fronted ads for Cartier, Revlon, Morgan, Cocio, , and Calvin Klein's Seductive Comfort lingerie. She has been a spokeswoman for , and . In 2009 she Magnum Ice Cream's Global Pleasure Ambassador (one for the passport, that) with a remit that included liaising with the firm's professor of pleasure and hosting a pleasure summit in Istanbul. It was here that she divulged that chocolate, hard work and three massages a week do it for her. (The professor's that men are better-skilled at extracting enjoyment from life, as they have an average PQ – that's ""pleasure quotient"" - score of 120 as opposed to 116 for women. Suck on that, .) Mendes is, then, no stranger to the billboard. But lately the campaigns have changed – fewer of them, with a different emphasis (basically: easy on the cleavage). The only one she has done this year is for . The reason is Leigh – or, at least, Leigh-alikes; Mendes also has Pedro Almodóvar and in her crosshairs. Some time in 2009, after shooting Frank Miller's vampy noir (on which she had ""a fine time""), she made a conscious choice. No more duff sequels. No more superfluous sultry. No more plain predictability. No more colons (she has done Mortal Kombat: Conquest, ; her debut was Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror). ""I just made a decision. I said: 'I am not working with the Mike Leighs of this world and I want to.' When it comes to being an actress I actually really love coming from a very raw place. Any opportunity I get to not wear makeup on set, I take. I really don't care about looking beautiful in a film unless I have to for the character. I don't check playback, I don't even know anything about lighting. I love anything that gets me closer to the role. So I needed to turn down those things that could possibly pigeonhole me."" In fact, Mendes is being a little tough on a CV that includes , and . Still, her strategy worked. Her first film post The Spirit was Werner Herzog's . Then came (in which Mendes successfully spoofed her own sex appeal) and the adultery drama . Over the past year she has been in one of the most acclaimed films of the decade (Leos Carax's ), a credible Mexican indie (Girl in Progress) and the new movie from the team behind , The Place Beyond the Pines. In it, she plays Romina, a hard-grafting waitress who becomes pregnant after a fling with Ryan Gosling's bleach-blond, bad-tatted stunt motorcyclist for a travelling circus. When he returns to town the following year, he realises he has a baby son and decides to stick around. This does not go well. It is a film preoccupied with paternal legacy – both for Gosling and for a local cop, played by Bradley Cooper, who has a son of the same age. The maternal influence is muted, but Mendes is scrubbily committed to, and convincing in, the part. She felt such kinship with the character that she told director Derek Cianfrance that an audition would not be appropriate: ""I just said: hey, I would love to drive you around and talk about Romina and show you where I grew up and draw the parallels there. I think that would probably best serve the character at this point."" Both she and Romina, she thinks, are products of their environment – the children of a single mother, raised in relative poverty. To be first-generation American is ""a great privilege but it also comes with a lot of responsibilities. You really don't have an excuse. Your parents most likely fought to get there and did it for you. You see Romina struggling to make the best life for her and her child. She's trying to make all the right decisions in a world that's a little, y'know, un-nuturing."" Cianfrance placed such faith in Mendes that he asked her to cast her on screen mother. The woman she went for (now ""Mommy #2"" on her mobile) was the one who most resembled the real-life version. In what way? ""Integrity. She had such a strong moral compass, but wasn't preachy. She just commanded respect in the real sense. And she didn't put on any airs but was definitely a woman who you just sat up a little straighter when she was around."" Pines is a movie with a pronounced moral backbone. It is oddly concerned with etiquette – Gosling's character (like his white knight in Drive) finds guns vulgar, considers condescension distasteful, suspects it would have been ""common courtesy"" to let him know he had a son. Such a code of conduct chimes with Mendes, about whom there is something peculiarly vintage – not just her (available exclusively at Macy's), or her . She seems like a star from a different era – a Sophia Loren, rather than a Cameron Diaz; already mature when she was 30 (she is now 39). She spends a lot of time with her mother – ""She's 70, a real fun age; every day there's a new pain and she laughs at it"" – and it's to spare her feelings, says Mendes, that she of her 2008 stint in rehab. Her relationship with Gosling is off-limits, also, as was an eight-year stretch with her previous boyfriend. Mendes – who nursed a – is a pinup perennial without tabloid baggage. She applauds the practice of pixelating the faces of celebrities' children and thinks the policy , as she gets unnerved when strangers know the name of her Belgian shepherd, Hugo. (It is possible they are clocking her and then joining the dots, rather than actually recognising the dog from a photo.) Most of all, she is scrupulously polite, friendly almost to a fault. When I first met her in Toronto, following Pines' premiere, it was alongside some other reporters, one of whom kicked things off with an appreciation of the outfit (demin hotpants, micro vest) she wears in her first scene with the returned Gosling. Mendes was, he felt, with hubba-hubba emphasis, ""letting him know what he'd left behind"". If she found that creepy, she didn't say so. Rather, she clutched the man's elbow and said: ""That's interesting you say that! God I you. I made a choice that was quite the opposite of that. I lost a lot of weight for it; like 15lb. I wanted it to feel like this baby had depleted her. Like he had sucked the life out of her; I saw her as very kind of unsexy and unflattering in that outfit. A little pathetic. I wanted to make her ."" She laughs. ""Please tell me I looked like shit."" There is silence. Approaching Mike Leigh was one thing. This may be a task too far. "
1612	1613	Oscars 2013: Lincoln stays red-hot favourite as awards fever rises 	"There's no mistaking it: the film industry awards season has moved into high gear this week. Wednesday and Thursday saw, in rapid succession, the announcement of nominations for the Baftas and the Oscars, and Sunday sees actual statuettes being dished out in the first major awards ceremony: the . With prizes having been handed out since well before Christmas by organisations large and small – from the Boston Society of Film Critics to the People's Choice awards – the buzz of background noise has been getting ever louder: but all eyes are focused on the big payoff, the Academy Award ceremony in the last week of February. The Oscars have retained their pre-eminent status through simple cause-and-effect: in recent years, nominated films have . Winners can expect to add at least 15% to their box-office grosses, and actors the Academy chooses to honour typically experience a 20% rise in their fees. Hence the imperative for master marketeers such as Harvey Weinstein: the are not simply an opportunity for finagling and ear-bending, but that award success is often the life blood for relatively serious-minded films that get little opportunity for major exposure at other times. The ""awards season movie"" is typically a classy-looking drama, bolstered by grandstanding acting performances, with easily digestible political relevance bolted on. It seems hardly a surprise, then, that Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is the red-hot favourite in every major awards setup, and is comfortably on top of the Oscar nomination pile with 12 nods. It follows the above template exactly: a detailed, beautifully designed rendering of civil war-era America; a dominating turn by as Abraham Lincoln as he angles to pass a constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery; and a clear parallel to the Obama re-election campaign and associated race issues in the US. , without doubt, is a Rolls-Royce of a movie, and one that has returned Spielberg to his position of a maker of films that are both hugely popular and cultural touchstones. In recent years Spielberg has struggled to live up to this reputation: you have go back as far as 1998's Saving Private Ryan to find a film that unarguably fulfilled the same role. And the fervour with which it has been greeted is in stark contrast to War Horse, Spielberg's awards contender last year. ""War Horse felt like it was made 50 years ago,"" says Wendy Mitchell, editor of film industry trade magazine Screen International. ""Lincoln, on the other hand, is so well crafted, and made so relevant to the election, that it has touched a nerve now. It's the big, weighty film Spielberg has been trying to make for years, the likes of Amistad, or Munich."" Charles Gant, film editor of Heat magazine, agrees Lincoln has energised the voters. ""It's a film that is certainly resonating in America, and one that no one feels bad about supporting. It looks like Spielberg's best chance to win the two top prizes, best picture and director, which he last did with in 1994."" Gant points out one of those cultural vagaries that can affect different awards: Spielberg failed to get a best director nomination from the Baftas. Perhaps the most telling example of the ups and downs of the awards season is provided by Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, another film that would appear to conform almost exactly to the template. Indeed, having won the top Oscars in 2010 for another Middle East-war film The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty initially looked set for a rerun of that film's acclaim. But after winning admiring reviews and cleaning up at the early voting awards such as the National Board of Review and Washington DC Area Film Critics Association, the film since became a political football, to the extent that Guardian columnist Naomi Wolf . And while Bigelow and her screenwriter Mark Boal have been , the toxic nature of the debate around the movie appears to have taken its toll, with a disappointing result from the Oscar nomination list. Gant explains: ""It's a tough hill for them to get over. When Academy members vote they want to feel good about it. That was the persuasive narrative when they opted for Bigelow over James Cameron – they want to be on the right side of history when they tick the box. I don't know if that's the case this time."" Before the Oscar nominations were announced, all the talk was that 2013 was seeing the return of the big Hollywood studios to awards favour, after several years of losing out to the independent sector. Certainly the prime position of Lincoln, produced by Dreamworks and 20th Century Fox, as well as the significant presence of Warner Bros' Argo, Fox's Life of Pi and Universal/Working Title's Les Misérables would bear that out. But the better than expected Oscar profile of Silver Linings Playbook, as well as nods for Django Unchained and The Master, means that maintains an interest in the Oscar race that seemed unlikely a few weeks ago. ""It's just the luck of the draw,"" says Gant. ""Studios have always been keen to make dramas as well as their tentpole movies, but sometimes they just don't succeed. The studios are normally in the running; but they've been outsmarted in the recent past."" Given that the awards season movie tends to harness what you might call the middlebrow element in the quality spectrum, Mitchell is in agreement as to the cyclical nature of studio involvement. ""To be honest, it's bit of a crapshoot. It's simply what's around. This is the year of what's doing well at the box office; next year the Coens and George Clooney will have finished films so the whole thing could turn again."" For all that, this does appear to be the year that American cinema has found its voice in the awards season, after being pushed aside by Europe in the last two years. Gant adds: ""America didn't step up last year – neither Hugo nor The Descendants could mount much of a challenge to The Artist. But this year the US is asserting itself in a big way. This year it does feel like there's a resurgence."" The Golden Globe awards take place on 13 January, the on 10 February and the Academy Awards on 24 February."
1623	1624	Can a Song Save Your Life? Toronto 2013 – first look review 	"r to put it another way: could a song end your life? Could just one number, performed weedily by at the beginning of this romcom, cause your body to self-combust at the prospect of enduring 90-odd minutes of a movie obsessed with authenticity but as phoney as a Miley Cyrus dance routine? Thankfully, the answer to the question is no. But it could certainly get close. This is the story of how a washed-up record exec finds his mojo by stumbling drunkenly on a rare talent whose songs speak of love and heartache. You might think you've heard such songs before, but you haven't. These songs are better. They're called things like Lost Star and have lines like ""We take a chance from time to time and put our needs out on the line"". This music changes lives. is Dan the record exec and Knightley the singer Greta (think Laura Marling, but even more home counties). She's come to New York on the arm of her boyfriend Dave Koch, also a singer, who's made it big. Greta is the real talent in the house but Dave, played by real life pop star Adam Levine, lets the fame go to his head and starts shagging around. Greta learns of his infidelity through perceptive interpretation of song lyrics and is forced to flee into the city with nothing but her dinky bicycle and her music. Oh and the friendship of James Corden. Yes, she really has fallen that low. Corden plays a Brit busker who not only appears to have avoided the need for a visa but can afford to rent a room in Manhattan despite consistently playing to audiences of none. He, like Dan, believes in the power of Greta and together they hatch a plan to get the girl a record deal by recording an album outdoors on the streets of New York. It's like punk all over again. Or like punk never happened. One of the two. Writer-director John Carney knows the record biz stuff, having been a member of Irish band the Frames. When Dan explains his studio-free recording project - ""All we need is a laptop, Pro Tools and a couple of dynamic mics"" - it sounds convincing enough. The musical references are right on too; everyone's a big Randy Newman fan and loves to get their Stevie Wonder on. It's only when you get to the music that's actually performed in the film that the trouble starts. All of the ""artists"" – be it the stars or the buskers - make the same kind of cod-poetic pop that asserts its personal authenticity but is entirely interchangeable. Ultimately the same goes for the characters. Committed artists to a man or woman, there's no real sense as to why that might be so. They're not anxious or angry, insecure or arrogant. They're just chirpy, breezy kids with a song in their heart. And for performers who care only about the art, they seem to know an awful lot about the music business too. The film's sole saving grace is, of course, Ruffalo. His very name suggests the shabbiness of his bummed out Dan, the only spot of grit in the movie. But he's also the only character to convey any semblance of actual passion, not just wide-eyed, bouncy heeled delight. He has an ugly leer and wears his self-loathing as a badge. He's worth clinging on for.  This review was written when the film was still called Can A Song Save Your Life? It has since been re-titled "
1636	1637	Colin Firth on The Railway Man: 'a whole chapter of history not taught' 	"The cast and crew of have urged for wider understanding of the plight of prisoners-of-war working on the Burma railway during the second world war. , who stars in the film as Eric Lomax, a real-life railway enthusiast from Scotland who struggled to cope both with his brutal treatment when incarcerated, and with the emotional scars such suffering left him later in life, explained how his knowledge of the period was informed not by history classes or cinema but though reading and conversations with a family friend. ""This whole chapter of history didn't feature certainly in my classes, nor in film lore in the way the European wars did. It's not as much a part of the conversation."" He was joined at a press conference for the film, which premiered at the , by Patti Lomax, the widow of Eric, who died last year. Patti, who is played in the film by Nicole Kidman, was keen to flag up the film's relevance for today's troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Unless they get real help immediately after they come back, and ongoing, for themselves and their families, then the trauma they have received colours their whole lives."" Frank Cottrell Boyce, who adapted Lomax's memoir for the big screen, said he felt testimony from this period had been ignored because Britain had won the war. ""We didn't want to hear stories about defeat and, in fact, surrender. That wasn't the right time for them. And then collectively those men had been so traumatised that they didn't speak themselves. They never had a voice."" He also echoed Patti's reminder of the story's topicality. The film includes protracted scenes in which the young Lomax - played by Jeremy Irvine - is brutally beaten, kept in a bamboo cage, then strapped to a table in a windowless shed, where a rag put across his face and a hose of water forced into this mouth. ""These are very live issues,"" said Cottrell Boyce. ""This isn't just about a forgotten moment in history. The way that Eric was tortured was water-boarding. When we first started working on this film that seemed like a kind if antique remote thing and now it's part of how we do business in the West."" Lomax himself died last year before he saw any footage, but one of his and Patti's sons was present on set every day, with Patti a regular visitor. One scene, Cottrall Boyce recalled, was shot at the end of the street where the Lomaxs lived in Berwick-upon-Tweed. He was too frail to venture outside, so Firth and Kidman visited him at home. ""He was jazzed by that visit, and he did want to come and visit the set. But we'd moved by then, up a hill, and it was quite windblown and awkward and all the electricians had to carry him up in his wheelchair like something from a Herzog movie."" Once there, Lomax - a trainspotter to the end - enquired about the gauge of tracking used for the dolly shot. The film shows how Lomax and his chief tormenter in Thailand met up years later, reconciled and became close friends. His widow hoped that it was this message of personal survival that audiences would take from the film. ""No matter how bleak life might be there's always a way forward if you're open to see it. Hanging on to old angers and slights and whatever life throws at you shouldn't stop you living. I think really that is a legacy that my husband has left. And it's as relevant to today as it was to yesterday."""
1637	1638	The Imitation Game review: Knightley and Cumberbatch impress, but historical spoilers lower the tension 	"he story of , the Enigma codebreaker who helped win the second world war and was chemically castrated by the state for his troubles, is a challenging one to make into a movie. Yes, there's some high-stakes stuff to work with: sex, spies, surveillance, the invention of computers and the fate of millions of people. But it's a tale whose key moments have already fallen victim to spoilers. Will Turing's massive deciphering machine work? It might. Will we beat the Germans? Possibly. It's also a story whose hero is both venerated and pitied, but about whom most people know little. Unlike, say, Stephen Hawking, whose biopic premiered at the Toronto film festival on Sunday, this is not a man whose work we got for Christmas, whose face and voice are immediately familiar. This allows more free rein, but the audience less certainty over how to gauge his merits. What Cumberbatch delivers is an impressively rounded character study of someone variously kind, prickly, aggressive, awkward and supremely confident. But it's almost too nuanced. Accuracy isn't all, but fumbling in the dark isn't always fun. The film is bookended by scenes of Turing's interrogation by a Manchester policeman (Rory Kinnear) who smells a rat after investigating a burglary in Turing's flat. The place is a tip, yet nothing appears to have been taken, and the victim is sniffily dismissive: ""What I could use now is not a bobby but a good cleaning lady."" Kinnear digs a little deeper and unearths … nothing. Turing has no war record. So what really went on at the radio factory where he said he worked? And so the story proper starts, with Turing's interview at Bletchley Park, where he fares badly with the bluff sergeant Charles Dance, but is rescued by mysterious Mark Strong. In an expository scene rich in Sorkin-ish dialogue and light on plausibility, we're told about the mission and introduced to the rest of the team, including Matthew Goode (cad), Allen Leech (Scot) and Matthew Beard as a little chap who always seems so ill-informed and off-the-pace you wonder if he's an intern. New recruits are required if they're to whip Hitler, so Turing courts candidates through a cryptic crossword: if they solve it they can attend an exam in London. When shows up and is mistaken for a secretary, you don't have to be a whiz to guess she'll not only ace the test but do so miles faster than her male counterparts. Graham Moore's script tracks the code-cracking, alongside Turing and Knightley's burgeoning closeness and the progress of the war (through familiar newsreel). At points, we flash forward to the police investigation (""He's a poof, not a spy!"" exclaims one copper, having a eureka moment) and back to Turing's schooldays friendship with a boy called Christopher. Much about – cast, subject matter, parquet flooring – appears to mimic the 2011 film of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, with which it also shares Working Title roots and a director making their English language debut (in that case, Tomas Alfredson, in this, Morten Tyldum). But it's not as chilly or convincing, doesn't burn with the same intellectual intensity as that film, nor of, say, The Social Network, whose template it apes. What works is – as with Hawking story The Theory of Everything – the relationship between the central couple. Knightley is miles better than she's been in a while; sitting on a shelf rather than centre stage seems to suit her. She has fun with her plummy vowels, even when saying lines like ""I'm a woman in a man's job"". Cumberbatch's Turing is most interesting when at his softest; endlessly bashing up against less brilliant colleagues or military bureaucracy is bruising all round. But it's the script which may prevent this hitting the Oscars jackpot. It's too formulaic, too efficient at simply whisking you through and making sure you've clocked the diversity message.: without square pegs – like those played by Cumberbatch and Knightley – the world would be by far the poorer. ""Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of that do the things no one can imagine,"" runs the movie's mouthful tagline. It leaves a strange taste. Turing's treatment was terrible. Perhaps his achievement, in the end, should not be tainted by association. Comments have been reopened to time with this film's Australian release"
1638	1639	Hunger Games stars tell Jennifer Lawrence to return Oscar for forgetting lines 	"Woody Harrelson told Hunger Games star to give her Oscar back each time she forgot her lines on the set of sequel Catching Fire, according to the pair's fellow cast-members. Since filming last year's blockbuster dystopian action movie the 23-year-old star has picked up the Academy Award for best actress for her work in the acclaimed David O Russell comedy drama Silver Linings Playbook and risen to the top of the Hollywood A-list. Speaking at a press conference in London ahead of tonight's world premiere in Leicester Square, co-star Josh Hutcherson revealed Lawrence had not picked up any additional airs and graces, though her new-found fame had made her the butt of most of the on-set jokes. ""She didn't bring her Oscar with her,"" said Hutcherson, who plays Peeta Mellark in Francis Lawrence's film. ""I'm curious to know who brings their Oscar on set. But every time she would forget a line, Woody would go: 'Oh, better give that Oscar back!' ""She was already a pretty big target, but after the Oscar she was an even bigger target. But no, she didn't change at all."" Jeffrey Wright, who plays new character Beetee, revealed his attempt to play a practical joke on Lawrence backfired in devastating fashion. ""When Jennifer won the Oscar I gave her a gift of a Liberty box, filled with 200 crickets. What I didn't calculate was that when you fill a box with 200 crickets, many of them spill out in your hotel room, and hop under your bed and behind your dresser. So I couldn't sleep for about a week with the sound of these crickets."" For her part, Lawrence praised her family for making huge financial sacrifices to help her career in the early days. ""I wouldn't be here without my parents, who took out a second mortgage to let me do this,"" she said. ""My brothers told them 'let me go' and I lived without parents for a couple of years. They are my rock. They are always there."" She added: ""I love this movie so much and I'm excited for everyone to see it."" Also starring Jena Malone, Liam Hemsworth, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Toby Jones and Willow Shields, continues the story of Katniss Everdeen in the wake of her victory in the original Hunger Games. With the cruel rulers of the future nation of Panem fighting the first stirrings of rebellion, Katniss and Peeta find themselves plunged back into a new and very different Hunger Games arena. The sequel is being tipped to be one of the year's highest-grossing movies. "
1651	1652	Eddie Redmayne: the loneliness of being a hot young actor 	" is rapidly shrinking into the slippery dark brown leather sofa upon which he sits, his head is disappearing under the neckline of his navy blue jumper, and his hands are raised ready to cover his ears. The cause of his discomfort? Me, sadly, as I read aloud some comments I've found on the various fansites dedicated to his very being. ""Eddie: Flawless, ethereal, could 'get it' wearing tweed any day of the week,"" I read out to him. ""Wearing ?"" he repeats in his very British accent, following it with a huge burst of laughter. ""Eddie is possibly the best human in the world,"" I continue, as he shrinks further. ""Oh GOD!"" ""Eddie is so charming, and I am legit attracted to him."" ""Legit?"" he guffaws. ""LEGIT?"" For those dedicated fans of Redmayne, 29, of which the most cursory search of the internet would indicate there are thousands, the end of this year is going to be a good one. It sees the release of , an autobiographical account of the week Colin Clark (Redmayne), a recently graduated film obsessive, spent babysitting Marilyn Monroe in 1956 as she filmed The Prince And The Showgirl. It also sees the start of a stint at the Donmar Warehouse in Richard II. Further to that will be Birdsong, the BBC adaptation of 's best-selling book. After years of critical acclaim, winning both an Olivier and a Tony award for his performance in John Logan's Red (a play about Mark Rothko) at the Donmar and on Broadway respectively, as well as supporting roles in films alongside Julianne Moore (Savage Grace), Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth: The Golden Age) and Natalie Portman (The Other Boleyn Girl), it feels like Redmayne's ""moment"" has finally come. ""I see that there's a timing aspect of it all,"" he says, slightly squirming again (for an actor, he seems to find talking about himself relatively mortifying), ""but any one of these things could collapse. I've found in the past that the critical reaction to a piece, if it's damned, will colour my memory of what the experience was. I had a wonderful time on Marilyn, a wonderful time on Birdsong and, hopefully, I'll have a wonderful time on this [he brandishes the yellow highlighter-heavy script for Richard II sitting on the table in front of him] so I'm trying not to think outside of that because it can pollute the experience."" My Week With Marilyn is undeniably Redmayne's highest-profile project to date. The cast reads like a Bafta fellowship guest list. Kenneth Branagh, Dame Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi, his friends Emma Watson and Dominic Cooper, and the piece de resistance, the lone American, , as Marilyn Monroe. With his gentle disposition – the impeccable manners seem second nature rather than an actorly affectation – you rather wonder how Redmayne will cope with the spotlight. ""The word 'buzz' worries me if I'm honest,"" he says, before pausing, and skilfully steering the conversation on to more familiar ground. ""Michelle and I were there in most scenes and, every day, another bastion of the British establishment would come in and play opposite us; it was wonderful."" I bring up that it must have been an exciting prospect for him to act alongside Williams, having confessed in a past interview to being such a fan of … ""Dawson's Creek!,"" he laughs. ""That's coming back to haunt me, I should never have fucking said that. But she is extraordinary. She makes the part look effortless."" Since graduating from Cambridge in 2003 (he got a 2:1 in art history), Redmayne has worked almost constantly, playing paedophiles and boys who sleep with their mothers via the odd costume drama across film, television and the theatre. ""What's really interesting about actors,"" he says, in that thoughtful, careful way that envelops all of his answers, ""is that we all have opinions on how people's careers look, but I think you never have any idea of your own, or what other people think of you."" Marilyn sees him playing his most ""normal"" character to date. ""I'm six years older than Colin,"" he agrees, ""but I'm an Old Etonian, too. Weirdly, I found it just as challenging as playing the character I did in [the aforementioned mother lover]. What's been lovely is the variety of it all, and America has been very helpful for that. So much of our industry here is period drama, and given my background, that is what you slot into. But in America, because you're English, they send you off to everything because they can't bracket you. They'll go, 'Can you play an adopted native American Indian? OK, go audition for it, why not?'"" Redmayne is not from a clan of actors; he comes from a family of bankers, a world which he attempted to understand with a stint of work experience while at school. ""It was the greatest feat of acting ever working there,"" he says, ""having to pretend I knew what a share was when I didn't have a clue."" He's clearly far more at home in the acting world, but maybe there's a hankering for the 9 to 5. ""I think all actors have a similar deal,"" he says. ""You want some people who understand. Although it looks great – and great – there are also shoddy moments when you feel really rotten, and when it's going well, you're not allowed to complain. Your actor friends will understand the nuances of a painful director, or the loneliness of being … OK, in a beautiful hotel room somewhere exotic. But you're by yourself for six months, and you're thinking, 'Oh God, I wish I could share it with someone.' I'm trying to buy a house and set some sense of roots because otherwise you're constantly chasing one job after another, and you look back and you've had all these very extraordinary experiences with extraordinary people, but there's not a line of continuity to it."" Perhaps one of his fans could fill the void the nomadic lifestyle creates? ""I have this horrific thing where I'm really bad with names and faces,"" he grimaces. ""I have an appalling memory. Someone will come up to me in the street and go, 'Eddie!', and I'll try and give myself time by going into overdrive, 'Hey, hi! Nice to see you!' and start a whole conversation because I can't distinguish between who I know and who I don't. My worst fear is somebody who I went to school with when I was eight coming up and me going, 'Sorry, who are you?' It's my worst nightmare."" So does he have groupies following him? ""No,"" he laughs. ""Benedict Cumberbatch is a mate of mine, and we did a charity show at the Old Vic together. There was this group of women outside the theatre who name themselves 'the Cumberbitches' and follow him round the world. I have nothing like that. I really wouldn't know what to do with the situation."" Maybe, but with his ""legit"" attractiveness, appeal in tweed, and career explosion imminent, it's surely only a matter of time before those Cumberbitches (Redmayniacs?) come Eddie's way too."

They're as great as it gets. I would love to work with [Kevin Spacey]. If I had anything for him I would do it in a minute."" Allen also said he is a perfectionist who is never completely happy with his films. ""I am always disappointed.

Allen explained: ""Emma [Stone] is going to do this line and it will be great.

1662	1663	Jubilant yes voters greet SNP's Salmond and Sturgeon in Glasgow 	"Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon have celebrated 10 years as leader and deputy leader of the amid jubilant crowds in central Glasgow. The pair were almost overwhelmed in a scrum for selfies and handshakes on Thursday as Salmond praised the ""tremendous, enthusiastic, good-natured movement of people in towards a yes vote"". A gathering in Buchanan Street, one of the city's main shopping districts, of more than 100 Yes Scotland activists bearing multicoloured balloons and banners soon attracted supportive passersby. Three young women leaning out of the second-floor window of a nearby hairdressing salon yelled: ""Go on yersel', Nicola"", before starting up a chant of ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" that resounded from the crowd. When a couple of stray no supporters arrived with placards reading ""tax cuts for the rich"", the yes campaign swiftly deployed their tallest activists to stand in front of them with more sympathetic signage. ""We can rise above it!"" exclaimed one man – literally. On the day that Ed Miliband returned to Scotland to galvanise pro-union support in Labour's heartlands and deliver the message that voting no is the best route to a fairer country, Salmond warned that the ground was shifting under the Labour leader's feet. A YouGov poll this week revealed that support for independence among Labour voters had risen from 18% to 30% in the past month. ""The problem with Ed Miliband is his lack of credibility on these issues. This is someone who is in bed with David Cameron; he is in a joint alliance with the Tory party, and at Westminster they have pledged to continue Tory austerity policies,"" Salmond said. ""That's why we've seen a mass movement of people who normally vote Labour towards the yes campaign."" Saying that he was confident the yes campaign could win the referendum in two weeks, he added: ""At the grassroots, Labour people in Scotland are turning their back on the Westminster elite, and that includes Ed Miliband."" Salmond said the Labour leader was mistaken in pitching this as a battle between Labour and the SNP. ""What Ed Miliband doesn't seem to understand is that this is not about the SNP. This about the opportunity the people of Scotland have at each and every future election to get the government of our choice."" Asked specifically about Miliband's criticism of SNP policy on corporation tax, Salmond insisted that a 3p cut would generate 27,000 jobs in Scotland and increase economic growth. Asked whether he would raise the top rate of income tax, as Miliband has pledged to do, Salmond said it was the wrong time because the country was still experiencing austerity. At an event marking a decade as Salmond's deputy, it was inevitable that Sturgeon was asked whether she would consider party leadership. ""That's not in my mind at all at the moment,"" she said. ""I'm very much focused on getting people to vote yes."" Asked where she would like to be in 10 years, Sturgeon laughed that she had no idea. ""If you'd told me that on our 10th anniversary we'd be two weeks from a referendum, I'd have wanted to believe you but would I have done? I don't know. I'll let the future, in terms of my own personal career, take care of itself."""
1674	1675	Carney: massive shortfall in currency reserves for independent Scotland 	" was dragged further into the debate about the currency implications for an independent Scotland on Wednesday, telling MPs that in the event of a yes vote Scotland would need to amass billions of pounds of currency in reserves if it uses sterling without a formal agreement with Westminster. The governor insisted that he would not provide new information to the Treasury select committee on such a politically sensitive topic, but indicated that a Scottish central bank could need at least 25% and possibly more than 100% of GDP in reserves if sterling was used after independence. Reiterating , Carney said Scottish GDP was £106bn – although this figure is lower than estimates of £140bn when the oil industry is included. Under intense questioning by Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, and other MPs on the panel, Carney said that countries with a large financial system require larger reserves if they use another country's currency. He said Scotland's banks had assets around 10 times the country's GDP and the size of the banking sector would ultimately determine the scale of reserves. He repeatedly sidestepped attempts by MPs to produce a definite figure, pointing only to the Baltic states – aligned to the eurozone – which need 25% of reserves and to Hong Kong, which had reserves of more than 100% of GDP. Tyrie secured a pledge from the governor to provide by Thursday morning the detailed analysis conducted by the Bank of England of what a Scottish central bank might need, based on how other countries have handled such situations. He put it to Carney that amassing the necessary level of reserves would require higher taxes and spending cuts, running a budget surplus or even turning to the International Monetary Fund for support. The governor refused to get into discussions about fiscal policy. However, he appeared to agree with Tyrie's assessment that may have access to £15bn in reserves at the outset. Carney was giving evidence after that a currency union was ""incompatible with sovereignty"". The governor's view is a major setback for the claim by Alex Salmond that Scotland could share the pound and become an independent nation. He said that in the event of a yes vote the Bank of England would continue to back Scottish bank notes until a formal separation of the two nations – expected in March 2016. Without offering specifics, Carney said: ""We've been doing contingency planning. We have contingency plans. We would of course implement (them) if required to support financial stability."" Asked about capital flight from Scotland, Carney appeared to acknowledge the risk. He said: ""The Bank of England is the continuing authority for financial stability … the contingency plans we have developed … we would put in place and that is the assurance we would give."" In the immediate aftermath of the vote, he said: ""The institutions in Scotland have access to Bank of England facilities, deposits in Scotland are backed by the . There are reasons why we have contingency plans in place,"" he said. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme promises to back the equivalent of €100,000 (£85,000) held in bank accounts in the UK, as part of arrangements put in place across the EU after the 2008 banking crisis. Earlier on : ""We cannot speculate at this time on what the Scottish referendum might mean for consumers. This will depend on decisions to be taken by the Scottish government. However, EU directives place a clear requirement on countries in the EU to provide a deposit scheme. The current European limit is €100,000."" The FSCS added: ""The matter of Scottish independence is for the Scottish voters to decide. If the vote is in favour of , there is likely to be a transitional period. During any such period, we expect consumers will continue to be protected by the FSCS as at present, and compensation cover would continue unaffected."""
1694	1695	Gordon Brown: independent Scotland would not be more equal or progressive 	"Scotland would not be a more equal or progressive country if it votes for independence, has warned. The former prime minister said people should forget the notion that an independent would be ""some kind of northern light for a new form of social democracy"" because Alex Salmond's policies would not redistribute wealth or give Scots control of their economy. Brown also criticised the SNP leader's claim that he would hold on to the pound in the event of independence, saying it would make Scotland a ""semi-colonial"" outpost with no say over interest rates. Brown said: ""All you need to do is look at the policies of the SNP to be clear that there is no redistributive impulse. There is no suggestion income inequality would be less. They've got this great proposal for reducing business taxation, the biggest beneficiaries of which would be the privatised utilities, whose prices we want to freeze. Don't look to the SNP for some kind of social democratic easy way out for people who believe in progressive politics and don't think that's happening in the rest of the UK at the moment."" His comments appear to sound a warning to left-leaning Scots who may be tempted to vote for independence rather than risk getting a Tory government in London next year. Brown made the remarks at the Guardian offices in London as he set out the case for greater cooperation between all the four countries of the UK, Europe and the rest of the world. He argued that the rise of nationalist forces in Scotland were less about a quarrel with England than a failure to create a British identity and deal with the challenges of globalisation. ""Unless we have a clear idea of what interdependence means, not just within Britain, but Europe and the rest of the world, then nationalist movements, protectionism and xenophobia will be very powerful … We must have a view of how we can manage globalisation, which is what the biggest issue is facing the UK, about he we can expose the fact nation states alone cannot solve these problems, whether it's climate change or financial stability or growth,"" said the former Labour leader He added: ""Globalisation needs a human face. It should have been [Barack] Obama. Obama should have represented how the world should come together in the modern era. Unfortunately, it is not. There has got to be a sense that there is leadership for global co-operation in the world."" Asked whether Ed Miliband, was doing a good enough job to convince Scots that he would be prime minister next year, Brown said both the Labour leader and Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, were making a ""pretty strong argument"" for the UK to stay together. Pressed on whether he had a ""sneaking admiration"" for Salmond as a politician, Brown answered: ""Well he's won an election, which is more than I managed."""
1702	1703	Scottish independence would leave families worse off, says Gordon Brown 	" has claimed that low and middle-income families in Scotland would be more than £1bn worse off if the country votes for independence, and re-elects Alex Salmond's government. The former prime minister said a line-by-line comparison between the Scottish National party's tax and spending plans with Labour's offer to voters, which includes higher taxes for the wealthiest, would cost every household in £450. In a speech before Scottish opened its spring conference in Perth, Brown stepped up his party's attacks on the first minister's economic policies and heavy reliance on oil revenues, in a concerted effort to portray the SNP as the party of business and the better off. ""Everyone knows the SNP cannot afford all of their promises. But what has become clear is that when it comes to a choice, they prefer giving business tax cuts and money to the richest Scottish energy companies than cash to Scottish families,"" Brown said. He singled out Salmond's reluctance to promise a new 50p upper rate of income tax or introduce a ""mansions tax"" for larger homes; while Salmond's deputy, , said a 50p rate is the party's ""instinct"", she has refused to commit to that policy before the 2016 Scottish elections. He added that the SNP government in Edinburgh had rejected Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices until 2017; that would cost Scottish households £118m. Cutting corporation tax to 3% below the UK rate would lose £300m from onshore companies or £700m if North Sea oil companies were included. And after independence, Scotland faced losing £420m in UK pensions payments, he said. Risking immediate attack from his opponents for presiding over the 2008 financial crash, Brown claimed the independence referendum was not just a choice between yes and no, ""it is about Labour's fairness versus the SNP's unfairness"", he said. ""Under the SNP, in an independent Scotland, we can show that inequality will rise, and injustice to poor areas will widen,"" he added. In his address Brown said the biggest winners from the SNP's plans for a 3% corporation tax cut and its refusal to back Labour's fuel prices freeze were the energy companies built out of the UK's privatised utilities. ""We've talked about fat cats. Now we've got a new phenomenon - fat Nats [nationalists]. That's what we're going to see. The biggest beneficiaries of an SNP government are the privatised utilities in Scotland,"" he said. Referring to the nationalists who are very active on social media, known by their opponents as cybernats, he added: ""Is this what independence was all about? Is this what the freedom fight has all been for? That the biggest bonanza of an independent Scotland would go to the privatised utilities? ""The Scot Nats [sic] giving tax cuts to the fat cats cheered on, of course, by the cybernats."" The SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson said Brown's claims were ""desperate stuff"", and reminiscent of Scottish Labour's discredited claims that voters would be £500 worse off if the SNP were elected in 2007. ""Over the past five years, Scotland's finances have been stronger than the UK's to the tune of £8.3bn or nearly £1,600 per person in Scotland - and the figures also show that Scotland has now generated more tax per head than the UK as a whole for every single one of the last 33 years - this is the true cost of the Westminster system to Scotland. ""This is a tried and failed tactic form Labour; in 2007 they claimed Scots would be £500 per person worse off if the SNP was elected - their pie in the sky sums were rubbish then and they are rubbish now."" Brown's attack, which will be followed on Friday by a concerted attack on Salmond and SNP from the UK Labour party leader, , suggests Scottish Labour is unnerved by the ground being gained by the independence movement and SNP in urban areas of Scotland. Insisting that far gloomier oil revenues predictions from the Office for Budget Responsibilty made it inevitable that an independent Scotland would be forced to cut spending or raise taxes sharply, he said: ""There is only one inevitability with SNP plans. If we don't get the benefit from Labour's tax changes and lose the transfers from the UK inequality will rise in Scotland and under their policies it will end up being worse than in the rest of the United Kingdom."""
1703	1704	Kermit the Frog adds croak to 'no' campaign over Scottish independence 	"After David Bowie's plea to to ""stay with us"", another international superstar has entered the independence debate with a call for a ""no"" vote. However, the Better Together campaign may not be so pleased with this particular celebrity endorsement, coming as it does from a self-declared Muppet – Kermit the Frog. Interviewed for the Big Issue magazine, the green star of the Muppet Most Wanted movie insisted that he wants the UK to stay united, though he appeared to hint at a split within the Muppet camp, with Miss Piggy interested in snapping up the title of Queen of Scotland. He also risked offending Scottish voters ahead of the 18 September referendum by using the word ""England"" when he was apparently referring to the whole of Britain. Asked if he agreed with Bowie that Britain should stay together, Kermit told the magazine: ""Absolutely."" But he added: ""I understand that Miss Piggy is willing to serve as Queen of Scotland if there is a split. So you may want to guard your castles."" The shock intervention in the independence battle immediately led to questions being asked at Westminster. At a daily media briefing in the House of Commons, David Cameron's official spokesman was asked whether the prime minister had ""had a hand in"" Kermit's comments. To groans of amusement from the assembled reporters, the spokesman responded in an affronted tone: ""Are you suggesting someone has been pulling strings?"" Kermit told the Big Issue that he ""loves the UK"" because British viewers understood the Muppets' humour. ""The British people really 'got' our humour,"" he said. ""Heck, you folks even get Fozzie's jokes, but it was the great impresario Lord Lew Grade who gave us our first big break ... and we're forever grateful to him and to everyone here in England."""
1704	1705	Scottish independence could mean 'years of disruption for finance industry' 	"Scotland's banks and finance industry would face a long and costly period of disruption and uncertainty if there was a yes vote for independence, a major industry organisation has warned. , the trade body for 110 banks, insurers, finance firms and pension companies, said there were too many unknowns over which currency and central bank Scotland would use, the impact of its EU membership talksand the effects of two diverging markets replacing the UK's current single market. It said the scale and complexity of the task facing after a yes vote cast real doubts on whether the Scottish government's target of declaring independence in March 2016 was achievable. ""Having consulted widely and in particular with those not advancing a case on either side of the independence debate, it looks likely that negotiations will take several years and certainly a lot longer than the 18 months suggested by the Scottish government,"" it stated. ""As has been obvious ever since the referendum process was launched, nobody can know, this side of the referendum, what the consequences of a yes vote will be,"" it said. In a detailed briefing for its members, who employ 100,000 people, SFE warned they needed to plan for Scotland creating a new currency or unilateral use of the pound after the chancellor, George Osborne, had vetoed the Scottish government's call for a sterling zone. Describing that currency union as ""a major undertaking"", SFE said: ""The Scottish government's proposals for a currency union are experimental and unprecedented in the EU."" SFE said it believed using sterling without a formal currency union – the option believed to be the most likely ""plan b"" if the UK does veto a sterling pact after a yes – could be far more difficult for Scotland than many people appreciated. It said the EU could block Scottish membership under those circumstances, because it would leave Scotland without its own central bank – a breach of EU rules. It would mean the EU had two currency unions, for the euro and for sterling, and also mean every other EU state allowing Scotland to avoid joining the euro, with some countries requiring their own referendums on the treaty changes needed to suit Scotland's special case. It said: ""There is no discernible benefit and a possible significant additional cost to our industry and its customers in this happening, compared with the current situation."" Owen Kelly, SFE's chief executive, said the organisation was neutral about whether Scotland should be independent, but added that many of the most important questions could not answered until after a yes vote. The SFE document said that was in part because neither the Scottish nor UK governments could predict what post-referendum negotiations would result in, nor what other EU member states would say, but also because both governments were taking partisan positions on independence. ""What we know for sure is that there are some major risks and uncertainties directly affecting the financial services industry in Scotland, and some key issues [that] ideally, would be addressed before the referendum to remove the uncertainties and enable businesses to plan how to mitigate the risks,"" Kelly said. ""But the political process does not allow this, as has been clear from its inception."" SFE took a more pragmatic view on EU membership than some no campaigners, by arguing there would likely be a transition period for Scotland within the EU rather than being forced out before reapplying or being forced to suddenly accept new terms. Despite the disclosure from Standard Life that it was making contingency plans to move large areas of its UK business into England after independence, and warnings that Lloyds and RBS would relocate to London, SFE made no predictions about job-losses or company relocations. It said those issues were a matter for individual companies. Pointing out that independence would present the industry with opportunities, on issuing government bonds and currency, and on legal services, it said the hypothetical long-term benefits of a smaller, more dynamic economy and a more attractive tax system were hard to weigh up. John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said other senior figures in Scottish finance, including former SFE executive director James Scott and Sir George Mathewson, former chairman of RBS, believed independence offered the industry ""significant opportunities."" He dismissed the SFE paper as a briefing note by SFE officials, not the industry's considered view. A steady rise in the yes vote in recent opinion polls also established that voters did not buy ""the bluff and bluster"" of those opposed to independence. ""The reality is that Scotland is a wealthy country, with a successful financial services industry which is more than capable of thriving under any constitutional position,"" Swinney said."
1708	1709	Stagecoach warns Scottish independence could hurt business 	", the sprawling transport group led by one of the Scottish National party's highest profile backers, has warned investors that September's independence referendum could hit the business. Anti-independence campaigners seized on the warning given by the bus and train operator in its annual results, as the company's co-founder and chairman, Sir Brian Souter, is a major donor of the SNP and supporter of independence. Souter, who ran the Perth-based group as chief executive until May 2013, recently gave £100,000 to fringe group Christians for Independence and promised to match up to £1m-worth of donations to the SNP's referendum campaign. However, in the ""principal risks and uncertainties"" section of the report, the company states: ""There is a risk that changes to the regulatory environment or changes to the availability of public funding could affect the Group's prospects. Such changes may arise as a result of the outcomes of the September 2014 referendum on and/or the 2015 UK general election."" Ian Murray, Labour's shadow business minister in the Commons and a spokesman for the Better Together campaign, said the passage had driven ""a coach and horses"" through the case for independence. ""Being part of the UK single market works well for firms like Stagecoach,"" Murray said. ""Scottish employers have access to a market of more than 63 million people across the UK, rather than just 5 million people in . Where is the sense in putting up barriers between Scottish firms and their customers based elsewhere in the UK?"" A Stagecoach spokesman said: ""Consistent with other companies, we ensure our investors are aware of relevant matters affecting our business, both risks and opportunities. ""It is not a comment on the merits of Scottish independence, which we have consistently stated is a matter for the people of Scotland to decide. Stagecoach Group remains neutral on the issue, as it has always been."" Stagecoach is the latest in a string of companies to spell out potential problems if Scotland votes to become a separate country. They include Shell, BP, Scottish engineering group Weir and retailer Kingfisher, which has said it is putting Scottish investment on hold until the outcome of the referendum is known. Standard Life has set up offices in England to prepare for a split and Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday reiterated that independence could affect the bank's credit rating, tax situation and regulation. Meanwhile, Stagecoach announced a slight increase in profits to £180.3m after tax, and pointed to the return of rail franchising as a reason for optimism. Stagecoach's finance director, Ross Paterson, said: ""In rail we're now seeing momentum in the franchise process. We were disappointed not to win Thameslink but encouraged it has been awarded. We are expecting a good opportunity on East Coast."" Stagecoach owns 49% of the rival north-south long-distance and West Coast mainline operator Virgin Trains, and is one of the three shortlisted firms to run East Coast. The company announced that Virgin Rail had paid Stagecoach a dividend of £4.2m for 2013-14, and a fractionally larger sum to Richard Branson, the majority shareholder. Paterson said: ""It was a relatively low shareholder return that reflects the position the franchise was in."" He added: ""The existing contract gave us a 1% management fee for running the business … It didn't give us what we wanted but it also wasn't good for customers or taxpayers as it didn't create an incentive to invest and grow the business."" Paterson said a private operator could drive up passenger numbers on East Coast. ""It's about trying to be creative, how are you able to make the product even more appealing to customers?"" However, the latest national rail passenger survey released on Wednesday showed East Coast has outperformed its long distance rivals in satisfaction scores. The Passenger Focus research conducted this spring gave the state-run operator a 91% score – just ahead of Virgin and First Great Western. Elsewhere, Stagecoach's bus business continued to drive earnings. In the US, profits were up 80% year on year, largely due to the growth of Megabus."
1713	1714	Lloyds investors file for losses they claim were incurred in HBOS rescue 	"A group of investors yesterday filed a claim for compensation from for losses they claim they incurred during the rescue of HBOS in 2008. The Lloyds Action Now activist group has spent years assembling the case, which argues that the true health of was deliberately concealed from investors when Lloyds was taking over the troubled bank. The enlarged bank later had to be bailed out with £20bn of taxpayer money. No specific amount of compensation has been outlined in the claim, but it is argued that £12bn of shareholder value was lost when HBOS was taken over. These are not the only court proceedings to be filed against one of the banks rescued by taxpayers during the crisis. shareholders are claiming more than £4bn because, they argue, they were misled by the bank during a cash call it launched before being bailed out by the taxpayer. Taxpayers own 81% of RBS and 24% of Lloyds. There is speculation that the government intends to dispose of the rest of its stake in Lloyds before the general election next year. On the compensation claim, a spokesman for Lloyds said: ""The group's position remains that we do not consider there to be any legal basis to these claims and we will robustly contest this legal action."" The Lloyds Action Now shareholders said they had named a number of former Lloyds directors in the claim, including the former chairman Sir Victor Blank, the former chief executive Eric Daniels and three other former directors. The shareholders argue that information about the emergency funding HBOS was receiving, such as the £25bn received through the Bank of England's emergency liquidity assistance facility, was not disclosed at the time of the Lloyds deal. Their case, which Lloyds has until December to formally respond to, also alleges that there was a loan from the US Federal Reserve that was not disclosed. There are 7,500 shareholders signed up to the lawsuit. An application has been made for a group litigation order to allow up to 800,000 more to join, and to open the door for major institutional investors that may have an interest. The case is being funded by unidentified specialist investors that support litigation claims. Adrian Lithgow, one of the founders of Lloyds Action Now, said: ""After five years of struggling against immense odds we have now got our case into court. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary savers had their lives wrecked by bankers and the Labour government when they were gulled into saving them from the financial crisis – a crisis of the government's and the bankers' own making."" Both Lloyds and RBS announced their first-half results last month. Lloyds profits more than halved, to £863m, while RBS reported its highest first-half profits since its bailout, at £2.6bn."
1714	1715	City watchdogs broaden HBOS inquiry 	"The main City regulators have warned former managers of that they faced possible fines and being banned from the Square Mile after they broadened their investigation into one of Britain's most infamous bank failures. The and the Prudential Regulation Authority said a review of staff conduct before the £47bn of losses that came to light in 2008 would go beyond the top bosses identified in a previous inquiry. Setting out the detailed terms of reference for the investigation, they said officials would look into ""whether the regulators should consider afresh whether any other former members of HBOS's senior management should be subject to investigation with a view to prohibition proceedings"". The much-delayed attempt by regulators to review what was arguably Britain's most reckless bank before the financial crisis has frustrated MPs and the public. Last year the parliamentary commission on banking standards published an official report that was deeply critical of the chairman Lord Stevenson, chief executive Andy Hornby and his predecessor , saying their ""toxic"" mistakes had led to the ""colossal failure"" of the bank. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chaired the commission, suggested that further sanctions could be needed, saying: ""Those responsible for bank failures should be held more directly accountable for their actions and face sanction."" So far the regulator has only fined and banned Peter Cummings, the former head of its commercial property arm which ran up debts of more than £20bn. Cummings fought the regulator, saying that he conducted his business in good faith and never foresaw the credit crunch, but he was fined £500,000 and banned for life from working in the City. Stevenson, Hornby and Crosby have all faced parliamentary humiliation under questioning by MPs. Crosby was stripped of his knighthood and resigned as a regulator, Hornby handed back some of his income and Stevenson left the City. In the aftermath of the report, the business secretary, Vince Cable, threatened to review their conduct with a view to possibly banning them as company directors. However, they have never faced sanction by regulators and any further action was delayed after the government announced that the Financial Services Authority, which started the inquiry, would close and hand over to its two successors. Crosby, who sold two-thirds of his shares just before the banking crisis hit and the bottom fell out of their value, has continued to receive a pension, expected to be almost £700,000. Hornby continues to play a part in business life and enjoys a £240,000 HBOS pension. The regulators said the FSA was only allowed to begin its review of staff culpability in September 2012 while it waited for its own assessment of the bank's failure to be completed. They said a decision on which directors to pursue would be made before the end of the year and would include a full report on why HBOS failed and which agencies were to blame."
1724	1725	Under-fire FCA spells out its targets for the year ahead 	"A review of how firms can prevent traders manipulating key benchmarks in a bid to stop a new Libor scandal and an investigation into how lenders treat borrowers who have fallen behind on repayments are among the City regulator's plans for the year ahead. The publication of the Financial Conduct Authority's business plan comes days after it came under fire for its . It was forced to announce an external investigation after news that it would look into the companies' treatment of long-standing customers caused dramatic falls in their share prices. The chairman of the Treasury select committee, Andrew Tyrie, said the way the regulator released the information – via a press interview – appeared to be an ""extraordinary blunder"", and the George Osborne, to complain. Amid the clamour, the FCA on Monday confirmed it would be looking into the industry: ""We will assess whether firms are operating historic (often termed 'legacy' or 'heritage') products in a fair way and whether they have adopted strategies that exploit existing customers."" The regulator highlighted its plans for a thematic review of whether firms have learned lessons from Libor and other recent controversies and set adequate controls on traders' behaviour to prevent future manipulation of benchmark rates. ""Following widespread attempted manipulation of Libor, firms should ensure that traders are not able to act in this way in the future,"" the FCA's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, said. ""We are determined that firms need to take the matter of manipulation of any benchmark seriously and will be working with firms to seek out any issues that may remain."" The FCA takes over regulation of the consumer credit sector on Tuesday, and it also outlined plans for a review of how struggling borrowers are treated by the industry, and how loans are advertised. It has already signalled that it plans to get tough on the payday lenders that offer short-term loans at high interest rates, with new restrictions set to come into force in July, and it said it planned to visit the top five firms to check they are following the rules. Wheatley said: ""Taking on the regulation of consumer credit is an enormous task which effectively doubles the number of firms we regulate. ""Using our new power we want to tackle harm to consumers who are most at risk and our work will focus on protecting vulnerable consumers."" Other reviews outlined in the plan include: How banks have implemented rules on selling packaged bank accounts introduced in March 2013 The impact on consumers of cost-cutting exercises such as withdrawing paper statements Whether victims of unauthorised transactions are treated fairly Sales practices at retirement How lenders are treating interest-only mortgage customers Possible conflict of interest in wealth management firms where customers buy in-house investments The FCA also set out its budget for the year ahead, saying it needed £446.4m to fund its work, an increase of 3.3%, or £14.3m, on the current year's costs. It said the minimum fee for companies would be £1,000 for the fifth year running and that 42% of firms would only pay that figure."
1725	1726	George Osborne 'profoundly concerned' by FCA insurance leak 	"George Osborne, on Tuesday told the it should consider disciplinary action against staff after last week's botched announcement of an investigation into the insurance sector. Putting renewed pressure on the new City watchdog's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, the chancellor used unusually strong language, saying he was profoundly concerned about the events that The share sell-off followed a senior FCA director Clive Adamson being quoted in the Daily Telegraph on plans to review 30m policies going back decades and the potential scrapping of exit fees on such policies. The story sent shudders through the stock market but the FCA then failed to clarify the scope of its inquiry until six hours after trading opened. Wheatley said he had no intention of resigning from the £600,000-a-year job he formally took on a year ago when the new regulator was broken out of the former Financial Services Authority. But Osborne's unexpected intervention on Tuesday led to speculation that senior FCA jobs were on the line. The Treasury – which appointed Wheatley – released a , John Griffith-Jones, in which Osborne wrote: ""These events go to the heart of the FCA's responsibilty for the integrity and good order of UK financial markets, and have been damaging both to the FCA as an institution and to the UK's reputation for regulatory stability and competence."" Griffith-Jones replied to say that the FCA shared those concerns and would ""do everything possible to address that harm by setting up an independent inquiry"". As Osborne, who is to appear before Treasury select committee on Thursday to talk about the budget, also received a letter from the Association of British Insurers demanding that the promised investigation by the FCA was truly independent. Signed by Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Prudential who is also chair of the ABI, the letter called for the industry, its regulators and the government ""sit down and have a longer term dialogue about how we can work together in future"". Wheatley, in a series of interviews on Tuesday to mark the moment that the FCA took on regulation of consumer credit, acknowledged that last Friday – repeating what he had told a City audience on Monday. But he also said he did not consider resigning. ""Yes, I will stay in my job. We've got a big job to do,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. The FCA boss is expected to be in Westminster on Wednesday to host a reception with parliamentarians to explain the new approach to regulating the credit industry, previously overseen by the Office of Fair Trading. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has already described last week's release of information as an ""extraordinary blunder"". He said he intended to call before his committee the individual appointed to oversee the FCA inquiry to explain the regulator's actions. ""The Treasury committee will want to see the independent reviewer before he or she gets to work and before the terms of reference are finalised,"" Tyrie said. Osborne welcomed the FCA's decision to hold an inquiry, but set out seven questions to be answered, including who authorised the briefing and ""where senior accountability should lie and what disciplinary action should be taken""."

When she was 13, her parents moved from the small town of Twin Falls, Idaho, to Fairfax in Virginia because of her father's job with the United States Forest Service. Hendricks felt ""uprooted"" and resentful. Then she had to start at a new school: Fairfax High. She stood out from the beginning. In Twin Falls she had been part of a children's theatre group. She wore Birkenstocks and ""hippy dresses"". She was surprised when she saw the other girls her age in Fairfax ""carrying purses [handbags]. I was like, 'Ooh, purses!' To me, only moms had purses. They were much more sophisticated and they were having sex and wearing makeup – all these things that had not happened for me."" From the start, Hendricks was bullied. ""We had a locker bay, and every time I went down there to get books out of my locker people would sit on top and spit at me. So I had to have my locker moved because I couldn't go in there… I felt scared in high school. It was like . There was always some kid getting pummelled and people cheering."" Hendricks found refuge in the drama department. Acting provided an outlet for a feeling of impotent rage. She became a goth, dying her hair black and purple, shaving it at the back and wearing leather jackets and knee-high Doc Marten boots. Were her clothes a type of armour against what she was experiencing? ""Yeah, exactly,"" she says, nodding. ""My parents would say, 'You're just alienating everyone. You'll never make any friends looking like that.' And I would say, 'I don't want those people to be my friends. I'm never going to be friends with the people who beat up a kid while everyone is cheering them on. I hate them.'"" Fast-forward 26 years and Christina Hendricks is now one of the most recognised, acclaimed and lusted-after women in the world. , the sassy 60s secretary who rises to be partner of an advertising agency in the hit series , has won her critical plaudits, Emmy nominations and the slathering admiration of a legion of borderline-obsessive fans. At 39, Hendricks is – unusually for a female celebrity – loved in equal measure by men and women. Much has been made of her extraordinary looks that hark back to a bygone age of glamour – her curves, her auburn hair (dyed red because she loved as a child) and her translucent skin. A 2010 poll of female readers for magazine named her ""the "". Googling her name will throw up websites called things such as "" "" and a Tumblr devoted to answering the question "" "", which resolves modern etiquette dilemmas by channelling Hendricks's character in (on relationships: ""Anyone who you have to convince to be with you isn't worth convincing""). When I told people I was interviewing Hendricks, a female friend pleaded with me to tell her she thought Hendricks was ""the ultimate woman since Eve"". ""Oh, that's so nice,"" Hendricks says, pressing her hands to her chest as if accepting a prize. ""Thank you."" Has she been shocked at the response to Joan and, by extension, to herself? I imagine it's a lot of pressure to have to live up to being the ultimate woman since Eve. ""I guess I was surprised,"" Hendricks says when we meet in Joe Allen, a basement restaurant in the theatre district on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. ""I watched what people responded to in Joan, and she's so many things, but I think it's her strength, resilience and confidence."" Has playing Joan rubbed off on Hendricks's personality? ""I hope so… I've got a little sass in me."" She narrows her eyes, tilts her head and smiles in what can only be described as a demonstration of uber-sass. ""I probably tend to get my feelings hurt more. I tend to take things personally. But I can only take so much and then I jump back. I have strong survival skills."" The key to Joan is that she establishes her power using her intelligence and the limited means available to her as a woman in an era of institutionalised sexism and unequal pay. I wonder: has Hendricks ever experienced sexism in the acting industry? ""Oh sure,"" she says, matter of factly. ""You know, it's difficult in the arts to pinpoint it but there's sexual harassment at work every single day, all day long. Certainly in the respect and position [of women], you feel like, 'Am I allowed to ask these questions or contribute in this way?'… Society has conditioned you that way. As women, we feel we can't ask for things. There's been a lot of research done recently and, more often than not, if a woman goes in to ask for a raise, she'll get it. But she's thinking, 'Do I deserve it? I've got to give a list of why I deserve it.' Whereas a man will just go in and ask for a raise. It's so scary."" Hendricks is promoting her new feature film, , directed by her colleague John Slattery (who plays Roger Sterling) and co-starring the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hendricks plays Jeanie Scarpato, a trapped housewife who never quite escaped her small town. Jeanie's son dies in the opening scenes and she becomes convinced the town is covering up the real story of his death. Her husband (Seymour Hoffman) tries to find out what really went on. A tale of violence, betrayal and grief ensues. She says it is difficult watching the film now, knowing that Seymour Hoffman has gone. He , shortly after the film premiered at Sundance. ""I was saying to my husband [the actor Geoffrey Arend] that sometimes when you have a friend who passes, it feels very, very final,"" she says, and her eyes become filmy as she turns away and stares at the tablecloth. ""But something about Philip… I keep thinking I'm going to see him again. I guess, when I watch the film now, I feel like it's a celebration of him. I feel lucky to have gotten to work with him. I feel grateful and I feel sad."" Was she shocked by his death? ""I mean, I was because he'd seemed so great… um… and, you know, we'd just been at Sundance with him the week before and he seemed fantastic. I knew he'd had problems in the past but I really did think it was in the past. I was so surprised."" Hendricks readily admits she was intimidated at the prospect of working with a man widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest actors of his generation, but ""he was incredibly warm and collaborative"" and it helped that Slattery was directing: ""It was very nice looking across the room and seeing each other's faces,"" she says. ""A little bit of reassurance in a sea of uncertainty."" Although the film opened at Sundance to mixed reviews, Hendricks's nuanced performance has been lauded (she was ""sorely under-utilised"", according to one critic). Indeed, Hendricks has such onscreen charisma that whenever she appears in a scene, it is difficult to look at anyone else. The character of Joan in started out as little more than a feisty secretary, but as audiences began to respond to Hendricks, the writer Matt Weiner developed her role so that by the end of series seven she had become a complex, fully-rounded character and a linchpin of the entire show. The same thing happened with , Nicolas Winding Refn's action thriller starring Ryan Gosling as a getaway driver. Hendricks has only a small part as but, according to the 's Peter Bradshaw ""almost steals the picture"". In person, too, Hendricks is an arresting presence. When she arrives at Joe Allen, her trademark red hair obscured by a straw trilby, the waiters try to make a point of not staring but their mouths drop open anyway, as though their chins have been drawn towards the ground by some curious magnetic force. Hendricks is in jeans and a black silk top, low-cut enough to reveal glimpses of bra lace. She is swathed in a black scarf, accessorised with a long gold necklace, red lipstick and black eyeliner. The whole thing makes her look like a turn-of-the-century tarot card reader or a beautiful barmaid as depicted by Manet. There is a timelessness to her, a quality of otherness – the legacy, perhaps, of those long-ago schooldays when she refused to conform. She orders a steak tartare (""I like it spicy"") and glass of pinot grigio, and then insists I keep her company by getting a bloody mary. It's 2pm, and I'm working, but Hendricks is impossible to resist. I order the bloody mary. As we wait for our drinks, I suggest it must be satisfying to look back at those high-school bullies and see how far she has come. She looks at me levelly. ""You know, I had so much anger about that time, that experience, for so long and I don't know what dissipated it, but now it's gone. I feel some sadness about it, about how cruel kids can be to each other, but that's it."" She is still friends with three or four people from that period of her life. ""But I haven't gone to any reunions."" She shrugs. ""I'm sure, if I did, they would have no idea I went there. No idea."" It is, you can't help but feel, very much their loss. When she was growing up, Hendricks never thought of acting as a proper career. She'd been appearing in local theatre productions since the age of nine, along with her older brother, Aaron, and yet, she says: ""I know it sounds naive but I didn't know it was a job. I thought it was a hobby."" At the hair salon where she worked as a teenager in Fairfax, the customers kept saying she should be a model. Eventually her mother, Jackie, entered her daughter's photo into a competition to appear on the cover of magazine. She didn't win but she got down to the final 10. At 18, she signed with an agency and left Fairfax to live in New York. She remembers ""growing up real fast"". In some respects, Hendricks was already used to going it alone. Her parents split up when she was in her much-hated high school – ""I always thought they were going to get a divorce,"" she says now. ""I was surprised it took them so long"" – and New York gave her a chance to get out of Virginia and away from the locker bay. She was a successful model, travelling the world and living for a year in London, in a flat just off Holloway Road. Her father, Robert, was born in Birmingham and she has dual nationality, happily describing herself as an Anglophile. ""Although,"" she muses, ""I think the beer is stronger there than here. I have two beers in London and I'm, like, wasted."" In her mid-20s, she moved again, this time, with her mother, to Los Angeles. Hendricks was beginning to get a lot of commercial work on television ""because I wasn't a typical model. I wasn't 5ft 11in or a beanpole"". A manager friend of her brother's liked what he saw and asked to represent her as an actress. Hendricks agreed, on the proviso that she could take acting classes before going up for any auditions. ""He was really patient with me,"" she recalls, taking small mouthfuls of her steak tartare. ""So I just started studying. One year later I was watching some movie and I thought, 'I can do that.' So I called him up and said, 'I'm ready.'"" Hendricks got a number of parts in television series, including and , but nothing really took off. Then the script for n came across her desk and immediately she felt it was special. ""I love the idea I have a desk,"" she giggles now. ""It makes me sound very professional."" Both she and her manager wanted her to take the part of Joan. Hendricks's agency didn't agree. ""They said, 'It's a period piece, it's never going to go anywhere. We need you to make money and this isn't going to make money.' They ended up dropping me."" Hendricks was unruffled. ""I had been on several shows that were meant to be the big ones, that would go on for ever, and they didn't. So there was no sure bet and I'd already taken a chance on them and I felt, why not do the one you're in love with and take a chance on that?"" It was a gamble that paid off spectacularly well. The first season of aired in 2007 and was an instant success. Hendricks remembers taking her mother and her best friend to the screening of the pilot episode and being unsure whether audiences would get it. ""I turned to them and said, 'Is it good?' And they both said, 'Oh yeah, it's good.' I said, 'Is it boring?' and my mother said, 'No, but I didn't like that he [Don Draper] was cheating on his wife at the end.'"" Hendricks laughs. ""And I thought, 'Oh no, she's going to hate the show.'"" After eight years of Joan, Hendricks has just wrapped filming on the series finale. She has several more films in the pipeline and wants to do some theatre – ""I want to do everything!"" – but has seen her through her 30s and saying goodbye has been a wrench. On the last day of filming, the cast gathered to applaud each other as they played out their final scenes and then they hung around ""chatting, singing songs, drinking"" until eight the following morning. ""We all just stuck around,"" says Hendricks. ""We didn't want to leave."" To compound the feeling of uncertainty and change, Hendricks and her hus band have just moved back to New York from LA. ""The move has been a really nice distraction,"" she says. ""I don't think it's fully hit me yet… We [the cast] all know each other more than most people on Earth know each other. A lot has happened these eight years. A lot of us have gotten married, bought homes, had children."" Hendricks met her husband in 2007, in the middle of the first season, through their mutual friend, Vincent Kartheiser, who plays 's Pete Campbell. They married two years later. ""So he has been on this journey with me, during which our lives have changed entirely,"" she says. ""He's been amazing. When people are like, 'How are you doing?' [putting on a mock-sympathetic face], he's like, 'She's sad… but she's .'"" Unlike many of her fellow cast members, Hendricks has decided she does not want children. She had ""a million conversations"" with Arend about it before they got married and feels very lucky that he agrees. ""I mean, they [children] are a lot of work."" Has she ever wanted to be a mother? She wrinkles her nose. ""I think in my mid-20s I did because I was moving around a lot and didn't have that sense of community, of being rooted."" When she has spoken about this in the past, she has been surprised by the fuss. ""Why? I know plenty of people who don't have children. And I also get a lot of people who say, 'Thank you for speaking out, my family don't understand why I don't want kids.'"" Instead, she and Arend have a dog, a beloved cockapoo called Zouzou. Hendricks takes out her phone to show me pictures. She says she had to take a mugshot of Zouzou recently ""because she's a service dog and they needed it for her ID"". A what? ""Service dog,"" Hendricks says again. ""So she can travel with me on aeroplanes."" Like a guide dog for the blind? She nods. ""She's an anti-anxiety dog."" Hendricks says this totally straight-faced but is that a twinkle in her eye? ""She calms me down,"" she says. And the air authorities are OK with that? ""You know, they're not legally allowed to ask the reasons,"" she replies, and then she shows me another photo of Zouzou in a smart green bib that they bought specifically to make her look ""more formal"". It's clear that, with Arend and her anti-anxiety dog, Hendricks now has that rootedness she lacked in her 20s, helped also by the firm friendships she established through . ""I think, with the exception of and John Slattery, none of us were very well known [at the beginning]. We've watched our anonymity being taken away. That's where we are a protective family unit."" The fame is still a strange thing. Hendricks compares the sometimes nerdish preoccupation of fans – not unkindly – to the sci-fi community. ""They're incredibly passionate,"" she says, knocking back the last of her wine. ""So they always say really kind and nice things."" But she has an issue with the hullabaloo that goes along with being a modern-day celebrity. She dislikes ""the lack of respect for someone's privacy"" and the way people will suddenly shove a cameraphone in her face without warning. It happened the other night, when she was eating a bowl of spaghetti in a restaurant in London. ""So now – great – there's some horrible pictures of me chewing on meatballs. I've had more people come and say, 'Do you mind if I take a picture because my friend will never believe it.' Really?"" she says, exasperated. ""Why? Are you just a big liar? That's always the justification or excuse for it because it's not just a picture for them and their friend, it's a picture they're going to put on Facebook for their thousands of friends to look at."" She has a thin skin and hates the constant carping over fashion faux pas or what she perceives as the non-issue of her weight. ""I am too emotional,"" she admits. ""I do take things personally because someone is always wanting to criticise or say something negative. I don't know why it is. I'm sure there's tons of blogs out there about how horrible Meryl Streep is."" She guffaws at the thought. ""And we all know not true."" She's right that her physical attributes come up again and again whenever she is interviewed or written about. On one level you can understand why – in a world where wraith-like thinness in actresses is revered, Hendricks is full-blooded proof that gorgeousness can exist, and be embraced, in a different construct. Her costumes in – fitted dresses with nipped-in waists and knee-length pencil skirts worn over uncomfortable girdles and underwired long-line bras – only served to accentuate her hourglass figure and have influenced a host of fashion designers. On another level you can also see why Hendricks is fed up with talking about it, because it is demeaning to suggest that the success of any woman's work depends on her vital statistics rather than her talent. I've been asked by Hendricks's PR not to ask any questions about her body in the interview. But, obviously, I try to bring it up anyway. Hendricks spots the approach from a mile off. ""Don't do it,"" she says firmly, before I even get to the end of the sentence. She smiles but it's quite clear she means it. She finishes her raw steak and then places her knife and fork together on the plate. Just like Joan, there's a steely underwiring beneath that pale-skinned, blush-cheeked exterior. Hendricks can more than look after herself. Don't tell anyone, but I'm not sure she needs an anti-anxiety dog after all."
1748	1749	Vodafone paid no corporation tax in Britain last year 	", the world's second largest mobile phone company by revenue, paid no corporation tax in Britain last year. The blue chip company has distributed £4.8bn in cash dividends to shareholders in the last 12 months – more than any other British business – but generous tax breaks mean it was able to reduce its corporation tax bill to zero for the second consecutive year. Vodafone's annual report, published on Friday, also showed the chief executive, Vittorio Colao, collected £11m in pay last financial year. The total included salary, fees, a cash bonus, stock options, cash paid in lieu of a contribution to the company pension scheme and £30,000 in benefits, such as private healthcare and car allowance. Tough trading in southern Europe, which is bearing the brunt of the economic crisis in the eurozone andwhere Vodafone's businesses' operating profits have contracted by 28%, meant Colao missed some of his performance targets and will take home less than the £15.7m he earned in 2011-12. Despite being headquartered in Britain, Vodafone regularly pays more tax abroad than it does in its home country. Last year, the group's international tax bill totalled £2.6bn. Instead of being taxed at group level, UK law allows companies to be charged through their subsidiaries. Vodafone has many subsidiaries – the annual report lists 79 of them – each of which is taxed as a separate entity. In common with many other UK businesses, Vodafone's British operating company is able to shelter much of its profit from tax legally. The firm made a £294m operating profit in Britain last year, but was able to transform that into a loss. In common with other mobile phone networks, Vodafone claimed back part of the money it has spent on its network, building masts and laying cables. It also claimed back part of the cash it paid the government to buy the airwaves that carry mobile traffic, as well as interest charges on the money it borrowed to pay for them. ""This shows all that is wrong with the current system for taxing corporations, which has made tax almost a voluntary activity,"" said Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at the University of Essex. ""We have the fiction that hundreds of Vodafone subsidiaries all over the world are separate taxpaying entities, even though the company has common shareholders, a common board, and common strategy. It should really be treated as a single economic entity so that none of this profit would escape tax."" Although Vodafone's tax bill for the year was zero, a recalculation of money owed for previous years meant it received a £24m bill from HM Revenue and Customs. This compares to a £4m credit for recalculated tax last year. In a nine-page document published as a defence of its tax position, Vodafone said it contributed £11.1bn in 2011-12 to public finances in the countries where it operates. This figure includes corporation tax, but also spectrum fees, incidentals such as vehicle excise duty and the income tax collected from some staff. ""Individuals and companies have legal obligations to pay tax,"" the document states, ""but those obligations do not extend to paying more than the amount legally required. Companies also have a legal obligation to act in the interests of their shareholders. Vodafone's shareholders include many of the investment funds relied upon by tens of millions of individual pensioners and savers."" Vodafone's stock price has risen 13% since last June. It is the largest dividend payer in the FTSE 100, thanks to its 45% ownership of the US mobile network Verizon Wireless, which has itself been paying generous dividends to Vodafone. In light of the economic crisis in Europe, where Vodafone was forced to write down the value of its Italian and Spanish operations by £7.7bn, Colao's pay is to be frozen for a second year running, along with that of most of his top team. ""When considering what, if any, pay increases to award, the committee is always mindful of both wider conditions as well as what is happening elsewhere within Vodafone,"" Luc Vandevelde, the chairman of the remuneration committee, wrote in the annual report. Colao's annual salary and fees were worth more than £1m this year. In addition he received £333,000 cash in lieu of pension. He received £8.25m in shares and a £1.313m cash bonus."
1754	1755	Debenhams to open Sports Direct concessions 	" is opening up its stores to Mike Ashley's Sports Direct after the billionaire retailer applied pressure on management by taking an option to buy a stake in the department store group. Sports Direct will launch concessions in Debenhams' Harrow and Southsea stores in August, with more likely to open before the end of the year. Ashley, who owns Newcastle United FC, when Sports Direct bought a 4.63% stake in Debenhams and called for the companies to work together. Sports Direct then cashed in its shares, making an estimated £5m, and using a complex financial arrangement. The deal left Ashley, known for his dealing in rivals' shares, able to influence the company without buying the shares outright. Analysts speculated that Ashley would put pressure on Debenhams to stock his sports brands, including Dunlop, Donnay and Lonsdale, alongside Debenhams' fashion clothing. Michael Sharp, Debenhams chief executive, said he had decided to bring in Sports Direct concessions because customers said there was not enough sportswear in his stores. He also announced that the Costa coffee chain would open six outlets in Debenhams stores next month and said the group was in talks with other brands on similar deals. Ashley pounced in January with Debenhams at a low ebb after it warned that dire Christmas trading meant its half-yearly profits would be more than 25% lower than in the same period last year. Rivals blamed it for pulling down pre-Christmas prices on the high street with heavy discounts and seemingly endless sales. In a trading update, Sharp said efforts to wean Debenhams off its promotion habit were starting to pay off. The group will start its summer sale two weeks later than last year on 26 June. In the 14 weeks to 7 June total sales were up 1.6% and sales at stores open a year or more rose 0.7%. Debenhams said its margins were improving in the second half of its financial year, which ends on 31 August. Sharp said: ""Our performance in the second half reflects the work we have done, particularly to refocus our promotional activity. Although early days, this strategy is delivering higher full price sales and we expect to see the benefit through gross margin progression in the second half of the year and in 2015. ""Looking forward, whilst it is clear that consumers are aware of improvements in economic indicators, they are not yet seeing a significant improvement in their disposable income. Our outlook for the full year remains unchanged."" Debenhams also said it wanted to sell £200m of bonds to investors to replace some of its bank borrowing. If the bond sale goes ahead, the company will write off £4.5m for fees paid to cancel existing bank debt. Next year's interest charge is also likely to rise by about £4m, but over the seven-year life of the bonds the group expects to save money."
1759	1760	Atlético Madrid 0-0 Chelsea 	There is no point dressing it up as something it was not. At this level it is rare to see such a lack of vibrant football, or so many occasions when passes are misplaced and two sides play with so little penetration. The setting was wonderful, in one of Madrid's great venues, with the Almudena cathedral as the impressive backdrop. The din was as good as it gets in Spain. It is just a shame the two sides produced such a stodgy game for the size of the occasion. , however, will not be too concerned if this match is added to the long list of games that is used to knock José Mourinho's ploys of conservatism and, ultimately, it is proven to be a valuable result. Nobody should be greatly surprised by their spoiling tactics and there is something to be said, once again, for their competitive courage in the face of a number of difficulties. Petr Cech's dislocated shoulder was a considerable setback and another followed in the second half when John Terry damaged an ankle. Yet Chelsea never wilted. Mark Schwarzer coped ably as Cech's replacement and the tie is poised nicely for the return leg, even if Chelsea's list of absentees probably means Atlético should still be regarded as marginally the favourites. Chelsea are certainly short of personnel given that Frank Lampard and Mikel John Obi both picked up yellow cards to mean they will be suspended. Gabi, the Atlético midfielder, will also be banned because of a yellow card but it is clearly not ideal for Mourinho that he now has to rely on Schwarzer for the remainder of the season. At 41 years and 128 days, the former Middlesbrough and Fulham goalkeeper became the oldest player to figure in the , taking Edwin van der Sar's record. The number-crunchers can also provide statistics that, in the history of the European Cup, show that the away side goes through after a 0-0 draw in the first leg in 67% of matches. What is clear is that it will need another performance of defensive expertise if Chelsea are to buck that trend. The Vicente Calderón stadium might not have the same gravitas as the Bernabéu or Camp Nou, but the acoustics are better and Diego Simeone's team, sitting defiantly at the top of La Liga, had the backing of a passionate and partisan crowd. It was a kaleidoscope of colour, with huge banners tumbling down from the vertiginous stands, and the acclaim that Fernando Torres received on his homecoming made way for raw spite when the turned their attentions to Mourinho. Yet Chelsea have silenced opposition crowds in Barcelona, Munich and Istanbul in the past few years, and their system, flooding midfield and breaking only sporadically on the counter-attack, had turned down the volume here, too, by the end. The style of play was designed to smother, with Torres often cutting an isolated figure, but Chelsea have great qualities of structure and organisation and they are entitled to play to their strengths, even if in doing so they made it a prosaic and disjointed match. On nights like these they are not an entertaining team but, in mitigation, they were also missing Eden Hazard while Torres would not have played had Samuel Eto'o been fit. They might not satisfy the purists but these are the tactics, roughly speaking, that have Chelsea trying to reach their third European final in successive seasons. Cech was hurt as he jumped to turn a corner over his crossbar and David Luiz's push sent Raúl Garcia clattering into the goalkeeper while he was in mid-air. The fall was thudding and spectacular and Cech quickly signalled that he was unable to continue, needing extensive treatment before being led off with a blanket around the shoulder. Atlético must have been encouraged by the sight of Schwarzer in the opposition goal, but his handling was immaculate and there was no sign of nerves in the biggest match of his club career. Chelsea's defence also did a fine job of keeping out Spain's top team. Ashley Cole did not look like a man who has been marginalised so abruptly this season. A considerable bit of Terry's thou-shall-not-pass mentality has rubbed off on Gary Cahill, and César Azpilicueta rose to the occasion. His block, as Diego Costa was shaping to shoot, was typical of the way Chelsea set about the opening half. What they did not possess was a cutting edge. They failed to manage a shot on target until Lampard's effort early in the second half, and Atlético's fans could be forgiven for wondering when, or where, Torres lost his sureness of touch. Willian and Ramires had the energy and pace to join him occasionally, but this is not a front three to terrorise opponents at this rarified level. Torres put a shot straight into the arms of Thibaut Courtois but Chelsea did little otherwise to see if their on-loan goalkeeper might have been affected by the fuss surrounding his involvement. For their part Atlético, despite vastly superior possession statistics, did not pass the ball penetratingly enough to put Schwarzer in any real danger.
1760	1761	David Moyes: a very brutal and modern sacking 	"hen was unveiled as Sir Alex Ferguson's successor after 27 trophy-laden years at Old Trafford, the rhetoric was almost biblical. One Scot passed the flame to his anointed countryman, exhorted the faithful to give ""the Chosen One"" time and emphasised the extent to which the club was not like any other. The end, just 10 months after a smiling Moyes walked into Old Trafford clutching a six-year contract, was brutal and underlined the extent to which can no longer differentiate itself. Yet despite a widespread acceptance in the club's boardroom that it had erred by so hastily agreeing to Moyes's coronation by his predecessor, and in particular in ignoring the claims of the flamboyant José Mourinho, it has emerged that Ferguson will again play a key role as kingmaker in recruiting Moyes's replacement. A spectacular fall from grace on the pitch – from first to seventh, playing dour football that is anathema to fans who feasted on success throughout the Ferguson era – will also lead to renewed scrutiny of the club's controversial US owners, the Glazer family, away from it. If the stakes were high a year ago, when rookie vice-chairman Ed Woodward said Moyes was ""cut from the same cloth as the Old Trafford greats who go before him"", now they are that much higher still. Ryan Giggs, the playing legend employed as a coach by Moyes but estranged from him by the time the axe fell, will take charge for the final four matches of the season but will not get the job permanently. Instead, the Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal, Atlético Madrid's Diego Simeone and Real Madrid's are among the names on the shortlist. In Germany, Bayern Munich's and Borussia Dortmund's charismatic Jürgen Klopp were quick to rule themselves out. Mourinho, who many feel would have jumped at the chance a year ago, is now at Chelsea. All told, it is a bit of a mess. The Glazers' leveraged business model, estimated to have cost United £680m in interest and fees since they took over in 2005, requires consistent success on the pitch to keep the global sponsorship deals rolling in and the tills ringing. With season-ticket renewals due, and said to be disappointing, and a long-delayed £600m kit deal still in negotiation, the Glazers felt their hand was forced ahead of a make-or-break summer of transfer dealing in which they have promised –uncharacteristically – to spend big. The club regularly trumpets new money-spinning sponsorship deals that crisscross the globe and claims to have a somewhat improbable 659 million ""followers"" around the world. But without success on the pitch to drive it, that financial model will start to creak. The club's gloomy hierarchy decided in a short conference call after United's pathos-laden surrender to Moyes's former club Everton on Sunday that he must go immediately. A day of gathering rumours of his demise was followed by a terse Twitter statement on Tuesday morning. ""Manchester United has announced that David Moyes has left the club. The club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role,"" it said. If his unveiling was accompanied by flowery rhetoric about the club's glorious history and a ""commitment to the long term"", its termination was as messy, unsatisfactory and gloomy as the 10 months in between. Moyes had already described how he had fretted about his attire when Ferguson initially invited him round to discuss the biggest job in English football and how the colour had drained from his face when he was offered it. If that lack of boldness rang alarm bells over his suitability for the job, by the end he was completely overwhelmed by it. If it was a very modern sacking – the 10th of this Premier League season as clubs scrabble to retain their share of a new £5.5bn TV deal and maintain their position among Europe's elite to comply with Uefa's new financial rules – then the reaction was appropriately devoid of emotion. A combination of ""player power"" as he lost support in the dressing room and self-fulfilling crisis propelled Moyes inexorably towards the exit. It is one that , the former United captain turned Sky Sports pundit, said he found distasteful. ""I don't like it, it's not the way in which the club should portray itself,"" said Neville. ""It's the modern world, it's how things seem to be dealt with now, but I'm a traditionalist and I think it could have been dealt with a whole lot better."" Moyes will depart with a substantial payoff, although the £5m he will receive was capped as a result of a clause that restricted him to 12 months' compensation. But the money will do little to heal the wounded ego of a ferociously proud man whose reputation is unlikely to recover from his bruising Old Trafford experience. One by one he lost the dressing room, the fans and the boardroom. Although, by modern standards, the match-going faithful had remained remarkably patient in the face of humiliating home defeats to neighbours Manchester City and – United's bitter rivals who look to be on the way to their first title in 24 years. It is to Anfield that United fans are casting worried glances as they consider the speed with which that club slipped from its perch following the glory days of the 1970s and 1980s. As confidence in the team ebbed away and performances went from bad to worse, the Old Trafford hierarchy decided two months ago that they would have to abandon their rhetoric about putting in place a new dynasty and turn to the shortlist of elite hired guns who are habitually touted for the top jobs around Europe. The only history that was being repeated was the farce of Wilf McGuinness's tenure after he replaced Sir Matt Busby in 1969. He too found that his predecessor, who remained a very visible presence around Old Trafford – just as Ferguson has been regularly pictured in the stands – cast a long shadow and he visibly wilted under the pressure. Amid repeated calls for homegrown managers to be given a chance in the biggest jobs and for owners and chairmen to calm their itchy trigger fingers, the sacking of Moyes will reverberate loudly. It is unlikely a manager similarly untested in the top tier of European competition will again be entrusted with a big club. It also leaves Paul Lambert at Aston Villa as the last remaining top flight representative of the once-proud Scottish managerial mafia who have delivered a rich seam of success at English clubs down the decades. Unlike McGuinness, the increasingly haunted Moyes has also had to withstand the scrutiny of a 24-hour news cycle and judgment by social media which can be brutally unforgiving. The more cynical believed that, far from being a romantic choice, Moyes had been recruited because he was a cheap option who would not rock the boat and maintain the Ferguson model with minimal fuss and investment. By the time it emerged that he was out of his depth and had been deserted by even his most fervent supporters within the club it was too late. The wing of the United fanbase that has long campaigned against the Glazers, pointing to the hundreds of millions they have taken out of the club since 2005, were quick to seize on the sacking as evidence of a deeper malaise. The Manchester United Supporters Trust argued that it was only the managerial genius of Ferguson that papered over cracks in the squad caused by years of under-investment that has left them lagging behind European giants such as Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. ""The club can only spend money that it has and, unfortunately, the club's owners have spent hundreds of millions of the club's money on financial restructuring and debt payments and this has limited funds available for investment in the playing squad,"" said Must's chief executive, Duncan Drasdo. ""The quicker the owners realise that the club's current problems are underpinned by the ownership model rather than just the identity of the manager, the better."" In another reflection of the globalised nature of modern football, there was as much attention to United's share price on Wall Street as the effect on the playing staff. It rallied in early trading to its highest point since Ferguson announced his retirement in May, suggesting the decision to bring the curtain down on the Moyes era had at least found favour with investors. But keen students of Manchester United's history will also note that McGuinness, after a brief interregnum when Busby returned to steady the ship, was followed by Frank O'Farrell as the next full-time manager. He lasted less than 18 months. This article was amended on 23 April to correct some jumbled syntax."
1767	1768	Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa – review 	Alpha Papa, the big-screen debut of Steve Coogan's bumbling local DJ, is a lucky loser of a movie, a Walter Mitty tale in which the wannabe hero keeps reverting to type. The studios of North Norfolk Digital are under siege. A maniacal gunman has the staff held hostage. And yet, in the heat of this crisis, keeps returning to the microphone to ask his listeners whether a binman can reasonably expect a Christmas tip after he's refused to dispose of a broken toaster. Character is fate, as Heraclitus once said. You can take the man out of Mid-Morning Matters, but you can't stem the tide of his Mid-Morning chatter. First road-tested more than 20 years ago, Partridge is a Norwich-based DJ and sometime TV presenter who found his natural comedic home on radio and TV. All of which makes him utterly ill-equipped to play the role of hostage negotiator in a majorish motion picture. Alpha Papa is aware of this, insofar as it pokes fun at the conceit without ever quite justifying it. The plot is hubristically high-concept, juggling a vengeful DJ (Colm Meaney), a hard-arse cop (Anna Maxwell Martin) and a corporate Satan (Nigel Lindsay). But the film works best when its focus is tight. Tellingly, the most pleasurable scene is arguably the simplest: a extended closeup on Partridge as he drives through Norwich, mouthing along to Roachford's Cuddly Toy. Our hero's hair is wafting in the breeze, and his mouth is set in a vain little pout. His eyes, however, flicker with the unease of a man who realises that he is barely getting away with it; who suspects that the world does not see him as he sees himself. I think that Alpha Papa, by and large, gets away with it. It's knowing and it's funny, and Coogan's persona remains so perfectly realised that he's able to survive when the plot over-reaches and blows out the levels. In the fraught final moments, the film drops its thread and picks it up again. It blathers and it blusters and then comes flopping inelegantly over the finish line, an accidental hero, a winner by default. Maybe that's fitting; possibly even halfway intentional. Alpha Papa is the sort of hit movie only Alan Partridge could make.
1771	1772	Chelsea give José Mourinho permission to rest key names at Liverpool 	"The Chelsea hierarchy have given José Mourinho the green light to field a team at Liverpool on Sunday that reflects the club's priority as being the Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid three days later. Yet the go-ahead may have only briefly brightened the manager's mood after he was one of three members of staff charged by the Football Association over events during the Mourinho, who is still in the process of appealing against an £8,000 fine after being sent to the stands for the second time this season for re-entering the playing surface at Aston Villa last month, had offered a sarcastic appraisal of the performances of the referee, Mike Dean, and the general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited, Mike Riley, after the 2-1 defeat to Sunderland that has left his team outsiders in the title race. His claim that the former had put in an ""unbelievable"" performance has prompted a charge of improper conduct, with the FA arguing he had questioned the integrity of both figures. He and his assistant, Rui Faria, have until Monday to respond with the latter charged with two counts of improper conduct to risk a touchline or even a stadium ban given the perceived seriousness of his offences. The midfielder Ramires is likely to be absent for the rest of the domestic campaign after the FA charged him retrospectively with violent conduct. The Brazilian had flung his arm into Seb Larsson's face three minutes before the interval, an incident that apparently went unnoticed by Dean, with the midfielder now facing a four-match ban given it would constitute his second domestic dismissal of term. He has until Thursday to respond but would not have featured at Liverpool regardless as Mourinho makes the Champions League the priority in his selection, with his team to be comprised largely of players ineligible in midweek. Mourinho has been vociferous in his complaints about the scheduling of key domestic fixtures around European ties this season and reiterated his dissatisfaction after claiming to be baffled as to why the match at Anfield could not be played on Friday or Saturday to assist the last English club involved in European competition. Chelsea are second in the Premier League but, should they win at Anfield, it would effectively hand third-placed a route back into the title race, given Manuel Pellegrini's side will have games in hand on those above them. Mourinho had indicated he had ""to listen to the club"" but stressed his team were representing ""English football"", ""so I would play the players who are not going to play on Wednesday"" against Liverpool. Those plans were discussed with the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, and the sporting director, Michael Emenalo, en route back from Madrid with the pair, together with the chairman Bruce Buck, relaying the manager's plans to Roman Abramovich at a board meeting on Wednesday. It is understood the owner is content with the manager's thinking, with Mourinho's selection to reflect the midweek game ahead. Chelsea lost Petr Cech and to shoulder and ankle injuries at the Vicente Calderón, but while the lineup who will confront the leaders will not be first-choice, they could not be dismissed as ""weakened"". and Mikel John Obi, who are suspended in Europe after picking up their third bookings of the competition, are expected to start along with the cup-tied Nemanja Matic and Mohamed Salah. Branislav Ivanovic, who was banned in Spain, is likely to partner Gary Cahill in central defence in anticipation of playing there against Atlético, while Ashley Cole should begin his first Premier League game since 11 January. Arguably the only youngster who may feature would be Tomas Kalas, 20, who could fill in at right-back, though the young Czech has been a regular in the senior setup this season. The Premier League is unconcerned at the prospect of Mourinho's selection, as long as the majority of the players who take to the field are members of Chelsea's 25-man squad. Faria will be on the touchline at Anfield, though the Portuguese's furious reaction to the award of the decisive penalty on Saturday has been deemed particularly serious by the FA. It is alleged he used abusive and/or insulting words towards the fourth official, Philip Dowd, and that his behaviour following the referee's request that he leave the technical area amounted to improper conduct. ""The FA has designated this as a non-standard case due to the aggressive and/or threatening and/or serious nature of the reported behaviour,"" confirmed the governing body, with the sanction to be determined by a three-man commission. Mourinho is likelier to face another fine rather than a ban given off-field offences generally prompt off-field sanctions. are considering their responses to the three charges."
1774	1775	David Moyes sacked by Man Utd and replaced by Ryan Giggs 	"David Moyes has been sacked by after just 10 months in charge and replaced by Ryan Giggs who has been put in charge temporarily until the end of the season. Giggs, 40, has been combining playing with studying for his Pro-Licence, learning at the feet of the manager for the majority of his career at United, Sir Alex Fergsuon. The Welsh winger and Moyes are believed not to have seen eye to eye over the past season although the club was at pains to deny the rumour. BREAKING: The club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role. (part 2 of 2) United released a short statement at 8.30am on Tuesday morning saying: ""Manchester United has announced that has left the club. The club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role."" Giggs will now be in charge for the last four games of the season, beginning with Norwich at home in the 5.30pm kick-off on Saturday, followed by home games against Sunderland and Hull and finishing away to Southampton. Moyes drove into the club's Carrington training complex on Tuesday morning for a meeting with the chief executive Ed Woodward to make his departure official. Moyes's backroom staff of Steve Round, Jimmy Lumsden and Chris Woods are also likely to depart although Phil Neville may be kept on. The move, on Monday, came after the former Everton manager lost the support of United's owners, the Glazer family despite having been personally selected by Ferguson and been handed a six-year contract. United had insisted that Moyes was still their manager on Monday, but refused to deny widespread reports the Scot was to be dismissed. The former captain Gary Neville, who made over 600 appearances for United, . ""I have to say I find it repulsive the way these rumours break,"" Neville, who won 17 major trophies at Old Trafford, told Sky Sports. ""I don't like it, I'll never get used to it, even though this is the world we live in. It needs to be clarified pretty quickly by the club and they need to break rank and do what they don't usually do, which is make a statement pretty quickly. ""The weight and explosion of the information coming out concerns me. That club, for 20-odd years, contained and managed information. It was completely off the scale like nothing else that's happened at the club in 20 years."" Managers are already being linked with the job, foremost among them the Holland manager Louis van Gaal and the former United centre-half and Paris St-Germain coach Laurent Blanc. Carlo Ancelotti, who has also been touted as a possible successor to Moyes, was non-committal ahead of Real Madrid's Champions League semi-final meeting with Bayern Munich. ""I feel sorry for David Moyes, but that's the life of a football coach, sometimes it doesn't go well for you and you are sacked,"" he said. ""I'm sure Moyes is going to get another team and another opportunity, but I always feel bad when a coach is sacked. I am a little surprised because Manchester United don't normally do this."" The Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola, who is preparing his team for Wednesday night's meeting with Real in the Champions League semi-finals, said: ""I'm here. I'm comfortable. I want to stay two more years at Bayern."" The club's press officer added: ""Tell the people in England there is no chance."" The United players started leaving Carrington at around 1.30pm, but there was no sign of Moyes, who was thought to have left the site via a back exit away from the cameras. The coach Nicky Butt, who is expected to form part of Giggs' interim backroom staff, left via the main exit shortly after 2pm. The list of unwanted records broken during Moyes' time at the helm is as embarrassing as it is long. United will end the season with their lowest points total in history, they have not qualified for the Champions League for the first time in almost two decades and their home record this season is the worst since 1978. The Red Devils, who won the title by 11 points under Sir Alex Ferguson last year, are seventh in the Premier League with four matches left. During his tenure Moyes won 27, drew nine and lost 15 of his 51 games in charge. Had he not made a mess of the summer transfer window, he might have been better placed. The Scot pursued Barcelona's Cesc Fábregas when the Spaniard had no intention of leaving the Spanish club. Thiago Alcântara joined Bayern Munich ahead of United, while the club made a hash of their attempts to sign Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines , their bid of £28m for the pair being branded ""derisory and insulting"" by Everton. Baines stayed and United ended up buying Fellaini for £27.5m when they could have bought him for £4m less had they acted quicker."
1777	1778	Rouble’s dramatic decline gives Russia an economic headache 	 website that was going viral on Russian social networks last week shows the rouble-dollar exchange rate, the rouble-euro exchange rate and the price of Brent crude changing in real time against a backdrop of slowly breaking waves, as soothing music plays in the background. “Russian zen: meaningless and merciless”, reads the bottom of the page . It is a play on a famous quote that Russian revolt is “meaningless and merciless.” A zen-like calm is probably hard to come by for those watching the exchange rate and the price of oil: of more than 54 to the dollar last week after the Opec oil producers’ group decided not to reduce production, which would have bolstered sinking oil prices. Russia is especially vulnerable to those prices, since energy exports make up half of its budget, and on Monday its currency recorded its largest single-day decline since the Russian financial crisis of 1998. In all, the rouble has sunk by more than 40% this year as has been buffeted by sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis and steep falls in the oil price. By the end of the week Brent was hovering below $70 a barrel, down from more than $105 at the start of the year. The picture of Russia’s economic future is grim, despite the rosy outlook President Vladimir Putin tried to put on it in on Thursday. Inflation has been rising, and recession next year is all but certain. On Tuesday, the economic development ministry reduced its GDP growth forecast for 2015 from 1.2% to –0.8%. State-owned banks have sought help from the government after the Ukraine sanctions cut them off from the western financial industry and its cheaper credit. According to Vladimir Tikhomirov, an economist at Russian bank BKF, the two main factors responsible for Russia’s economic woes – sanctions and a low oil price – probably won’t change any time soon. “Oil has a stronger effect on the economy than sanctions, and the oil price and sanctions are speeding up macroeconomic processes that were already there,” Tikhomirov says. “The economy was slowing down due to structural difficulties even when oil prices were high. I think that next year there won’t be new sanctions but the current sanctions will remain; I think next year the oil price will be around $80 a barrel; and I think that the economy will shrink.” But although such worrying numbers have led many to wonder if Putin’s standoff with the west might weaken his grip on power, analysts caution that the banking system is still functional and unemployment remains low. While concern over the economic situation is growing, the population’s “cup of endurance,” as the Russian phrase goes, is nowhere near to overflowing. “I think a situation with the stagnation of manufacturing, the reduction of people’s real incomes and the rise in inflation – it will lead to Putin leaving power, but it could be in five years or in 10 years. There probably won’t be any positive changes before that,” says Konstantin Sonin, vice-rector and professor of economics at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. “People’s reserves of endurance are very large.” Yelena Tsereteli, an employee of state-owned Rosselkhozbank in the regional city of Kurgan, says that although her employer has reduced the amount of cash on hand for customer withdrawal, a run on the bank seems unlikely. But she has noticed customers taking out money to make investments in property, home renovations or cars. “In terms of exchanging roubles for dollars, this isn’t really happening, but people have started to withdraw their savings and put it into something else. They buy a car or something, because they worry that the money will devalue,” Tsereteli says. “Otherwise they open accounts with higher interest rates, so that inflation doesn’t eat their money.” A survey by the independent pollster Levada-Center found that 80% of Russians were worried about the country’s economic problems, especially rising prices and falling quality of life. Rising inflation – which went from 8.3% in October to 9.1% in November – has pushed up prices, since many consumer goods, especially food, are imported. A ban on food imports from the European Union, the US, Australia, Canada and Norway ordered by Putin in response to western sanctions, while popular among the more patriotically minded, has worsened the situation. According to Russia’s state statistics service, prices for fruits and vegetables went up by 8.7% in November. Although the Kremlin has announced an import substitution programme and promised that domestic production will step up to fill the gap, reforming Russia’s declining agricultural industry will be a difficult and time-consuming task. In the meantime, analysts say, banned importers are generally being replaced by suppliers located further away, with the result that transport costs are driving up prices. The government has begun taking steps to check rising inflation by burning some of its reported £269bn in foreign currency reserves, a good-sized pillow to cushion the economy’s fall. After Putin promised in his speech on Thursday that the government would take action against “speculators” who were fuelling the rouble’s fall, the central bank made its third large intervention of the week to defend the currency, allowing the rouble to rise to 52.4 against the dollar as trading opened on Friday. The central bank spent an estimated £1.6bn last week propping the currency up. According to Tikhomirov, attempts to rein in inflation will not be effective so long as the currency hasn’t stabilised and structural inefficiencies haven’t been addressed, especially in sectors such as utilities, where prices have been rising steadily for years. Nonetheless, Putin has argued that the devaluation of the rouble represents a “stimulus” for the economy, making Russian products more competitive on the world market. Indeed, large exporters outside the oil and gas industry, such as steel producer MMK, diamond miner Alrosa and fertiliser giants Acron Group and Uralkali, are seeing greater profits, according to independent analyst Timur Nigmatullin. He says that Putin is right – to an extent. If the rouble falls by 30% in a year, it can make Russia’s exports more competitive, but if it falls by 40% to 50%, it could lead to economic instability. The currency is currently poised between these two outcomes. “Here the key role is played by balance. If the rouble remains where it is, it could be good. If the rouble continues to fall, it could be bad,” Nigmatullin says. “If it falls, it will lead to negative factors, higher cost of credit, problems with buying equipment from abroad … and the instability of the financial system. Investors will see more risk.” At the same time, Nigmatullin argues that the financial situation of the majority of the population is not critical and several economic indicators are in fact positive. According to the state statistics service, real wages grew by 2.2% between January and October, GDP grew by 0.8% and the manufacturing index grew by 1.7%. The most salient number for political instability is unemployment, which remains low at about 5% and is not likely to increase, Nigmatullin says. But while Sonin agrees low unemployment will have a calming effect, he argues that this level of manufacturing growth “is essentially stagnation for a big country like Russia”. Real incomes will begin falling, he says. The question is how long people will put up with it. The answer appears to be a long time yet, according to Tikhomirov. “In the last few years, the income of the population grew a lot, wages and pensions grew very strongly compared to 10 years ago,” he says. “When they start to fall, there will be some time that the population will be prepared to grin and bear it: because of political reasons – but also because they have got a significant increase in income in recent years.”
1778	1779	Dixons Carphone to keep on 800 Phones 4u staff 	"Up to 800 Phones 4u staff are to keep their jobs after received the all-clear to offer jobs to workers who had been operating mobile phone concessions in its PC World and Currys outlets. A further 4,200 jobs remain at risk after Phones 4u fell into administration on Monday. Administrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers have said there is enough cash to pay staff for another day and they could begin to lay off workers and permanently shut down parts of the business from Thursday if buyers for all or part of the business are not found. The three administrators are talking with potential buyers for some of the group's 550 stores, including mobile operators EE and Vodafone, which by withdrawing their business from the chain. The concessions in a further 160 PC World and Currys stores ceased trading and reverted to the newly merged Dixons Carphone group when Phones 4u collapsed. The retailer said it wanted to take on all its staff and reopen as soon as possible. The concessions are likely to be rebranded under the Carphone name over time but PwC made clear the agreement with Dixons Carphone did not include the sale of stock or the Phones 4u brand name. It is understood the retailer has about 300,000 handsets in stock, which the administrators will either sell or return to manufacturers. Phones 4u's demise has also left . The retailer's insurance arm also fell into administration on Wednesday with the same team from PwC taking on the job. A spokesman said all policies were safe and claims would continue to be handled but there would be a short delay in processing them because of shop closures. Dan Schwarzmann, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: ""We would like to reassure all policyholders with an active Phones 4u Care or Premierplan mobile phone insurance policy that your policy remains in force in accordance with its terms and conditions."" Phones 4u Care customers can call a dedicated hotline, 0333-222 6730, for further information. Administrators said they were continuing to engage with a number of parties – likely to include coffee shops, e-cigarette sellers and nail bars, which operate from similar-sized outlets – about the future of Phones 4u's stores. EE and are also looking at buying up to several dozen of Phones 4u's standalone stores. The closure of all Phones 4U's outlets earlier this week is the biggest one-day shut-down of a chain since Woolworths collapsed in 2008 according to high street analysts Local Data Company. Vodafone and EE were accused on Monday of playing a central role in Phones 4u's downfall. The company's private equity owner, BC Partners, said Vodafone had behaved in a way ""designed to inflict the maximum damage"" on Phones 4u while it described EE's decision to withdraw its business from Phones 4u last week as surprising. Phones 4u sells mobile-phone contracts and handsets to consumers on behalf of operators but its business model has been irreparably damaged by networks deciding to open own-branded outlets instead. In an outspoken attack on Monday, Phones 4u's founder, John Caudwell, blamed the company's demise on its owners and former partners. ""It's astonishingly ruthless. Vodafone have had millions upon millions from Phones 4u over 25 years. It's dreadful for British business. Sources close to one of the mobile operators said that they had made clear for some time that they were reviewing their relationship with Phones 4U and discussions had broken down after the retailer refused to offer improved terms on a historic agreement. Meanwhile a group of Phones4U bondholders said they would look into launching a rescue plan for the company. A spokeswoman for the bondholders said: ""We have proposed a restructure of the business that means the capital structure will no longer be an impediment to achieving the commercial outcome which allows the company to continue as a going concern."""
1780	1781	Phones 4u won't be the last casualty as the smartphone boom goes bust 	"on't be fooled by the scenes of people queueing at Apple stores around the country last Friday to bag the latest iPhones. The reality is that the phone business in this country is shrinking and Phones 4u, the nationwide retailer that collapsed into administration last Sunday night, is only the first casualty. The retail chain, which grew out of the company John Caudwell founded in 1987, was killed off because the mobile networks didn't want to give Phones 4u £100-£150 for every customer it signed up. They are having to fight for every customer and penny of revenue and profit right now, and they'd rather keep the money. Caudwell said the decision by Vodafone and EE to stop allowing Phones 4u to sell phones that connect to their networks was ""astonishingly ruthless"". He blamed them, along with the chain's private equity owners, for Phones 4u's destruction. The entrepreneur's comments caused amusement in the industry, where he and the company he used to own (he sold it to private equity business BC Partners for £700m in 2011) had a reputation for tough dealmaking. Vodafone , buying up 140 stores to bring its own chain up to 520 shops (and saving the jobs of 900 Phones 4u staff); more stores could be sold to EE, which is in talks with the administrator. Ruthlessness has become the network owners' watchword now, because the mobile phone boom they have ridden for nearly 20 years is over. They guard their cashflow increasingly jealously, and one particular sticking point that led to the collapse of Phones 4u is understood to have been the chain's insistence that if it signed a customer up to a network, it should get the entire commission upfront, rather than piecemeal over the life of a 24-month contract. (Carriers had a ""clawback"" clause in case customers abandoned the contract.) Back in the mid-1990s, when Phones 4u and Charles Dunstone's Carphone Warehouse aimed to cash in on the first mobile phone boom, carriers were scrambling to sign up customers as handsets from Nokia and Sony attracted the masses. The carriers were happy for retailers to sign up customers for them: the retailers got a cut of the contract over its lifetime, the customer got a phone, the carrier got a customer. While the phone business was good, everyone benefited. Then, just as the boom was petering out, smartphones arrived on the high street – first from Apple in 2007 and then from HTC and Samsung – kicking off a second surge. Now, though, that too is slowing. Data from shows that the UK is fast approaching ""smartphone saturation"", with roughly 75% of people who own a handset already owning a smartphone. According to researchers CCS Insight, smartphone ownership will hit 90% by the end of next year; but handset sales will fall 11% this year, after having slipped 4% last year, because people are hanging on to them for longer. The logic of cutting out middlemen – at least, uncooperative ones – has become irresistible. Ofcom's data shows that average revenue per user for mobile networks fell from £16.13 in 2012 to £15.26 by March 2014, while the total number of subscribers (including businesses) fell very slightly from 83.4 million to 83.2 million. That fall in revenue per user translates to £75m of lost sales for the carriers, even as they try to upgrade their networks to 4G and cope with cuts to roaming prices and charges to connect to other networks forced on them by European and UK regulators. Phones 4u's collapse ""reiterates the challenges of bricks-and-mortar trading following the collapse of electronics retailer Comet in 2013,"" says Ben Wood, CCS's head of research. ""The loss of its fiercest competitor may appear to strengthen the position of , but the company should not underestimate the consequence of greater efforts by UK network operators to invest in their own stores, or the trend towards online purchasing,"" he adds. EE is understood still to be negotiating with a ""second tier"" of 30 companies, including Argos, which provide a notable number of fresh customers via their high street outlets. For the operators, though, running their own outlets brings many advantages. They don't risk geographical overlap with an aggressive intermediary, and they control the standards and quality of service. ""Let's just say that Phones 4u's interests weren't always aligned with the customers', or the networks',"" one source commented last week. The other growing rivalry to the high street chains is the internet, where more and more people order not just phones, but also sim cards for handsets they have bought themselves. ""Sim-only"" contracts benefit the carriers, which don't then have the capital costs of buying handsets, but also are cause for concern, since people can switch away from them without warning. Apple, in fact, is one of the prime beneficiaries of this change, as it sells its iPhones directly from its stores – a move that Samsung, its biggest rival, has been seeking to emulate by opening another 15 UK outlets. Unfortunately, they were inside Phones 4u outlets. So is even Dixons Carphone, the £3.8bn merged company from the high street chains of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse, at risk from carriers seeking to claw back profit? There are two signs that it should be worried. First, the Three network stopped selling its handsets through Carphone Warehouse in 2013; it had done the same with Phones 4u in April 2012. Second, EE has not yet completed its negotiations on a new deal – exactly the problem that eventually led to the domino effect that killed Phones 4u. However, industry sources outside EE suggest Dixons Carphone is likely to survive. First, Dunstone holds huge sway, and is courted by handset makers around the world. ""He will have been over there in Cupertino for Apple's launch last week,"" said one source outside the company. ""He's a power in the industry."" Second, Dixons Carphone also has the advantage that it doesn't rely solely on mobile sales; it sells computers, tablets and related accessories as well, giving it a cushion against any network withdrawing support. And while Dixons Carphone might not sell Three handsets, it does sell its data-only sims for tablets, and the two are said to be in talks about creating a mobile virtual network operator, just as Virgin uses EE's network. For the Apple customers who had preordered their new iPhones through Phones 4u before the administrators were called in, the news that they are just casualties of the broader phone market won't be much compensation. In the future their experience – and the sight of shuttered shops – are likely to be more common than the whooping crowds around Apple's stores."
1783	1784	Venice film festival lineup sees Gilliam and Glazer back in from the cold 	Two fallen heroes of British cinema have found a sanctuary at this year's Venice film festival after organisers handed competition slots to the talented, wayward directors Terry Gilliam and Jonathan Glazer. Gilliam returns to the fray with his first film since 2009's ill-starred , which had to be patched together following the death of its lead actor Heath Ledger. In the case of director Glazer the wait has been even longer. It is nearly a decade since his previous picture, Birth, crashed at the box office back in 2004. Gilliam's new film, The Zero Theorem, stars Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz as a reclusive maths genius and showcases supporting performances from Ben Whishaw and Tilda Swinton. Glazer's Under the Skin, adapted from the 2000 novel by Michel Faber, features as a flesh-eating alien, hunting hitch-hikers in the wilds of northern Scotland. Other films selected for competition include James Franco's adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel Child of God, Kelly Reichardt's eco-terrorist drama Night Moves, and David Gordon Green's Joe, in which Nicolas Cage headlines as a Mississippi tree poisoner. Veteran Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki returns with the aviation drama Kaze Tachinu, while Errol Morris looks set to stoke controversy with The Unknown Known, a documentary about the former US defence secretary . British director Stephen Frears will also be in Venice competition with his new film Philomena. Frears's fact-based adoption drama stars Judi Dench as a mother in search of the son she gave up. The festival opens with Alfonso Cuaron's , an existential sci-fi thriller that features George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as imperilled astronauts aboard a stricken space shuttle. Elsewhere, there are out-of-competition slots for Kim Ki Duk's provocative, blood-soaked Moebius, which has already scandalised the ratings board in the director's native South Korea, and Paul Schrader's trouble-plagued , an erotic drama scripted by Bret Easton Ellis that pairs Lindsay Lohan with porn star James Deen. It remains to be seen whether festival controversy will be confined to the screenings. Outraged by the government's decision to cut a tax credit that can offset up to 5m-euros of an Italian film's budget, industry groups are planning a series of demonstrations on the Venice Lido. that any festival screening attended by government ministers are likely to be met with a mass choreographed walk-out. Gillam and Glazer, it would seem, are not out of the woods quite yet. The 70th runs 28 August-7 September.
1788	1789	Phones 4u in U-turn over iPhone 6 refunds 	Customers who preordered Apple’s through Phones 4u before it collapsed have been told they will not receive a refund. The announcement, by adminstrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), means that customers could lose up to £700 on orders which cannot be fulfilled because the retailer was shut before the phones could be issued. At least 130 Phones 4u customers have been affected. Phones 4u went into administration on 15 September, four days before the iPhone 6 and its larger version, the 6 Plus, went on sale. The retailer had allowed people to preorder the devices on its site until it was forced to close after mobile phone networks withdrew their businessfrom the company. Initially PwC had said customers who had preordered the phones would be entitled to cancel their order and receive a full refund. But now PwC says that because did not supply any iPhones to Phones 4u, it cannot honour orders. Instead, those who ordered through the company will be treated as unsecured creditors. PwC has advised those who paid for the preorder with a credit card to contact their card issuer, which can be liable to make a refund under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. “Unfortunately we do not have any iPhone 6s. Therefore customers who have preordered an iPhone 6 through Phones 4U will not receive their purchase,” it said. PwC did not respond to questions about how many people would be affected. Phones 4u shut after the mobile network EE became the last to withdraw support from the nationwide550-store network, threatening nearly 5,600 jobs. However, Vodafone, EE and electricals retailer Dixons Carphone bought more than 350 outlets, safeguarding more than 2,000 jobs. A Carphone Warehouse spokesperson said: “We understand Phones 4u customers have been told they won’t receive a refund on iPhone 6 pre-orders. We don’t think that’s fair, so we are offering to reimburse Phones 4u customers for any money paid upfront when they buy their new iPhone 6 or 6 Plus from us. All they have to do is come into our stores with printed evidence of their pre-order.”
1796	1797	Next chief executive warns on recovery 	"The UK will not enjoy a sustainable recovery until people stop getting poorer, Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of , has warned. He said the high street was benefiting from a more buoyant housing market and more confident consumers. But he warned: ""In real terms, people are still getting poorer. The retail economy has benefited from the elimination of the credit squeeze but that needs to be translated into growth of real earnings."" Wolfson said there was every chance a wider recovery would emerge, but it would take at least a year. ""It is a mistake to believe we are in the recovery now,"" he said. Next has revealed a 2.2% rise in sales over the most recent six months, while profits rose 8.2% to £272m. The company said it had lost several million pounds worth of sales because it had run out of summer clothing in August during the heat wave, but benefited from being more adventurous with its fashions and responsive to trends. Next was also helped by an improvement in the housing market which boosted sales of its furnishings. But Wolfson warned: ""For house price rises to translate into meaningful underlying growth this increase in activity must be converted into house building rather than price rises."" He said price rises would give the economy ""a problem"" because they were unsustainable. Next appears to be taking a bet that the housing market will continue to do well as the retailer wants to add 1.4m sq foot of retail space in the next three years, much of which will be in out of town retail parks. Most of these will be store extensions as Next wants to increase its four fashion and home and garden stores to 33, 12 more than it previously promised. While Next is seeing strong growth online, Wolfson said that physical stores were still profitable and popular with shoppers with 38% of online orders picked up on the high street"
1802	1803	Gravity: I love you George Clooney but you make me sick 	"My head is spinning and my stomach is lurching. Oh George, what have you done to me? It's the beginning of Gravity and George Clooney and are playing astronauts on top of the world. Or are they? Turns out Bullock's character is feeling a tad peaky. You try holding down your lunch at zero G, she tells mission control. Uh oh. I feel your pain, sister. We're two minutes in and I'm starting to feel a bit iffy myself. But look at that view! Spread out below the spacewalkers is the blue planet, the Earth, as most of us have only ever dreamed of seeing it. Hang on though, it's above them. Oof, it's below them. Urrrrrrrrrk, it's above them again ... I should have known better. I was the annoying sister who always got to ride in the front seat because I was carsick. I've never been any good below decks. Computer games give me the willies. And I once got seasick in a surf flick. I'm fine on rollercoasters. I've been paragliding and jumped out of a plane. If I can see that I'm moving, no worries at all. The problem comes in movies like these when what my eyes are seeing and the movement my inner-ear balance system is sensing don't match up. DOES NOT COMPUTE, some pesky part of my brain starts shrieking and suddenly I'm sick to the core. Turns out it’s called ""cybersickness"". Sounds kinda cool, huh? No. Really it isn't. I get flashes of it all day every day on my iPhone's iOS 7 when I press a button and the to fill up the screen. I'm not alone. Every few years a blockbuster 3D film comes out and a minority of cinemagoers . Some viewers, it turns out, have eye conditions that make it . Years ago I went to an Imax cinema and didn't like it much. When Avatar came out I braved for the first and – until now – only time. A third of the way into that film I felt a bit seedy, so necked an anti-nausea drug I had in my bag and came through unscathed. And so here I am, back at the multiplex, drawn in by gorgeous George and America's sweetheart and about an out-of-this world thriller. I've rounded up a bunch of mates and swallowed my anti-vom pill. At five minutes in, I'm feeling a little off. It will get better when they stop all this spacewalking malarkey and get inside their spacecraft, I think. I try taking off the 3D glasses but it does no good. By 10 minutes in, I'm watching mostly from between my fingers. I've a developed a profound distaste for the swelling score – it's matched to the swirling movement. After 15, I'm feeling as though I might really disgrace myself and wondering if I should walk out before I do. My friends all seem to be enjoying it, though, and I don't want to worry them. Besides, I want to know how it ends. I resolve to keep my eyes shut and peek only when the music dies down. So that's how I watch Alfonso Cuarón's towering achievement, being acclaimed for its dazzling cinematic . As a radio play. When it finally, FINALLY, finishes I stagger out to the foyer. The noise of queuing crowds, and the escalators carrying them up from the shopping centre below, is overwhelming. It takes me 10 minutes to regain my equilibrium so I can make it back to the car. I spend the next three hours in a dark room. Even now, 24 hours later, I'm still not up to par. In fact, I've been downright queasy all day. Every second bus stop has a poster and Sandy and George are everywhere promoting the film. And I have to stop writing because scrolling up and down this screen is making my stomach turn. George, George, what have you done to me?"
1804	1805	Italian finance minister: Europe must act now to avoid stagnation 	Italy’s finance minister has warned that time is running out for Europe’s tottering economies to avoid stagnation. Speaking on the eve of a national strike in Italy and after figures showed the country’s industrial production fell yet again in October, he said: “There isn’t much time. is at a fork in the road. One path leads to stagnation; the other to growth that we sorely need.” In a frank interview with the Guardian and other European news organisations, Pier Carlo Padoan attacked the European Investment Bank (EIB) for worrying more about its credit rating than about promoting growth and revealed he had been discussing with Brussels new rules to encourage government spending that underpinned structural reform. On Thursday in there were violent clashes as millions of workers joined the nationwide stoppage in protest at the government’s employment law reforms. Padoan’s message for them was that there would be no U-turns. Earlier this month, parliament approved a bill giving Matteo Renzi’s government a free hand to introduce by decree greater flexibility into the labour market. But until now it has been unclear whether Italy’s left-right coalition, under pressure from the left wing of Renzi’s Democratic party, would use its powers to the full. Padoan was unequivocal, saying: “The decrees are already prepared and they are such as to render extremely clear the direction: not to water down. No reform is going to be watered down.” He gave a guarded welcome to the plan sponsored by European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to inject extra investment cash into the European economy from June. But Padoan warned that “June is a long way off for the time-scale of the economy”, saying something had to be done in the meantime. One possibility was to mobilise the EIB. He added: “The problem with the EIB, as you know, is that it has a very prudent attitude to investment because, to protect its triple A [rating], it does not want to take on, let’s call it, excessive risk. “In my opinion – and not just mine – the ‘Bank of Europe’, as they love to call themselves, could be a little bit more aggressive; a bit more proactive.” Under the Juncker plan, which has been met with widespread scepticism, the commission and the EIB would provide guarantees of €21bn (£16.7bn) to raise €65bn in loans for selected projects, in turn attracting private capital to bring the total to €315bn. But Padoan warned that not all investment projects were good. He said: “I would like a European mechanism that takes on the task of evaluating European investment projects. It could be the EIB.” The finance minister also argued for discrimination between different kinds of spending when assessing whether countries were complying with the government borrowing limits mandated in the eurozone. There were “items of public expenditure that are probably not classified as investment, but are important”, he said. Italy’s 2015 budget offered an example: provision for welfare spending intended to ease the passage of the Renzi government’s controversial labour market reform. While this was not investment this did contribute to long-term growth. “I’d be very glad if this qualitative aspect were explicitly recognised in the evaluation of countries’ public finances,” said Padoan. He said he had not yet raised the issue formally in a meeting of the economic and financial affairs council (Ecofin). But he had spoken about it with colleagues, and discussed it with Jyrki Katainen, the commission vice-president responsible for the economy. Next to Padoan’s desk, in the vast office allocated to Italian finance ministers, there is a large crucifix and, below it, two trading screens. On one is displayed the indicator Italians know as the yield gap between Italy’s benchmark government bonds and Germany’s. It is a measure of the market’s confidence in Italy’s ability to pay off its vast public debt of more than 130% of GDP, and Padoan confessed that he monitored it constantly. Until last week, the screen beside his desk displayed an encouragingly steep drop from left to right. By 5 December, it was below 1.2 percentage points. But since then it has gained almost a fifth of a point as storm clouds have again gathered over the eurozone. Markets remain spooked by the prospect of an early general election in Greece and a victory for the country’s leftists, Syriza, whose leader Alexis Tsipras has mooted an orderly restructuring of his country’s debts. While disclaiming any desire to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, Padoan – a former IMF official – had a warning for him. “To think that it is possible to have an orderly restructuring of [public] debt is very dangerous,” he said. “It is a big mistake to think that there is [any such thing as] a controlled, calm restructuring.”
1811	1812	Gravity and other films that changed Hollywood for ever 	"very now and then a film comes along that totally changes everything: whether it is expensive new technology or a cute talking pig, nothing can be the same again. is the latest film that makes a whole swath of cinema look and feel redundant: its hard-won sense of documentary realism means everyone attempting to film a spacewalk or satellite explosion will have to raise their game massively. This is by no means a definitive, historical list – you would have to go back to the Lumière brothers for that – but we have narrowed it down to the seven films that have made the biggest impact on movies in their current form and obsessions. Superhero films were traditionally camp, trashy affairs – even , the first big-budget comic book film of the modern era played it mostly for yuks. Batman, of course, had been mercilessly satirised in the counterculture 60s via the pop art TV series starring Adam West, and comic book fans were used to being a subculture that was sneered at and looked down on. Batman's comic book writers – Frank Miller and Alan Moore among them – had left campness far behind, and Tim Burton picked up where they had left off. With his background in ghoulish animation and goth-lite comedy, Burton brought an intense, design-heavy brilliance to proceedings, overhauling the genre thoroughly and treading a careful line between high-voltage visuals and savage humour. With unparalleled merchandising opportunities alongside it, Batman took off, and Hollywood is still profiting from the consequences. Everything from X-Men to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy to Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot to Marvel's seemingly endless conveyor belt. Since the advent of the slasher film in the late 70s, horror films tended to be rigidly formulaic affairs – remorseless killers, screeching music, screaming teenagers. The Kevin Williamson-inspired wave of postmodern semi-spoofs in the mid-90s – , , – helped to loosen things up a little, but horror was locked into an aesthetic artifice that appeared unbreakable. Directors Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick, in trying to make a decent film to sell for cable TV, inadvertently triggered a wave of found-footage horror movies. Virtually abandoning their actors in the forest, they achieved an unprecedented level of snot-dribbling realism, which creeped out multiplex audiences to a staggering $140m (£87m). , , , . You want talking animals? Before Babe, that meant – basically – a cartoon. Or puppets. Your , your – they were either barking to command or supplied with voiceovers by standup comics. No one could take them seriously. director George Miller spent seven years developing an adaptation of Dick King-Smith's The Sheep-Pig. Using enormous numbers of animatronics, CGI lower-jaw movements and the like, Babe blew every previous animal movie out of the water: they were talking! All the time! Incredible. The seven Oscar nominations it got were a suitable recognition of its envelope-pushing status. the remake, , . In the old days, no one went to the cinema to watch a video – least of all chin-stroking art cinema types, who tended to prized Bessonian lushness and painterly Jarmanisms. But by the mid-90s the art house circuit was under siege from smart-alecks such as Tarantino on one side, and Hollywod FX behemoths on the other. Something had to give. Along came arch-prankster Lars von Trier – already a big noise after – and his acolytes, who came up with a ""movement"", Dogme 95, espousing stripped-down technology and unvarnished naturalism. Despite its built-in irony and over-before-it-began PR, Dogme 95 did one big thing: it made digital video a viable cinematic force. Festen, a knotty family melodrama that benefited from its home-video visuals, was the forerunner: a bona fide worldwide critical and commercial success, it overnight gave artistic credibility to what had hitherto been considered – technologically speaking – the preserve of poverty-stricken film students and pornographers. , , , Star Wars Episodes I and III, … and then everything. Lots of people made campaigning documentaries, but cinema didn't pay a great deal of attention. Countries with state-funded TV – like the UK – found a place for them there, but in the US especially docs tended to shrivel and die a lonely death without the sports/music/human-interest angle. Michael Moore bucked the trend, releasing first  (1989) and then (2002) to acclaim and some success, largely because of Moore's avuncular, engaging personality. But Fahrenheit 9/11, in which he basically blamed the Bush family for enabling Osama bin Laden's assault on America, put documentaries over the top. It may not have dislodged George W Bush from the presidency, but it attracted huge audiences (taking $119m (£74m) in the US alone), and lit a rocket under the entire documentary-making scene. , , , Spectacle was key, thought the film industry, under siege from a string of home-delivery formats from DVD to YouTube. The late 90s was the age of CGI-burnished extravaganzas – chief among them was James Cameron's – and the industry had been talking up 3D for some time, aware of the potential to charge more for a fancy format that couldn't be ripped off by the internet. But so far it had been largely confined to Imax documentaries, family-friendly animated films and the odd gimmicky genre piece. Anything bigger tended to have an opportunist conversion from 2D. Cameron had been working on Avatar for years, intended as a groundbreaking visual extravaganza with full CGI characters. By the time it finally hit cinemas in 2009, no one was all that impressed with CGI – but the 3D looked fantastic, and gave the whole format a massive shot in the arm. That it became the biggest grossing film of all time helped too; film-makers embraced 3D, and audiences did too. , , , . Cartoons, remember them? Sweet little fairy tales, or stories of funny jazz-dancing bears? Maybe a song or two to gladden the heart? Disney drove itself into the ground in the 70s and 80s, but had engineered a revival with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, but they weren't exactly new. Meanwhile, variants on the form – cheery stop motion (A Grand Day Out); sinister anime (Akira) – nibbled away at the edges. Realising the opportunities afforded by developments in computer imaging, (then owned by Steve Jobs, and largely developing systems for Disney), embarked on its own feature in 1990. Not only was Toy Story the first fully CGI animated film, it also pulled off a scripting miracle, nailing a near-perfect kidult tone that appealed equally to children and their parents. , , , … And one that didn't change the game but was supposed to. The early 80s were all about teenagers: horny, depressed, smart-mouthed, angry. Teens played video games, right? So a film about someone actually going inside a video game: that would be huge. Just like WarGames would be. Tron, with its cutting-edge CGI, Moebius-designed sets and undeniably exciting light-cycle races ought to have been huge. It did all right, but was nothing special. Jeff Bridges was a bit old for kids to identify with; the world was not yet as enthralled with computer culture as it was to become; and perhaps its conspiracy-theory plot was a tad ambitious. It came out, and then … nothing. Ten years later it seemed like we'd dreamed it. However, it had slowly accumulated cult status under the radar, and finally got a movie follow-up, Tron Legacy, almost 30 years later. , , ."
1818	1819	Why is China's stock market falling and how might it affect the global economy? 	China’s stock market has fallen sharply over recent weeks despite measures by officials in Beijing aimed at calming investors’ jitters and shoring up global confidence in the country’s slowing economy. Shares in China had soared 150% in the 12 months to mid-June as individual investors piled into the rising market, often borrowing heavily to do so. But chiming with and the signs of an economic slowdown, the momentum came to a shuddering halt when shares hit a seven-year peak. Following another plunge on what was dubbed “Black Monday”, China’s stock markets have now given up all their gains for the year. China’s , the yuan, this month only served to intensify worries about the world’s second-largest economy. Shares around the world . About £74bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped by a record of more than 1,000 points at one stage. such as crude oil and copper have also tumbled to multi-year lows as investors take fright over signs of waning demand in the world’s leading consumer of raw materials. The currencies of as investors drop those assets seen as riskier to hold. But investments perceived as safe havens in times of trouble, such as gold and some government bonds, are in demand. Some of the falls on stock markets are certainly reminiscent of the swings seen around the time of the collapse of the US bank Lehman Brothers. The FTSEurofirst 300, a pan-European share index, suffered its biggest one-day drop since late 2008, losing 5.4%. For Shanghai’s composite index, Monday’s 8.5% slump was the biggest since February 2007. But some economists say the parallels stop there. They see limited risk to China’s real economy from the stock market turmoil and little to be worried about beyond . Julian Jessop, the chief global economist at the consultancy Capital , said: “The current panic is essentially ‘made in China’. The recent data from other major economies, including the US, eurozone and Japan, has generally been good ... Aside from the bad news from China, there is very little to support fears of a major global downturn.” But others are less sanguine. They point out that China’s slowdown is just one of many factors worrying investors alongside lingering political problems in the eurozone, signs of weaker global growth and vast sums flowing out of fragile emerging markets such as Brazil. Furthermore, policymakers apparently have few tools left to help. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, suggests not and believes China’s stock market woes will not have much impact on European economies. But there are plenty of other voices saying this could get a lot worse. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, has suggested that the US Federal Reserve may be forced to ease monetary policy, rather than hiking interest rates in the next few months as had been expected. As in August 1997, 1998, 2007 and 2008 we could be in the early stage of a very serious situation. It is far from clear that the next Fed move will be a tightening. Furthermore, experts say policymakers do not have many tools available to shore up the global economy this time around. Interest rates are already at record lows and central banks have spent years printing electronic cash in quantitative easing (QE) programmes, cheap money that many blame for the latest market troubles. Stephen King, the HSBC economist, warned back in May: “The world economy is sailing across the ocean without any lifeboats to use in case of emergency.” Damian McBride, Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor, spelled out his advice for an impending crash on Twitter. Advice on the looming crash, No.1: get hard cash in a safe place now; don't assume banks & cashpoints will be open, or bank cards will work. Crash advice No.2: do you have enough bottled water, tinned goods & other essentials at home to live a month indoors? If not, get shopping. Crash advice No.3: agree a rally point with your loved ones in case transport and communication gets cut off; somewhere you can all head to. Another tweet posted later on Monday: Today is just the stock market catching up with the terror over defaults that's been gripping the bond market for months. Individuals with money invested in shares should not worry too much for now, financial market experts have said. Nick Dixon, an investment director at the asset management company Aegon UK, said: “If pension savers don’t need to access their fund for many years, they needn’t be alarmed by short term volatility. “Stock markets are in for a bumpy ride over the coming weeks, but if savers can stomach the ups and downs, equities are likely to provide superior returns over the medium and long term.” There had been widespread expectation that the US Federal Reserve would start the gradual process of . Signs of a potential hard landing for China could well stay the central bank’s hand. The same goes for the UK, where the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, recently hinted that a rate hike could happen . In China, meanwhile, the country’s central bank is widely expected to ease monetary policy further to shore up growth and confidence. A silver lining economists highlight for those countries that rely on imports of oil and other commodities is that this global sell-off will keep prices low. Oil has more than halved from a peak of $115 per barrel last summer to a Brent crude price of less than $44 per barrel now. At least some of that in lower fuel prices. Philippe Waechter, the global chief economist at Natixis Asset Management, said: “On the upside, the fall in the oil price will be positive news for European economies as consumer purchasing power will be increased.” Officials in Beijing are under pressure to step in with more measures to restore stability to China’s stock markets. The trouble they face is that every action is also perceived as a further sign of quite how worried they are about the slide in shares and the wider economy. Bill O’Neill, the head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said: “There will be some form of additional stimulus over the next few days and weeks. “That is likely to be combined with supportive words from developed economy central bankers aimed at offering reassurance that accommodative policies will remain in place regardless of when interest rates start to rise.” From Thursday, investors will be looking to the US and a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for signs of how this new bout of market volatility may influence their interest rate decisions.
1832	1833	Gravity remains a force, but The Counselor needs treatment 	"With a dip of just 14% from the previous weekend, easily resisted the challenge of a bunch of mid-level newcomers, retaining the box-office crown with £4.84m. After 11 days, Alfonso Cuarón's space-set drama has grossed an impressive £14.71m, with 3D contributing 90% of the tally. Although Gravity has a long way to go to match the year's very biggest live-action hits such as Les Misérables, Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel, the film is a dead cert to be the top grosser for a film not based on an existing property or established characters. Currently, the top live-action non-sequel that is not based on familiar elements is Django Unchained, with £15.7m, although some might argue that Quentin Tarantino's film inherited something from the original 1966 picture starring Franco Nero. Other strong original performers include with £14.7m and with £13.2m (unless you think the success of those films is in small part due to audience familiarity with the and ). In animation, where the brand value of the likes of Pixar and DreamWorks allows original stories to thrive more easily, top non-sequel performer is The Croods, with £26.6m. The weekend after Gravity and before the arrival of predictably witnessed a dearth of new blockbuster contenders. Top of the challengers is , with £815,000. Given the potent combination of director Ridley Scott, screenwriter Cormac McCarthy and stars Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt and Penélope Cruz, the result is a disappointment for Fox. On the other hand, with a Metacritic score of 49/100, the film was always going to have to overcome some stinging critical rebukes, including . Landing a place behind it with £794,000 but on fewer screens, with a higher site average and virtually certain to overtake The Counselor in the long run is , starring Forest Whitaker as the White House attendant who served seven US presidents. The result is a significant improvement on director Lee Daniels' previous film , which opened with £142,000 from 82 cinemas. The Butler is predictably behind the pace of its US performance – over there, the civil rights storyline and marketable elements, including co-star Oprah Winfrey, saw the picture debut with a robust $24.6m (£15.2m), on its way to a tally of $115m (£71.4m). Third-highest new entry is Hindi film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, a modern-day retelling of Romeo and Juliet, with £349,000 from just 85 screens, enough to deliver the second-highest screen average in the top 10, after Gravity. The numbers compare very favourably with the Julian Fellowes-adapted , starring Douglas Booth and Hailee Steinfeld, which opened last month with a poor £137,000 from 157 cinemas. Just outside the top 10 is , starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his writing-directing debut. With £343,000 from 262 sites, the numbers will be viewed as just about OK for an 18-certificate US indie film about a pornography addict. A place below it, , with £98,000 from 123 venues, and a £799 screen average, is hardly a great advertisement for the star power of Jude Law. Top British title in the box-office chart remains , falling a relatively modest 29% on its third weekend for a 17-day total of £7.30m. With this Judi Dench hit, weekend success is less important than midweek business, which continues to flourish impressively. Over the seven days, Philomena added a robust £2.54m and should soon overtake titles such as (£8.4m) and (£9.4m), both also aimed at older viewers. Not particularly setting any box-office records, but quietly thriving in its epic run at London's ICA cinema, must surely have achieved 2013's longest run at a single venue. The documentary opened there on 28 June and has played ever since – the coming weekend will be its 22nd consecutive week at the contemporary arts institute, where it has grossed £25,250 so far. Total UK box office on the title is £117,000. With the DVD arriving in stores next Monday, theatrical revenues may peter out at last. Although not included in the official chart by the data gatherer, the , starring David Tennant, proved to be one of the week's best box office performers. Beamed last Wednesday to 364 UK cinemas, the ""Live From Stratford-upon-Avon"" event achieved over 60,000 admissions, and a further 20,000 have booked for encore screenings of the play, delivering a total box office (including advance bookings) of £1.1m. For the eighth weekend in a row, box-office is running below 2012 levels, and on this occasion the shortfall is massive: down 51%.

1842	1843	David Cameron hears same old gripes from Beijing students as at home 	"Cameron Direct, the prime minister's meet-the-people roadshow, went global today as he launched his trademark question and answer session in Peking University, only to find the supposedly dragooned communist Chinese students were just the same as their British counterparts – angry about his plans to raise tuition fees and cynical over the lack of ideological distinction between UK political parties. In a hall emblazoned with the words ""Peking University welcomes his excellency the British Prime Minister"", the 300 or so students listened rapt as Cameron was introduced by the university chief as the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool and the man trying to reduce the size of the British state. Wandering the wooden stage, but with none of the shirtsleeved informality of the British events, Cameron tried a little Chinese saying ""Qi lai qi lai"", a passage from the national anthem, before responding to the embarrassed laughter by admitting he had a little more learning to do. He conceded that he never saw such a well-attended lecture hall when he went to Oxford, though he eschewed mention of any Bullingdon Club hangovers. Cameron said he wanted China's leaders to recognise that its economic power required that the country should take on its world responsibilities, including a greater commitment to human rights, and worldwide diplomatic activity concerning Africa and climate change. Big societal forces were at stake that were going to make Chinese society more open, he suggested. ""There is barely a global issue that needs resolution, which does not beg the questions: what does China think, and how can contribute to a solution?"" he said. It emerged that Cameron directly raised the cases of recent individual human rights abuses in a private conversation with Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, at a banquet on Tuesday. Sources said the case of the jailed Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo was raised. Cameron has, however, refused to make any public calls for the writer's release. Cameron told the students: ""We don't raise these issues to make to us look good, or to flaunt publicly that we have done so. We raise them because the British people expect us to, and because we have sincere and deeply held concerns."" The first questioner in the hall asked what Cameron could say about the relationship between the party and the country in Britain. Cameron Direct suddenly became Cameron Indirect as he cagily evaded the question. Another person praised the Tory leader for being ""so handsome and youthful"" before asking him whether deep ideological differences existed between the UK's parties. Drawing on his PPE degree, Cameron went into full Great Helmsman mode: the Conservatives believed in freedom, fairness and responsibility, he explained – and Labour believed in the state. But the gap between the parties ""was not that big"", he said, probably confirming the view of some students that political competition was an otiose western fetish. It was student rights that exercised the audience most as one questioner won applause demanding to know why Britain was increasing tuition fees, making it probably more difficult for Chinese students to go to a British university. Faced by this kind of pesky questioning from what could have been dissident Cleggite factions inside the Coalition People's party, Cameron moved to quash deviation from the party line. ""Raising tuition fees will do two things. It will make sure our universities are well funded and we won't go on increasing so fast the fees for overseas students. In the past we have been pushing up the fees on overseas students and using them as a way of keeping them down for domestic students. We have done the difficult thing. We have put up contributions for British students. Yes, foreign students will still pay a significant amount of money, but we should now be able to keep that growth under control."" The answer might have been deft political footwork in China but it will be no comfort for Britons to know that their children's tuition fees are being doubled partly to keep fees down for foreign students."
1843	1844	Student fees protest leaves ministers shaken but not shocked 	"Armed protection around senior ministers has been tightened in recent weeks after police warnings of a heightened threat of violence in the wake of the most far-reaching public spending cuts in a generation. Ministers expressed surprise this evening, therefore, that police had failed to maintain a high level of security around Conservative HQ on Millbank. ""This is not what we pay the Met commissioner to do,"" one senior Tory said. ""It looks like they put heavy security around Lib Dem HQ but completely forgot about our party HQ."" Ministers in both parties were shaken by some of the most violent scenes on the streets of London since the poll tax riots of 1990. The scenes were not exactly a surprise, however, as George Osborne put his party on notice late last year that it would enjoy a six-month window after the election, during which the full scale of the spending cuts would be outlined, before any backlash could begin against the spending cuts. David Cameron became prime minister six months ago tomorrow. One government source said: ""This is just the beginning. This is the first of a series of protests by various sections of society against what we are doing. The problem is this sets the benchmark for other protests. We've got the union demos coming down the line. They are dominated by the left."" One Tory minister said the government is braced for more protests but will survive the backlash against the cuts because the chancellor is working to a five-year plan. Osborne, who is cutting spending by £81bn as part of his strategy to eliminate the structural deficit by 2015, hopes that economic growth will be picking up by the election planned for that year. ""This is exactly what we were expecting,"" the minister said of the protests. ""We are working to a five-year plan, a five-year parliament. It is going to be like this for the first few years. There will be pain but there will be gain at the end."" There were greater nerves among who fear that the protests show they will be vulnerable when the cuts kick in. Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, today mocked Nick Clegg over his U-turn on university tuition fees shortly before the student protest turned violent. ""You are at Freshers' week,"" Harman said. ""You meet up with a dodgy bloke and you do things that you regret. Is not the truth of it that the deputy prime minister has been led astray by the Tories?"" The Labour deputy leader said of Clegg's decision to sign a pledge by the National Union of to oppose rises in tuition fees: ""During the election [he] hawked himself around university campuses pledging to vote against tuition fees. By the time Freshers' week was over, he had broken his promise. Every single Liberal Democrat MP signed the pledge not to put up tuition fees; every single one of them is about to break that promise."" Clegg replied: ""Let us remember the Labour party's record: against tuition fees in 1997, but introduced them a few months later; against top-up fees in the manifesto in 2001, then introduced top-up fees."" He continued: ""Then Labour set up the Browne review, which it is now trashing, and nowthe Labour party has a policy to tax graduates that half the frontbench team does not even believe in. Maybe she will go out to the students who are protesting outside now and explain what on earth her policy is."" But Tim Farron, the Lib Dem MP who is standing for election as the party president, underlined deep unease at the U-turn: ""Whilst I think this package has been improved a lot the sticking point for me is simply this: I made a pledge to the people who voted for me that I wouldn't vote for a rise in tuition fees and that's why even with the improvements in the package I won't vote for it,"" he told BBC News."
1844	1845	Bank of England committee voted 7-2 to keep interest rates steady 	 policymakers remained split over whether to raise interest rates immediately, with two members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) voting in favour this month. revealed that dissenters Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty voted for a 0.25 percentage-point rise to 0.75% for a third successive month. The remaining seven members, however, including the Bank governor, Mark Carney, voted to leave rates unchanged at 0.5%, where they have been since March 2009, at the height of the financial crisis. For the majority of the committee, , weak pay growth, signs that the recovery was losing momentum, and increased risks to the UK economy posed by the eurozone justified leaving rates on hold. They argued: “A premature tightening in monetary policy might leave the economy vulnerable to shocks, with the scope for any stimulus that subsequently became necessary being limited by the effective lower bound on Bank rate.” Weale and McCafferty, however, argued that the MPC should look past low inflation, just as it had previously looked past high inflation pushed up by external price pressures. They argued that though growth in the eurozone had been “disappointing”, the UK had not been affected by damaging financial contagion. They also believed that wage growth might rise sharply as unemployment continues to fall. “In the judgment of these members, even after a rise of 25 basis points in Bank rate, monetary policy would remain extremely supportive, and an early rise would facilitate the committee’s aspiration that any subsequent rises in Bank rate should be only gradual,” the minutes revealed. Despite their arguments, financial markets have pushed their expectations of a first rate rise to the third quarter of 2015, from earlier expectations of a rise in spring. Economists said the arguments put forward by the majority of the MPC would remain relevant in the coming months, leaving Weale and McCafferty increasingly isolated. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital , said: “With the eurozone’s malaise unlikely to right itself quickly and inflation set to ease further over the coming months, it is hard to see what will trigger the MPC to raise interest rates over the next few months. “Accordingly, while we maintain our view that Bank rate is likely to rise to only 1% by the end of next year, we now think that May, rather than February, is the most likely date for the first hike.”
1859	1860	Steven Soderbergh: Hollywood rejected Liberace film for being 'too gay' 	"Hollywood studios refused to finance Steven Soderbergh's forthcoming HBO biopic of the flamboyant entertainer because it was ""too gay"", the Oscar-winning film-maker has revealed. Despite the presence of two fellow Academy Award-winners, Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, in the leading roles, executives repeatedly passed on putting up the movie's relatively meagre $5m budget. Titled Behind the Candelabra, Soderbergh's film centres on the relationship between Liberace and his , who met when the latter was just 17. The film will screen on the pay-TV channel HBO in the US following Hollywood's lack of interest. ""Nobody would make it. We went to everybody in town,"" . ""We needed $5m. Nobody would do it. They said it was too gay. Everybody. This was after Brokeback Mountain, by the way. Which is not as funny as this movie. I was stunned. It made no sense to any of us."" The Ocean's Eleven director denied being disappointed by the lack of a theatrical release for his film, which is based on Thorson's book Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace. ""[HBO are] great and they're really good at what they do, and ultimately I think more people will see it, and that's all you care about,"" Soderbergh said. ""Studios were going: 'We don't know how to sell it.' They were scared."" The film-maker said reaction from executives to Behind the Candelabra differed markedly to that received by his low-budget, sex-themed drama The Girlfriend Experience, which successfully achieved a theatrical release despite the . Soderbergh's film, which will screen in the spring, is intended to be his final movie before entering self-imposed retirement. It stars Douglas as Liberace, who spent more than 50 years performing and lived a highly colourful life prior to his death in 1987 from an Aids-related illness. Damon plays Thorson, who famously sued his former lover for $113m in palimony in 1982, claiming he had been the pianist and singer's companion for five years. Soderbergh also has the thriller – starring Channing Tatum, Rooney Mara and Jude Law – due for release in US cinemas in February (March in the UK)."
1863	1864	Golden Globes 2014: don't be duped by American Hustle 	"The are often seen as a cheerfully rackety outfit given colossal importance simply by preceding the Oscars, but they are also an institution that, in specifically honouring comedies, favours that lighter kind of movie which can be overlooked in the general solemnity of awards season. So maybe it is appropriate that the madcap black crime comedy American Hustle has emerged as the big winner of the Globes with its three awards: for best comedy or musical, and best actress and best supporting actress (comedy or musical) for Amy Adams and the all-conquering Jennifer Lawrence. The much anticipated landslide for Steve McQueen's powerful slavery drama did not materialise, although it gained a single and respectfully prominent win as best film (drama). This was really a very ""open"" awards evening. The Globes are always the most watchable sort of television entertainment (far superior to the Oscars because of the more intimate setting, and the recent excellent hosting by Amy Poehler and Tina Fey), but they don't necessarily give any real clue as to how the academy awards are going to go, other than, surely, to shorten the odds still further on 12 Years A Slave getting the best film prize - and perhaps nothing else. Maybe that extraordinary film will be cordoned off into that one big prize while slighter pieces of work will be garlanded elsewhere? There is no doubt that has hustled its way into the limelight in this season, riding a self-created wave of hipness, an irresistible comedy riff of a film. Martin Scorsese was not nominated as director for his crazily energised decadence epic The Wolf Of Wall Street, but perhaps he should have been. His star Leonardo DiCaprio took the prize for best actor in the comedy category, as the crooked broker Jordan Belfort. This was a picture comparable to Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas, which was also so clearly a model for American Hustle. At 71 years old, the director's vigour and influence are absolutely undiminished. The space thriller Gravity — recently hailed as a British technical success at the Bafta nominations — has earned its director Alfonso Cuarón the directing prize, a category which, perhaps bafflingly, is not divided into ""comedy"" and ""drama"", and so Cuaron was able to beat McQueen, Alexander Payne, Paul Greengrass and , a result which many will find a surprise. Gravity was a huge, old-fashioned spectacle of a film, a terrific experience, superb in its simplicity and Barnumesque flair for movie showmanship, but it has been dismissed in some quarters (rather condescendingly) because of the alleged hokiness of its dialogue and characterisation. Well, perhaps these are broad. But it is all part of the brash and brilliant melodrama. For my money, and specifically in terms of direction and shaping actors' performances, Alexander Payne was arguably the winner, but Gravity was still a formidable achievement. It gave the evening's hosts the night's best gag, noting that George Clooney would rather float away into space rather than spend one more minute with a woman his own age. The worthiest and most satisfying acting award was to Cate Blanchett for her performance as an impossibly haughty, damaged and heartbreakingly ruined socialite, Jasmine, in Woody Allen's excellent Blue Jasmine, a film which really deserved to get Allen a direction or screenwriting nomination but didn't. Blanchett brilliantly showed how Jasmine is in denial about what has happened to her, and how she herself has helped to bring about her own downfall. It is an overtly and unfashionably theatrical performance in many ways, a performance you might expect to see on stage, with mannerisms and vocal tics designed to reach the back row of a hushed and expectant theatre auditorium. It will be interesting to see if this success carries forward any further from here. The two acting prizes for Jean-Marc Vallée's Dallas Buyers Club will be a heads-up for British cinema audiences — this heartfelt drama has not yet had its UK release. Matthew McConaughey has the best actor (drama) prize in the real-life story of Ron Woodroof, the straight man with AIDS in the 1980s who pioneered the search for alternative therapies and treatments when a bureaucratic and often openly homophobic political establishment dragged its heels. Jared Leto wins the supporting actor prize for playing the gay man he befriended and made a comrade in his battle. It's a role which required McConaughey to lose an awful lot of weight, which is something that does always impress awards electorates — and he was still markedly gaunt for his cameo in Scorsese's The Wolf Of Wall Street as the cynical trader who mentors DiCaprio's still uncorrupted broker in the ways of un-righteousness. It's an awards-bait film in many ways, with an easily digestible ""issue"" and reassuringly heterosexual lead character in a heartfelt and approachable drama. Again, however, I have to say Chiwetel Ejiofor was the more deserving winner in that category, and Jared Leto was not obviously better in his own category than contenders including Michael Fassbender and Barkhad Abdi who was excellent as the terrified pirate in Paul Greengrass's Captain Phillips. But Leto's win is a sentimental pleasure to those of us who remember his teen debut in the 1990s TV cult classic My So-Called Life. So movies like August: Osage County, Philomena and Saving Mr Banks may conceivably be fading, while Gravity, 12 Years and American Hustle pull ahead. But there is still no clear dominant contender. There is still a chance that a movie like Alexander Payne's poignant Nebraska, with its wonderful lead performances from Bruce Dern and June Squibb will break through at the Oscars."
1872	1873	Bafta whistleblower says voters reward big-budget movies they have never seen 	"It is widely considered one of the world's most important film awards ceremonies, one that sits behind only the Oscars and the Golden Globes in terms of public notoriety. But a whistleblower has told the Daily Mail that the winners and nominees for the annual Bafta awards are often chosen by judges who have not even seen the movies they are voting for. The anonymous writer of a also charges that high-profile films with big marketing budgets are far more likely to be rewarded than smaller independent movies, because voters cannot possibly find the time to see all the films they are expected to choose from. ""As a Bafta voter for many years I can reveal that the voting process is based less on artistic merit than on a combination of coercion, trend-following and pot luck,"" the writer suggests. ""Let's be clear. Bafta voting guidelines state explicitly that you must only vote for films you have seen. Which makes perfect sense. But I've done it. And I bet everyone else has, too. You vote for the ones you think are going to win. ""We're sheep. And we follow the sheep in front of us. The days are still ticking by, and you still have all these films to watch, and you've been meaning to get to them but you can't, and there are all these obvious front-runners … ""And so you do it. You vote for a film you haven't seen. It's why the same old names appear year after year."" The writer also cites ""screenings and Q&A sessions with cast and crew"" as a conduit for the successful march towards Bafta victory for those films with the required marketing budget. ""Gone are the days of the lavish dinners and all-expenses-paid jollies — but you are certainly looked after,"" they write. ""A Mayfair hotel. A complimentary glass of champagne. Not an inducement, of course. But we hope you enjoyed the film. ""These events are expensive to put on. So already the field of competitors is being narrowed down to the Hollywood studios with their big marketing budgets. They will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars."" The anonymous writer also suggests that the celebrity of certain actors makes them far more likely to pick up awards. ""Judi Dench could blow her nose and she'd get nominated (she famously won a Bafta for her eight minutes of screen time as Elizabeth I in Shakespeare In Love)"", they write. ""Emma Thompson, check. Tom Hanks, check. Kate Winslet, hmm, she wasn't in a movie this year, can I vote for her anyway? Are these really the crowning performances of their careers? No, but they'll get nominated anyway."" A spokesperson for Bafta told the Guardian: ""BAFTA provides every opportunity for members to see films throughout the year with screenings arranged by both BAFTA and distributors, free cinema access across the UK, DVD screeners, and online viewing, and members are explicitly instructed to vote only for films they have seen and only where they feel qualified to cast an informed vote in that category."" They added: ""We work hard to create a level playing field for the entered films, and a process that is rigorous, open and fair, with ."" These rules dictate that in the first round, voters ""should abstain in any category where they feel unqualified to vote or where they have not seen a considerable number of films"". This suggestion is strengthened for second round voting, where the rules state: ""Voters must abstain in a category if they have not seen all of the nominated films in that category, or their knowledge of advancements in that craft is not up-to-date."" More than 6,500 members of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts – mostly experienced, jobbing professionals from the industry – decide the winners of the each year. The Alfonso Cuaron sci-fi drama Gravity is leading the charge for this year's awards with 11 nods, following the announcement of the 2014 nominations on Wednesday. Steve McQueen's slavery epic 12 Years a Slave and David O Russell's heist comedy drama American Hustle have 10 nods apiece, while Paul Greengrass's piracy drama Captain Phillips has nine."
1877	1878	Peter Greenaway to receive Bafta for outstanding British contribution to cinema 	" is to receive the outstanding British contribution to cinema award at this Sunday's Bafta film awards. The director of The Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning by Numbers and The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover will be honoured for more than three decades of film-making. He made his debut in 1980 with The Falls, a post-apocalyptic mock-documentary in 92 short sections. Greenaway, who is known for his collaborations with the composer Michael Nyman, said: ""Given the always complex effort involved, to be permitted in the first place to make films with so many collaborators always astonishes me, and to be permitted the licence to do so with such freedom to continually experiment even more so. Everyone agrees that cinema is changing its characteristics very fast, and to be awarded a Bafta for trying to contribute to that change is a pleasure and a delight, an encouragement and an acknowledgment that the effort is valuable, certainly for myself and certainly for all those numerous collaborators who have assisted me in this effort over more than 30 years."" Nik Powell, chairman of Bafta's film committee, said: ""Peter Greenaway is an iconic British film-maker who has worked with many of our most accomplished actors, including Michael Gambon, Tim Roth, Ewan McGregor and the recipient of this year's Bafta fellowship, .

1878	1879	Hollywood studios told: don't call awards nominees 'winners' 	"The organisation that runs the has warned Hollywood studios not to overegg their awards-season credentials by referring to nominations as ""wins"", . As the Oscars hype machine steps up a gear to culminate in March's , adverts have begun to appear in trade magazines celebrating the achievements of contenders for this month's Golden Globes. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), which operates these , has said it will look unkindly on instances of movies being referred to as ""winners"" of nominations. ""We have recently seen several instances in which the word 'winner' was used too prominently in publicity and advertising to describe nominees,"" Theo Kingma, the HFPA president, warned in a letter to studios. ""While earning a nomination is certainly an honour and one to be celebrated, it is not a 'win' and using that term or terms similar to it is likely to mislead the public and diminish the excitement around the awards show, when the winners will be revealed."" Publicity for a number of prominent contenders has recently used a format in which the word ""winner"" appears in large text above the number of Golden Globe nominations received by the film. Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, the Meryl Streep drama August: Osage County, Stephen Frears's Philomena and Justin Chadwick's Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom have all been named as transgressors by the Hollywood Reporter, though there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by any of the studios involved. The HFPA has not previously targeted the practice, which was banned by the Oscars body, the , several years ago. The move is being seen as the latest endeavour by the HFPA to improve its image after years of criticism over lists of nominees that seemed geared towards attracting high-profile Hollywood stars to its annual ceremony.

1883	1884	Dallas Buyers Club: Toronto 2013 - first look review 	" day in the life of the rodeo cowboy. A slug of bourbon, a dance with the bull, a post-buck shuffle with a prostitute under the stands. A life of narrow parameters. Pleasure taken fast, hard and simple. shows how terminal illness ripped up the routine of one such small thinker. Ron Woodroof was a homophobic hedonist who, in 1986, was given 30 days to live after being diagnosed HIV positive. His world flipped from gay-bashing in the bar with his blue collar buddies, to hours in hospital, camped next to fellow AIDs patients, most of whom were gay men dealing with a disease that had started to devastate their community. Woodroof's response to his diagnosis was to reject his doctor's prescription, head for the Mexican black market to collect his own cocktail of alternative therapies, then set up a subscription service to shop the treatment back to the same people he claimed to hate. He was a grizzly, complex character. Dallas Buyers Club is at its best when it keeps him that way. lost 38 pounds to play Woodroof. He delivers a twitchy, hostile performance on par with anything he's done since he escaped the rom com cul-de-sac. He's matched by Jared Leto as Rayon, a transsexual drug addict who goes into business with Woodroof and carries the responsibility of broadening the shit-kicking cowboy's world view. Rayon paints Woodroof's motel room a garish red (""It's Cranberry Mocha!""), sticks pictures of Marc Bolan up amongst the cutouts from girlie mags. The odd couple came together because there was money to be made, but Rayon reasons it won't hurt to dripfeed Woodroof some tolerance as well. Less juicy is Jennifer Garner's role as the more sympathetic of Woodroof's doctors. ""You're always in a white coat,"" he says. ""Are you afraid of colour?"". The screenplay answered in the affirmative a long time ago. America's AIDS crisis has been under a small scale cinematic re-evaluation of late. Last year's Oscar-nominated documentary How to Survive a Plague condemned government inaction. Dallas Buyers Club takes on big pharma, waging war on the bureaucrats who were happy to charge $10,000 a year for drugs that were toxic, while the FDA stood in the way of treatments that were proven to work, but less marketable. It's in this fight that the film loses part of its thrust. The suits and their profit margins are no match for McConaughey as Woodroof. The wildcard's more fun to watch. Dallas Buyers Club takes its own alternative route compared to the prescribed biopic conventions. There's a conversion for Woodroof, but it's not dramatic or revelatory. He didn't have enough time left to become a true reformer. He accepts and even loves Rayon, but we don't get a grand-scale happy-clappy realisation that all of us are equal. Nor should we. This is not about a community taking care of its own. This is about Ron Woodroof looking out for himself, permitting difference to that end, then growing gradually out of routine homophobia. He was a grizzled bastard who spun a profit that paved a way for change. A survivor who escaped himself through desperation and greed. Dallas Buyers Club stays true to that remarkable, redoubtable spirit."
1884	1885	The Wind Rises – Venice 2013: first look review 	"ayao Miyazaki, the master craftsman of hand-drawn animation, comes bumping into Venice with The Wind Rises, a gorgeous yet ultimately frustrating tribute to the Japanese airplane designer Jiro Horikoshi. Here is a film with a clean outline and a foggy centre. I wanted to love it, tried to love it and then went down in flames. It turns out that it is not always possible to view the beauty in isolation. Sometimes you need to take a long, hard look at the outside world and then perhaps connect the two. The Wind Rises tells the story of a peaceful man in the service of ruinous ends. It is a film about pure artistry and impure results. Jiro Horikoshi is the myopic, wide-eyed genius who winds up assisting the rearmament of Germany and goes on to create the phenomenal Mitsubishi Zero fighter jets for the Japanese military. ""Who are they going to fight?"" he says idly, as though he's asking about the weather forecast. Jiro, it seems, has no particular interest in promoting the war or preventing the war. He is more concerned with the health of his sickly fiancee; more focused on the wonderful nuts and bolts business of designing his planes. ""The dream of aviation is cursed,"" a ghostly mentor tells him at one stage. ""But what would you choose – a world with pyramids or one without?"" Jiro's Zero fighters were later built at slave labour camps and were used for kamikaze missions, although the film does not mention this. Jiro, for his part, is painted as an innocent, incurious man who perhaps feels that his responsibilities end when his planes are complete. All of which would be fine – a great springboard for a drama about art and its consequences – were it not for the fact that Miyazaki is so incurious too. The film-maker so clearly admires his subject that he never truly stoops to question his vision or hold his man to account. Naturally the animation is a joy to behold. The film's crisp colours and commanding lines summon up a ravishing portrait of pre-war Japan with its puffing steam-trains, huddled neighbourhoods and lulling nocturnal tram-rides through town. Some of the setpieces (most notably the apocalyptic earthquake that leads to the burning of Tokyo) are the equal of anything the director has produced in or . But the film itself is genteel to a fault. It's too polite, it needs more bite. It lets enigmatic Horikoshi off the hook, bobbing out to the clouds, forever out of reach."

There have been significant changes to the format of the awards ceremony for 2014. Taking place at the Tobacco Dock in London and hosted for a sixth year by comedian and broadcaster Dara O Briain, the event will allow public entry for the first time in its history. The evening will be proceeded by Indie Games, a showcase of nominated titles from Sony, Namco and Sega. Portal developer Valve will be present with a “secret shop” selling merchandise, but probably not announcing Half-Life 3. Bafta has more information at .
1894	1895	Steve McQueen defends 12 Years a Slave over 'torture porn' criticisms 	" has insisted his Oscar-tipped race drama 12 Years a Slave is no more violent than the average movie. McQueen, whose third film is leading the awards season charge after picking up and , said he had been determined to maintain historical accuracy when depicting the slavery experience. Based on a true story, 12 Years a Slave stars Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup, a New Yorker sold into slavery on the plantations of Louisiana in 1841 after being kidnapped in Washington DC. ""Either we're telling a story about slavery or we're not. And I wanted to tell a story about slavery,"" . ""But, I think, it's not as violent as most films you'll see at the weekend in the cinema, far from it."" McQueen's comments follow heavy media coverage of an alleged spat with prominent New York film critic Armond White, who was reported to have heckled the director at the New York Film Critics Circle awards on Monday. White, who fiercely denies any verbal attack on McQueen whatsoever, for its scenes of violence against slaves on deep south plantations during the 19th-century antebellum era. The director added that he welcomed awards season success for his film, which is in UK cinemas today. ""Awards are important as it's a pat on the back, so to be given that encouragement is always welcome as far as I'm concerned,"" he said, adding: ""It's a very strong year for film. It's one of those times that I'm grateful that people are actually making bold statements with cinema."" Ejiofor admitted he felt weighed down by the challenge of properly depicting the horrors of slavery, a subject matter which has not been heavily covered by Hollywood. ""I felt, initially, after reading the script, quite intimidated by it,"" he told Yahoo. ""I felt the weight of responsibility of it."" Meanwhile, the BBC has revealed it will partner with McQueen on an epic TV drama about the lives of black Britons between the late 1960s and the present day. drama controller Ben Stephenson told the Press Association: ""It is too early to announce the details, but it is incredibly exciting to be working with the hugely talented British director who has rapidly become one of the finest directors in the world."" This article was amended on Monday 13 January 2014. We attributed a quote in the article above to the director Steve McQueen, when the speaker was 12 Years a Slave star . This has been corrected."
1906	1907	Oscars 2013: what it's like to win 	"Phew. That's better, now I've got a cup of tea in my hand. Famous? It's only a documentary, for Christ's sake. But yes … it was amazing. It is such a surreal experience. We documentary makers don't get to mix with real Hollywood, but it had got very good distribution in the States so a lot of people knew about it. I met a lot of properly famous people. I had Joan Collins fondling my Oscar. I wished Daniel Day-Lewis luck before he went on – a great win that, he is a class act. I'd been there before, when I won for Man on Wire, so I knew the drill a little bit – but I'm not sure if that really helps much. For the first time this year, thanks to the changes introduced by Michael Moore, all the members of the academy got to vote on it, 6,000 people who all got DVDs instead of just the documentary sector of about 170. So it was a much more level playing field, and it felt like a good year to win. I thought the Oscar might go to The Gatekeepers, which is a really great film, and I would have been quite content to have been beaten by that. But it was fantastic to win. I have several new projects on the go, and one in production, and it helps so much when you go to the money men if they have some faint idea who you are. You're only as good as your last hit, and the Oscar casts a long shadow: it really helps. Before I met him, the director, Malik Bendjelloul, whose first film it is, had been working away by himself with absolutely no money, begging and borrowing. He shot some of the film on his iPhone. I met the guy from iPhone and he was really chuffed to hear that, so I said: ""When are we all getting our new phones?"" and he said: ""Just give me a call."" So that's good. It's all about the swag in the end. [Singer Sixto Rodriguez, the subject of the documentary] doesn't really communicate by phone or email, so I haven't spoken with him directly, but I have heard from his daughter Sandra, and apparently he's thrilled. Today I'm going to tackle an absolute volcano of emails that has erupted. Tomorrow I'm going on holiday in the Caribbean with my family. A proper holiday. I may even turn my phone and email off.  Searching for Sugar Man is out on DVD now"
1907	1908	Wolf of Wall Street continues to rake in the profits ahead of its Oscar rivals 	"A week ago, contenders for the best picture Oscar , and stood more or less neck and neck with around £11m apiece. Now the Scorsese comedy has pulled ahead with just shy of £15m, compared with £13.69m for Slave and £12.2m for Hustle. The Wolf of Wall Street is already the ninth-biggest 18-certificate movie at the UK box-office, behind (£21.6m), (£21.3m), (£19.5m), (£17.1m), (£15.8m), (£15.7m), (£15.5m) and (£15.4m). Wolf will very soon overtake the last four films on that list, and has a good shot at £20m lifetime. The Bruno figure includes some box-office for the 15-certificate version. Including Monday takings, Wolf is now at £15.17m. With a 34% fall from the previous weekend, Wolf is demonstrating marginally better traction than Slave (down 36%), which benefited from a 13% expansion of screens. In contrast, Hustle is now shedding cinemas, and fell a heftier 43% in revenue. Speaking to the Times Magazine, Samuel L Jackson recently made wide-ranging comments about 12 Years a Slave, including one about its middling commercial performance: ""Was the story worth telling? Yeah. Financially? The last count here was moderately OK."" That assessment is more pertinent to the actor's home country, where it has taken $45.8m (£28.14m) to date – less than half of both Wolf of Wall Street and American Hustle. In contrast, Slave has played genuinely broadly in the UK, as director Steve McQueen acknowledged when accepting the Best Film prize at the on Sunday: ""I have people in the street – builders, bus drivers – being so supportive to the movie. I've felt so much love for this film in this country and I'm so humbled and heartwarmed that it's from my own country."" Reading on mobile? For the first time since mid-November, no new release managed £1m at the UK box-office. Top of the heap proved to be dating comedy , starring Zac Efron. Local distributor eOne faced a tricky positioning challenge, since the film unfolds from the perspective of three male characters – which pushes it towards or – but Efron is an actor more likely to appeal to a female audience, and his romance with character is the central storyline. Marketed as a ribald date movie with appeal to both genders, the film was maybe aiming for the crowd that embraced the Britcom last February. An opening of £961,000 resulted, although this was boosted by Wednesday/Thursday previews of £184,000 – strip those out, and the weekend tally goes down to £777,000. Having already flopped the previous weekend in the US, and toplined by second-tier star Aaron Eckhart never looked likely to perform well here. A debut of £811,000 may come as mild relief for local distributor Entertainment Films, although once again this figure was boosted by previews, without which the weekend tally dips to £648,000. Down in sixth place, the Mark Wahlberg-starring Afghanistan war picture , in fact did better than I, Frankenstein on a like-for-like comparison, since its £752,000 haul was achieved without previews. The number is not so far behind the three-day tally for That Awkward Moment, albeit on more screens (see Top 10 below). Not included in the official weekend report since it occurred last Thursday, the was the real winner of the past week. The single showing on that date – as opposed to the typical 12 a regular film receives over the course of a three-day weekend play period – earned box-office takings of £754,000. With the odd repeat showing over subsequent days, the tally rises to £796,000, enough for fifth place in the weekend chart. Coriolanus stars Tom Hiddleston, and the sold-out run concludes on 13 February. The play was broadcast to cinemas in conjunction with National Theatre Live. So far the 2014 awards race has produced few casualties, with even – which has failed to engage the attention of Oscar and BAFTA voters – powering its way to £4.65m to date. But stumbled when it arrived in cinemas last December, and the film's significant nominations at the Oscars – including the key categories of best picture, director, original screenplay, actor and supporting actress – have arrived too late to help. Now – originally positioned as an awards contender – is the second of this year's crop to falter, with a weak debut of £191,000 from 211 screens, including Wednesday/Thursday previews of £36,000. The film is from director Scott Cooper, whose previous picture won two Oscars in 2010, and stars Christian Bale, who is nominated this time for American Hustle. The February half-term holiday looms, and Warner Bros's The Lego Movie, officially arriving February 14, will be the one to beat. The film is playing paid previews this weekend, where it will doubtless pose a significant challenge to Friday's new arrival Mr Peabody & Sherman, the latest from DreamWorks Animation which is based on the 1960s US TV cartoon. There is far less awareness of the characters in the UK and Ireland though, so this could be a tough one for international distribution partner Fox. Also likely to pick up a half-term audience, perhaps surprisingly, is the remake, since its 12A certificate makes it available to younger teens or children of any age when accompanied by an adult. The original Paul Verhoeven film was a certificate 18. Chasing slightly more niche audiences are , starring Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild award winners Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, and Ralph Fiennes's second outing as a director, – in which he stars opposite Felicity Jones as Charles Dickens. , £2,385,585 from 515 sites.

1909	1910	The Wolf of Wall Street attracts new complaints from disability groups 	"Martin Scorsese's financial-era-excess movie The Wolf of Wall Street – this time from disability-advocate organisations who have protested at its use of the ""R"" word and its suggestion of drug-induced ""cerebral palsy"" type behaviour. Peter Berns, CEO of disability group the Arc and Stephen Bennett, president and CEO of United Cerebral Palsy, issued a joint statement saying: ""The Wolf of Wall Street is getting a lot of attention for how it offends audiences on many levels, but one aspect that hasn't been discussed is its use of the R-word and its unacceptable mockery of people with cerebral palsy. Hollywood just doesn't seem to get it."" Berns and Bennett are referring to in The Wolf of Wall Street, as well as a third scene where Leonardo DiCaprio's Jordan Belfort is describing his drug experience as reaching the ""cerebral palsy phase"". The statement continues: ""Among moviegoers who have paid to see The Wolf of Wall Street in recent weeks are people with disabilities, their parents, siblings and friends. It's time for Hollywood to wake up and see that their customers deserve better."" The film-makers have not yet specifically addressed this complaint, but The Wolf of Wall Street as ""a cautionary tale"", with Leonardo DiCaprio saying: ""I hope people understand we're not condoning this behaviour, that we're indicting it … if you sit through the end of the film, you'll realise what we're saying about these people and this world."" This followed a stream of complaints against the film, accusing it of , resulting in at a special screening for Academy award voters."
1914	1915	The peculiar charm of Benedict Cumberbatch 	"n 25 July 2010, two unrelated events took place in the space of 60 minutes that would change 's life for ever. At 9pm that evening, the BBC broadcast episode one of . At 10pm, the Guardian, the and published the first instalment of the Afghan war logs, courtesy of . Cumberbatch wasn't aware of the second event that night, because by then his name was trending on Twitter and his phone was going berserk. The actor was watching himself soar from respectable levels of critical acclaim into the stratosphere; Afghan war logs were the last thing on his mind. He'd never even heard of WikiLeaks or , and wouldn't discover what they would hold for him personally until more than two years later when his agent rang while he was at a friend's birthday party. ""I remember it really clearly,"" he says. ""I had to go into the stairwell to try to get better reception. I heard them say, 'These people are really interested in offering you this part playing Julian Assange.' There was a TV series idea kicking around at the time, and I thought that was it, so I said, 'Great, I didn't realise that series was going ahead.' They said, 'No, it's .' ' are doing a film about Julian Assange!?' 'Yeah, and they want you to do it.'"" By then Cumberbatch was on the sort of roll every actor dreams of. Before Sherlock, he'd been a slightly odd-looking character actor accustomed, he liked to joke, to ""big parts in small films, and small parts in big films"", having played , and , as well as supporting roles in and . His modern-day Sherlock Holmes, however, was a revelation: cold-eyed, impatient, fast-talking, like a human iPad with a hint of Asperger's thrown in. declared it the greatest on-screen Holmes ever. Since that first series, watched by nearly 10 million in Britain alone, Cumberbatch had starred in , Into Darkness and , won an Olivier for his performances in , and . But playing Assange is his biggest role yet. In January, he flew out to Iceland to begin filming. The man he was to play had by then been under police guard in the Ecuadorian embassy for more than six months, and had ignored all requests by the actor to meet. The very day before shooting began, just as he was having the final tests for his wig and makeup, Cumberbatch received a 10-page email urging him not to make the film. It was from Assange. ""It was a very considered, thorough, charming and intelligent account of why he thought it was morally wrong for me to be part of something he thought was going to be damaging in real terms, not just to perceptions but to the reality of the outcome for himself. He characterised himself as a political refugee, and with awaiting trial, and other supporters of WikiLeaks who have been detained or might be awaiting detention, and the organisation itself – all of that being under threat if I took part in this film."" Did he wobble? ""Of course. The fact that it was coming from the man himself, the day before we started filming? Of course I would hear and feel the protests of the man I was about to pretend to be. I'm a human being."" Had Assange persuaded him to pull out, Cumberbatch would not now be looking at a likely Oscar nomination. I watched the film directly before our interview, and his portrayal is so convincing that at the end I felt a moment of genuine confusion and thought I was about to meet Assange himself. In real life, Cumberbatch looks nothing like the WikiLeaks founder. He is also unlike any actor I've come across. We first met last summer, when he had just finished making Star Trek in Hollywood, and was brimming with the bouncy charm common to men enjoying a sudden inflation in their sexual currency. The vertiginous cheekbones, snub nose and slanted green eyes have had him famously , but Sherlock had transformed him into a pin-up, and he cheerfully admitted to making the most of it. When we meet again at the Toronto film festival, where has just premiered, he is surrounded by a circus of publicists, people with clipboards, stylists and whatnot, but the easy, unguarded friendliness has somehow survived. He is not the only successful actor to hold on to his good nature in the face of fame, but most are less interesting than the characters they play. You get an idea of why Cumberbatch isn't from his description of what he wrote in response to Assange's email: ""I don't want to go into any great detail, but it took me four hours and the central thrust was: this is not documentary, this is not a legally admissible piece of evidence in a court of law, it's not going to alter perception in a way that is actually politically going to damage you at all. People who will come to see this film will be savvy enough to see it as what it is; it's a starting point, that should both provoke and entertain. It will be a talking point, but your life, your private life, your persona, is fatefully intertwined with your mission – it cannot not be now. And to be honest, I think the sort of general perspective on you is still echoing from the kind of character assassinations that began way back when, with the initial leaks, and that is now heightened by the accusations of sexual misconduct in Sweden, and so you're known as this white-haired Australian weirdo wanted for rape in Sweden who's holed up behind Harrods in some embassy. So the misinformation about you is already there. ""I said listen, this film is going to explore what you achieved, what brought you to the world's attention, in a way that I think is nothing but positive. I admit to doing work because I'm a vain actor. I want to be able to say, yeah, I'm playing a lead in a film. That's a huge career move for me. Yet I'm not acting in a moral vacuum. I have considered this, and whatever happens, I want to give as much complexity and understanding of you as I can."" If I were Assange, I'd almost certainly have thought, well, he would say that, wouldn't he? But the intellectual engagement must have been unmistakable and, though Assange may not have believed him, Cumberbatch was telling the truth. The film begins in 2008, and follows the founder's ascent from underground hacktivist to international terrorist, in the eyes of Washington, or swashbuckling cyberhero to his admirers. It focuses on the intensely complex and ultimately soured friendship between Assange and his righthand man, a German hacker called Daniel Domscheit-Berg, as well as his wary and ultimately fractured relationship with the Guardian. But it ends before the allegations of rape in Sweden saw him arrested, jailed and held under house arrest for a year, and before his flight to asylum and indefinite captivity in Ecuador's London embassy. , and there are moments in the film when it's hard to believe it isn't him on screen. Cumberbatch's performance doesn't so much evoke as inhabit his character, and the accuracy of the voice, physicality and mannerisms is uncanny. He captures Assange's extraordinary capacity to charm and beguile, to intoxicate and manipulate, while offering glimpses of his isolation. When Cumberbatch first read the script, he worried that it cast Assange as some kind of cartoon baddie. ""I think I may get my head bitten off by Disney for saying so, but everyone agreed with that."" He immersed himself in research, reading endlessly and interviewing people who knew Assange, and gradually the script evolved into a more nuanced portrayal. His performance draws heavily on his research into Assange's childhood. ""I know it's a Freudian cliche to go, 'Oh well, when I was a kid…', but, to be honest, it's so profoundly true with Julian. To have been a child in a single-mother relationship, being pursued around the country by an abusive stepfather who was part of a cult – to be taken out of any context where he could discover who he was in relation to other people – well, to then become a teenage hacktivist, and evolve into a cyber-journalist, to me makes perfect sense. And he's still a runaway today. I find that profoundly moving. ""He kept isolating himself. Every bridge he built, he burnt. And I understood why at times, because he is on a trajectory that's different from other people. And, because of that, he can't form those human relationships that other organisations have. And that is tragic."" Those who know Assange have often speculated that he might be on the autistic spectrum. Cumberbatch says he has no idea if that is true, but seems to suspect not. ""The bridge-burning thing could just be circumstantial nurturing from what happened to him as a kid. How do you build trust when that's constantly been taken away from you?"" He doesn't buy the theory that he's just a vain egotist, either. ""Because you can counter that with, no, he's basically putting himself out on a limb for something he believes in, a rigid ideology, and that's uncompromising. That behaviour seems to be solipsistic, but that's because of what he's holding on to."" It's an ideology Cumberbatch subscribes to only up to a point. He opposed the war in Iraq, and marched with a million others against it in 2003. ""And it was such an amazing day. Though kind of dominated,"" and he starts to giggle, ""by the protester with the placard saying 'The Only Bush I Trust Is My Own', which always makes me laugh. But that was the only thing that does make me laugh, thinking back to that day. There was just the despondency of realising that it meant nothing."" When he read the WikiLeaks reports in the Guardian in 2010, about what western troops were up to, he'd been horrified. ""Death squads and civilian casualties and underarmed soldiers and strategic mishaps and the brutalisation of soldiers and the terrorising of civilians: the worst fears we had about that war just came flooding through, and I thought it was extraordinary."" But before Assange and his followers get too excited, Cumberbatch turns out to be decidedly ambivalent about what WikiLeaks and other cyber-whistleblowers such as are up to. He is alarmed by the revelations of mass surveillance by the and , and doesn't like the idea of anyone reading his private emails – ""It's none of your business"" – but then adds, ""Oh, but you might have stopped me from being killed on a tube I took last Wednesday. If they are saving lives, how can we say that's less important than civil liberties? You don't have any civil liberties if you're dead. Isn't it hypocritical to say, we should know everything about you as a government, but the government can't know anything about us?"" Assange argues for total transparency for powerful institutions, and total privacy for individuals. ""But if you are a private individual who's packing semtex to kill people and destroy what we know as democracy for political purposes, then you're more than just a private individual."" As for Bradley, now Chelsea, Manning, the young US army officer who leaked hundreds of thousands of war logs, diplomatic cables and other US state secrets to Assange and has just been sentenced to 35 years, Cumberbatch is sympathetic on a human level. ""But he broke a law. He knew what he was doing."" Manning has applied for a presidential pardon, but Cumberbatch can't see why Obama should grant it. ""He did what he did out of a conviction that an alarm bell needed to be sounded. But his superiors might have been right to say to him, it's not your position to be worried about it within the hierarchy of the military organisation, which is why he had to be sentenced. He took an oath, and he broke that oath."" This sounds to me like the former public schoolboy in Cumberbatch speaking, though I hesitate to say so, because he is so weary of the peculiarly British critique that he is too posh to deserve success. His parents are both jobbing British actors, (Minder, Bergerac) and (Only Fools And Horses), who scraped together just enough money to send their only son to Harrow, in the misguided hope that it would launch him into a more dependable career than acting. He had great fun at Harrow, but headed straight from there to drama school in Manchester, and is now stuck with a toff tag that the tabloids have made much of. When I ask him to name the most maddening misconception about him, he mutters, ""I think the Daily Mail Online has covered just about every one of them."" The celebrity press are also having lots of fun with his bachelor status, managing to publish a new photograph and rumour practically every week featuring a new ""mystery beauty"". For 12 years his girlfriend was the actor , whom he met at drama school, and who played the Tory spin doctor Emma Messinger in . The relationship ended in 2011, and Cumberbatch always gets quite cross at the suggestion that he dumped her after hitting the big time with Sherlock. He has often talked about wanting to become a father, but at 37 there is no sign of that yet. Actually, it's entirely possible that he hasn't talked about anything of the sort. Cumberbatch has reached that level of fame where even the most throwaway remark is parsed for hidden meaning and rebroadcast to the world as a statement of the utmost importance. A recent one was a report that he had a crush on and was desperate for an introduction. ""I have to explain this whole thing about Matt Damon,"" he laughs. ""I'm a big fan of his, I think he's great. I mention this in a phone interview, and the woman down the other end of the line goes,"" and he adopts a silly, high-pitched American accent, ""'Really? Do you really like him? Really? Why?' I was like, ' Well, um, because he's a really talented actor, he's done lots of great things in his life, I think he's great. It'd be great to meet him.' 'You wanna him?' 'Er, well, yeah, I mean, of course it would be great to meet him and hang out.' 'Well, we could facilitate it!' 'Oh, OK. Great. Do pass on that I'm a huge fan. It would be great to see him.'"" He pauses to roll his eyes. ""Next day: 'Benedict Cumberband's Bromance With Matt Damon!' You know,"" he laughs, ""it's all that shit."" Does it drive him mad? ""Well, sometimes. But mostly amused, really. You can't get too tied up with it."" He doesn't think he's an infinitely better actor now than he was before Sherlock, when he didn't have to deal with this sort of crazed attention. ""No, I think I've just been asked to do more. And the more you do, the more people trust that you can do."" But it's a nuisance that's unlikely to go away soon: this year he'll appear in two more big films, and , and he has also recently finished filming series three of Sherlock. ""I felt very sentimental on the last day of shooting, thinking, 'Oh, I've got to say goodbye to him again.' He's fucking hard work, always has been, but I love him, and I got sad that I wasn't going to see him again for a while."" He won't reveal much about the new series, beyond a coy, ""Well, there's a reunion that doesn't necessarily go to plan. And there's a bonding experience that throws Sherlock and Watson back together in a very firm way. And there's a new union as well, in the shape of a marriage, which takes part in, so we see that."" Before he heads off to rejoin rehearsals for another film, , in which he plays another real-life character, , I begin to ask one last question, but he's guessed it before I finish. Does he ever think, I say, that right at this very moment… ""He's still there? Yeah. I think about that a lot."" Assange remains a fugitive in the Ecuadorian embassy, and Cumberbatch has often walked right by the window, wondering if he will ever get out. ""How is it going to play out? I don't know. It's conceivable that he'll still be there in 20 years' time, isn't it?"" The Fifth Estate is released in the UK on 11 October. An updated version of WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War On Secrecy can be preordered for £5.99 (RRP £7.99) at The subheading on this article was amended on 16 September 2013 because it did not adequately reflect a nuanced interview."
1916	1917	12 Years a Slave fails to represent black resistance to enslavement 	"The legendary African-American historian John Hope Franklin used to say that black resistance in stories of enslavement tended to be erased in favour of the narratives of domination and degradation. Yet scholars tell us that while there was often acquiescence under the inhumane conditions of American slavery, there was also always resistance. Take Harriet Tubman, who was born into slavery but deliberately escaped – and went on to help many more people to freedom. ""There are two things I've got a right to and these are death or liberty … one or the other I mean to have,"" Tubman said. ""No one will ever take me back alive; I shall fight for my liberty."" But this resistence is almost entirely missing from Steve McQueen's film , which opens in the UK today. While the 1854 memoir by Solomon Northup, on which the film is based, describes several stories of attempted escapes and fighting back on the part of the enslaved, none of these appear in the film. It does show Northup's emotional resistance to his enslavement and there is one scene where he fights back against the man to whom he was mortgaged, but nobody else in the film seems to be allowed that. The film remains true to Northup's decision to stay on the plantation until he was ""legally"" able to free himself, but ignores the many people who consistently did whatever it took to escape enslavement: ""Notwithstanding the certainty of being captured, the woods and swamps are, nevertheless, continually filled with runaways,"" the memoir tells us (Solomon Northup, 12 Years a Slave, 1854). It seems that once the first attempt to construct a shipboard insurrection by three enslaved men does not succeed, the film is not able to present any other real forms of escape. Once Northup is on the plantation, the possibility of escaping is absent. Because Northup had lived as a freeman – though in a New York state where freedom was layered – he had a conception of freedom that many enslaved often had to imagine. He knew what was available and constantly remembered his wife and children and a life beyond enslavement. But it is a sad conundrum of the film that it is his individual memories of ""freedom"" (in a context in which slavery had not yet been abolished) which drives the narrative. Perhaps the most directly significant resistance text which, again, does not find its way into the film is one in which Northup himself describes the ""Great Pine woods"" as a place of respite from slavery and as a site of possible more extended escape. His description (in the book) of how he ended up revealing the hiding place of some of these runaways is telling, for he describes a scene one night on the way home after a shopping errand when he was accosted by a few runaways who simply wanted food: ""no evil design upon me, except to frighten me out of my pig"". In the end they were caught because of his report. Northup indicates that not a day passed without him contemplating escape. References to the Great Pine woods are a constant symbolic evocation of the possibilities for living elsewhere than on the plantation. The journey between that ""free"" space and the plantation marks the boundaries between being free and being enslaved. Northup chooses the plantation, and in the end attempts to secure his freedom the ""legal"" way in a context where the illegality of slavery itself was in question. But in focusing so much on the plantation, the film misses the Great Pine woods, as free space symbolically and literally. Thus in the end we see Northup getting his freedom ostensibly through the beneficence of a few white people who supported him, and then actually attempting to go through the courts when black people still were not able to testify against whites. Another critically important resistance story which is in the memoir but not in the film is conveyed through the black woman slave named Celeste, who lives for months in the woods. According to Northup's memoir, ""it was not unusual for slave women as well as slave men to endeavour to escape"". Perhaps it provides more dramatic cinematography to present instead, the slave woman Patsy's request that he kill her to liberate her from slavery. Instead of the stories of Celeste, or Nelly, who escaped, we have Patsy as the victim of horrendous abuse. Patsy is seen with her back flayed and her skin lacerated in a horrible scene depicting the degradation of the black female body. Northup may leave the plantation in the end, but there is no chance of any positive outcome for her. Rather the gratuitous display of the black woman's raped and flayed body is chosen to represent the horror of slavery. The film's overwhelming graphic presentation of these scenes - minus the other resistance stories - presents largely complicit black women, singing and picking cotton or cowering in fear. Also, the nuances of racialisation which the memoir captures in Eliza and her daughter are not presented. Eliza is shown as largely a moaning woman, even though she is the one who confronts Northup about his own complicity in the system. Importantly, in the book Elliza's daughter could pass for white and Eliza is obviously bi-racial. In the movie the entire family is dark skinned, though the daughter is a bit lighter. This removes another layer of meaning – that some enslaved peoples seemed close in appearance physically to whites. These nuances of racialisation seem to totally escape the film. Thus the seller's decision to keep the young girl is significant as she was the young ""near white"" type put into sexual slavery in the famous balls of New Orleans. That some slaves looked as ""white"" as their masters is a critical feature of this narrative, and remains critical in contemporary American race relations with its ""one-drop"" rule that assigns minority status to mixed-race individuals. Including this subtlety would have made the film much more educational, which McQueen says was one of his intentions. Of course there is no requirement for absolute fidelity between a written text and the film version, but the informed viewer still has the responsibility to at least critique any notable textual absences. So while there is much to applaud in McQueen's work, it fails to challenge the standard trope in films about slavery: a cathartic display of the intense violence and degradation of enslavement of the black body - and once again ignores the resistance text of black histories."
1919	1920	Christoph Waltz set for 'nemesis' role in next Bond movie 	Two-time Oscar winner will star opposite Daniel Craig in the 24th James Bond movie, of the Daily Mail. Bamigboye, who has a strong track record when it comes to the Bond series, revealed the casting yesterday via Twitter. In he reports the Austrian actor will play Bond’s nemesis, but also suggests the role is not an out-and-out villain. “It’s not immediately evident whether the part’s friend, or foe, or a bit of both,” according to a production source. Bamigboye also said on Twitter that the new film would shoot early next month on location in Mexico, Morocco, Austria, Italy and London. As previously reported, director Sam Mendes is to return following the $1bn success of 2012 outing Skyfall, which saw in his third outing as the suave British secret agent. that 12 Years a Slave’s Chiwetel Ejiofor was being sought to play the next James Bond villain, casting which now appears unlikely. However, it was previously confirmed that Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris are due to return as the new M, Q and Moneypenny respectively. Bamigboye that Léa Seydoux, the French star of Cannes smash Blue Is the Warmest Colour, has also been added to the cast of Bond 24. Rory Kinnear will reprise his role as MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner from Skyfall and Quantum of Solace.
1920	1921	Christoph Waltz tipped to play Blofeld in new James Bond movie 	Christoph Waltz will play the iconic James Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the 24th 007 film, . The two-time Oscar-winner is expected to be named as Daniel Craig’s latest opponent next month. suggested Waltz would initially portray a conflicted role – neither “friend” nor “foe” – in the new Bond movie. However the Mail, which initially reported the Waltz casting scoop, now suggests the Austrian actor is set to play Blofeld for the first time on the big screen in more than three decades. The Bond movies have been free to incorporate classic elements of the 007 mythos such as Blofeld and nefarious organisation SPECTRE once again after a long-running legal case with the estate of Blofeld co-creator Kevin McClory was settled in November last year. McClory’s family sold its remaining stake in 007 to Danjaq, maker of the Bond films via its better known subsidiary Eon, and distributor MGM. The move allowed for rights to characters introduced in 1965’s Thunderball, a collaboration between Ian Fleming and McClory, to be used in future instalments. Ernst Stavro Blofeld is perhaps the best known, and certainly the most ubiquitous Bond villain, variously portrayed on the big screen by Donald Pleasence, Charles Gray, Telly Savalas and Max von Sydow, as well as inspiring the character of Dr Evil in Mike Myers’ Austin Powers films. He was last seen played by Max von Sydow in 1983’s Never Say Never Again. The Mail suggests Waltz will be introduced via subterfuge as a character called Franz Oberhauser, “son of the late Hans Oberhauser, a ski instructor who acted as a father figure to Bond”. However, he will later be revealed as Blofeld. Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris are due to return as the new M, Q and Moneypenny respectively in Bond 24. There have also been reports that Léa Seydoux, the French star of Cannes smash Blue Is the Warmest Colour, has been added to the cast. Rory Kinnear will reprise his role as MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner from Skyfall and . This article was amended on 24 November 2014. The original article incorrectly stated that Blofeld was last seen on the big screen in 1981’s For Your Eyes Only.
1927	1928	The Fifth Estate: Toronto 2013 - first look review 	For an employee of the Guardian, particularly one with jetlag, Bill Condon's WikiLeaks thriller can seem more hallucination than movie. An account of the ascent of and his collaboration with this newspaper (among others) in the publication of classified documents, it plays like one of those dreams in which your office looks normal enough from the outside, but step within and everything's subtly different. It's more Scandinavian, somehow; with car park pillars and glass walls to which people attach crucial bits of paper, as on Crimewatch. The editor has developed a sudden taste for shagpile rugs. And why did you never notice the deputy is a dead spit for the dishy one on Downton Abbey? Such tweaks will not get an artistic licence revoked. In fact, in adapting both a book on the affair by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding, as well as tech activist Daniel Domscheit-Berg's account of working for Assange, is a project in whose sources one can place considerable faith. Certainly, Condon does. At times it can feel he's risked coherence for chronology, giving us his own surfeit of data without offering sufficient kit with which we can sift it. The plot tracks Assange from the time he recruited Domscheit-Berg, through early online celebrity, before his meeting with Guardian investigative reporter Nick Davies ( ), who, in consultation with editor Alan Rusbridger ( ) and deputy Ian Katz (Dan Stevens), began working with Assange towards a coordinated launch of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and war reports. The timeline bumps a bit, but still pushes forward confidently, with our hacker heroes forever arriving in a new city, before some fresh turn of events requires them to slam shut their laptops and rush off again. The template is David Fincher's , which took the creation of Facebook and turned it into the character study of a neurotic loner with the world at his fingertips. Both films go big with the swishy visuals, this one deploying a bombardment of text and newsreel to suggest the morass of info, plus flight map-style graphics illustrating its flood across the globe. Both films are eager to show that computing is an arena for creative genius, with much clacking on laptops like Steinways. Both also suffer from the problem that watching someone type isn't, after a while, that exciting. Condon further ups the dramatic ante with Lynchian visualisations of Domscheit-Berg's inner life, plus a lot of techno. And both films choose as their key arc the relationship between men most closely associated with the site's inception. But while The Social Network kept the focus on the anti-hero, relegating Eduardo Saverin's role to support, this one bumps up the best friend to a lead, overestimating our interest in Domscheit-Berg's lovelife. Not that the film is really that interested either. At heart, The Fifth Estate is a good, old-fashioned bromance – Assange even gets to meet the parents (spoiler: it doesn't go well). As for Cumberbatch, he's both the asset and the slight undoing; so magnetic as to render hopes of a two-hander redundant. It's a virtuoso impersonation, from the deep drawl to louche geek twitches. Suited, he could pass for Nick Cave after a night or two in the fridge. Mostly, though, this Assange is as extraterrestrial as Cumberbatch's Khan in last year's , a lip-smacking vampire typing through the night. From a distance, he looks like a lizardy angel, courageously saving the world; close up he squints and snuffles like a bleached, greasy mouse. Introducing the film last night, Condon said he wanted to explore the limits of truth-telling: when was a lie too important not to expose, and when was it so crucial you must not dream of doing so? In that, he has succeeded admirably: this is highly competent catnip for the watercooler crowd. Toronto has prepared itself well for the forthcoming week with a hot potato. Now roll on the cheese.
1950	1951	Kathryn Bigelow makes history as first woman to win best director Oscar 	" today became the first woman in history to win the best director award at the Oscars. Her low-budget Iraq war film, The Hurt Locker, about a bomb disposal team, was the big winner at the ceremony. It took six academy awards, including those for best picture and best original screenplay. The Hurt Locker triumphed the over the 3D blockbuster Avatar, directed by Bigelow's former husband, . Cameron, who sat behind Bigelow at the ceremony in the Kodak theatre in Hollywood, was one of the first to offer congratulations when he reached over to tap her on the shoulder. Bigelow described the award as a ""moment of a lifetime"" and dedicated her Oscar to the servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""May they come home safe,"" she said. The Hurt Locker is an apolitical film focusing on the heroism of bomb disposal experts. It was critically acclaimed but not a box office success and was . Bigelow was only the fourth woman to be nominated for best director in the 82-year history of the . The previous female nominees were Sofia Coppola for Lost in Translation in 2003, Jane Campion for The Piano in 1993, and Lina Wertmuller for Seven Beauties in 1975. Barbra Streisand, the director of films including Yentl and The Prince of Tides, presented the award. In interviews after the ceremony, Bigelow resisted reporters' attempts to encourage her to gloat about her victory over Cameron. ""I think he is an extraordinary film-maker,"" she said. Much of the , who married in 1989 and divorced two years later. It was the subject of jokes from the hosts of the ceremony, Steve Martin and . ""She was so pleased to be nominated with him she sent him a beautiful gift basket – with a timer,"" Baldwin said. Bigelow has for decades been a female pioneer in the male-dominated world of action movies. Her previous films include Point Break, Strange Days and K-19: The Widowmaker. she told the Guardian in video interview last year. At the Directors Guild of America Awards, where she also won the top honour, Bigelow said: ""I suppose I like to think of myself as a film-maker"", rather than as a female film-maker."
1961	1962	Emma Thompson makes acclaimed New York debut in Sweeney Todd 	" has made her New York stage debut to critical acclaim but it will be over in a flash – there will be only five performances of her playing London's worst piemaker . After a gap of nearly 25 years since she last took to the stage, Thompson is starring alongside Bryn Terfel in a concert production of Stephen Sondheim's at the Avery Fisher Hall. She plays Mrs Lovett and when she began the run on Wednesday she was following in some impressive footsteps. Angela Lansbury won a Tony after originating the role in 1979 and the character has been played in the West End by Sheila Hancock, Julia McKenzie and in 2012, Imelda Staunton. So how did she do? Writing for the Guardian, Kayla Epstein said Thompson ""not only held her own against more experienced vocalists, but wound up running off with the show. Yes, her voice was inconsistent; it was silky one moment and brassy the next, and at a couple points it even broke, but it had power."" ""Is there anything Emma Thompson cannot do?"" adding that she sings surprisingly well. ""She quips, she does pratfalls, she swipes props from members of the New York Philharmonic – including, at one point, conductor Alan Gilbert's baton. In short, she nearly steals the show out from under her very talented (and admittedly stronger-voiced) co-stars."" The to the role adding: ""Thompson showed off a robust singing voice and plenty of comic chops."" The : ""Her Mrs Lovett is a comedic gem. And it turns out Thompson can sing, especially Sondheim, with the best of them. ""At last night's performance she was so playful that she even grabbed a real mink piece off the neck of a female audience member, and wore it for some time through the show."" The audience included Meryl Streep, Sondheim veterans Barbara Cook and Bernadette Peters and the composer himself who was cajoled on to the stage for the standing ovation. Thompson was last on stage in London in 1989, in a production of John Osborne's Look Back in Anger with her then husband . She proved her musical credentials when she starred with Robert Lindsay in the wildly successful revival of Me and My Girl in 1985. Since then she has concentrated far more on film and TV work, winning a best actress Oscar for Howards End in 1993 and a writing Oscar for her adaptation of Sense and Sensibility. Some thought she should have been nominated this year for her portrayal of Mary Poppins creator PL Travers in Saving Mr Banks. : ""I was really shocked. And I wrote her a long, heartfelt email saying how bad I felt. And she wrote me back and said, 'Good.'"" Streep said how much she was looking forward to New York Philharmonic production. Before it she told the New York Times the role was ""a fantastic combination of rage and wit ... humour. That's a killer combination which you don't get very often."""
1962	1963	Net contributions: how the internet has influenced the English language 	" believe it to be the trend that is going to have the greatest impact on the English language in the 21st century,"" linguist David Crystal once wrote of the internet, and certainly it has proved to be an area of rich lexical change. The meanings of well-known words (bookmark, surf, spam, web) have shifted dramatically, while our vocabularies have expanded to accommodate new ones. The lower-case is in ascendance, @ has flourished, the full stop has been reinterpreted as the ""dot"" and entire trends have been refreshed by the prefix ""cyber"". Here are some of my favourite internet contributions to the language: An accumulation of people you found on the internet. Used to fill space and waste time, often spotted on social networking sites.

1963	1964	Emma Thompson: the A-lister who sets her own rules 	"t was only a matter of time until the BBC broadcast images of Emma Thompson's downstairs lavatory. The combination of her larky sense of humour and love of a theatrical flourish made it somehow inevitable. And so last month it came to pass. The actress, having been overlooked for an Oscar nomination, was televised at her home receiving a ""Mark""; a golden statuette in the likeness of the 's film critic, which was offered in recognition of her screen portrayal of the author of , Pamela Travers. She was, Kermode said, "" , never allowing the author to descend into crotchety caricature, constantly suggesting a strain of melancholia behind the biting, control-freaky haughtiness"". Her impeccable comic timing, he said, meant she should have received the industry's highest accolade and not his own gilded approximation. Thompson, 54, said she was thrilled and placed his award on top of her porcelain cistern, between the Oscars she received for 1992's and for her screenplay of 1995's . Thompson's script for this acclaimed Austen adaption had been a shyly guarded private passion for several years and she has since spoken of the courage she had to summon before showing it to her former Cambridge Footlights friends, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. Now, finally, this spring has seen the fruition of an equally cherished long-term writing project – a plan to bring to the screen. Following a long battle for funding and a legal dispute, Thompson's film, starring her husband, Greg Wise, alongside Dakota Fanning, has finally been screened privately at the Barbican in London and is set to be released in the spring. Once out in cinemas, should help crown another career peak for one of Britain's most successful filmstars, following on the heels of her rave reviews for this month's in New York. ""Is there anything Emma Thompson cannot do?"" asked of her performance as Mrs Lovett in the New York Philharmonic production of Stephen Sondheim's musical. ""She quips, she does pratfalls, she swipes props from members of the New York Philharmonic – including, at one point, conductor Alan Gilbert's baton. In short, she nearly steals the show out from under her very talented (and admittedly stronger-voiced) co-stars."" And next month, in London, the curtain will go up on a new ballet version of , her popular children's film. Created with the help of dancers from the Royal Ballet by the it will mark the 20th year of the company and run at the Peacock theatre. Thompson, that great lover of undercutting quips who kicked off her high-heeled Louboutins in January to accept her Golden Globe barefoot and who stayed with her producer friend Lindsay Doran for the 1996 Oscars rather than accepting the five-star hotel suite she was offered, is also paradoxically one of our most extravagant actresses and stars. At once at home with celebrity and glamour, she is always at pains to emphasise her love of living the basic life with her close family in her Scottish bolthole. She has spoken publicly too, , of the hectoring voices inside her head that have sometimes threatened to take her to the edge of despair. They urge her, she said, to ""try harder; must do better"". She was born in April 1959 to the Scottish actress Phyllida Law and Eric Thompson, the witty and charismatic creator of the British version of . Early in her career, this paternal fact was regularly rolled out as an oddity because it seemed incongruous when she was appearing in cameo comic roles in or in the television rock drama with Robbie Coltrane. These days, it seems quite a neat fit. She, like him, is drawn to entertain children. Not only did she give permission for the London Children's Ballet to turn her hit franchise into a show, but she was also the chosen author of a sequel to Beatrix Potter's . The publishers persuaded her, she said, by sending a pleading letter penned by the eponymous rabbit. Thompson also has a bracing, nanny-like demeanour, which has been put to use not just in the role of her own but last year as the creator of Mary Poppins, the most famous nanny of them all, opposite Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. She is drawn to classic Disney and gave Angela Lansbury, the vintage star of , a part as a villain in . Lansbury told the last year that the role had helped her cope with widowhood. ""Nanny McPhee pulled me out of the abyss. I love Emma. She has an enormous heart,"" she said. Thompson met Fry and Laurie reading English at Cambridge and Fry has recalled: ""There was no doubt that Emma was going the distance. Our nickname for her was Emma Talented."" It is easy to imagine their social circle resembled the high-jinx of the 1992 film, , directed by Thompson's first husband, Kenneth Branagh, but surely it can't have been that cosy? Her first big break came with the lead role in Fry's revival of the musical , in which she appeared for 15 months, leading her to exclaim later: ""I thought if I did the fucking Lambeth Walk one more time I was going to fucking throw up."" Her younger sister, Sophie, has also developed a strong stage and screen career in Britain, earning plaudits in 2012 for her comic turn as Mrs Hardcastle in a National Theatre production of Sophie is, like her big sister and mother, determinedly unstarry in the English mode, but a tad more convincing, since the other two have a commanding presence they cannot always step away from. It is a domineering nature that Emma has recently owned up to in an interview and even cited as a cause of the breakdown of her marriage to Branagh. ""I'm a bit bossy,"" she said, ""and I have to say some people find it quite difficult to deal with. Mentioning no names, but my first husband."" After a period being widely feted as ""Ken'n'Em"", the break-up left her bereft, with only her hopes for and her eventual closeness to her future second husband to keep her going. ""Work saved me and Greg saved me. He picked up the pieces and put them together again,"" she has said. The couple have a daughter, Gaia, and a son, Tindyebwa. In a recent appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres talkshow in America, Thompson's friend Meryl Streep gave an account of an apology she had offered to Thompson. Her own Oscar nomination in the best actress category for was a surprise, she said, and may have pushed out the British actress. ""I was really shocked. And I wrote her a long, heartfelt email saying how bad I felt. And she wrote me back and said, 'Good.'"" Thompson understandably has an acute sense that opportunities to shine may be few and far between. Accepting her award from Kermode, she said the part of Travers in had been ""a great role"" and added that, at her age, ""not many of those come along"". Thompson went on to offer a little jokey self-analysis, suggesting the grumpy role of a writer who was ""horrible to everyone"" was a terrific release for such a well-brought up Hampstead girl. ""I am almost psychotically nice to people,"" she confessed, ""which actually conceals a deep and dark desire to be unpleasant."" Whether the broad smile and game attitude of one Britain's leading filmstars really hide some misanthropic impulses we may never know, but it's certainly true she is driven. Evidence of this persistence is evident in her dogged commitment to her new film, . The film has almost come to grief as ignominiously as Ruskin's marriage did on the night he is said to have rejected his wife for not being designed to excite desire, ie having pubic hair. The film wrapped two years ago, but a Cannes premiere and some festival screenings had to be cancelled when separate lawsuits were brought by two screenwriters who claimed that Thompson had plagiarised their work. A final appeal will be heard in New York on 10 April, after which may be released. Filmed in Venice, Scotland and London, : ""We have tried to stick to what Effie wrote about the incident,"" he said, ""but you never really know if Ruskin had set her up for it in some way. She had to go to the ecclesiastical court to get a divorce, so if nothing else you have to admire the strength of character of this girl."" If strength of character is something he particularly admires, he has picked the right wife."
1964	1965	From the first email to the first YouTube video: a definitive internet history 	"In late 1971 Ray Tomlinson, an engineer working on a time-sharing system called Tenex, combined two programs named Cpynet and SNDMSG in order to send the first ever network email. It had been possible to send email from one user to another on a single computer for nearly 10 years but Tomlinson was the first to use the primitive Arpanet to send text from one computer to another. While the same principles are used to send emails across the world today, the very first email (the contents of which Tomlinson says he has long forgotten) was sent between two computers sitting right next to each other. At the same time, Tomlinson also devised the format of modern emails, with the @ symbol dividing the user name from the name of the host computer (although he did not invent the symbol itsel). And why did he do it? ""Mostly because it seemed like a neat idea."" Computer viruses and worms, essentially just self-replicating programs, were predicted as early as 1949 by the mathematician John von Neumann. It is generally accepted that the first was a virus called the Creeper, which infected Arpanet in 1971. It was created by an engineer called Bob Thomas working for BBN, the same company that employed email creator Ray Tomlinson. The Creeper was not, however, malicious. Infected machines would simply display the message, ""I'm the creeper: catch me if you can,"" but did not suffer any lasting damage. The first piece of anti-virus software was created as a direct response to the Creeper's challenge. The Reaper was also a self-replicating program, which spread through the system in much the same way that the Creeper had, and removed the offending virus from infected computers. Just as quickly as it had spread, the Creeper was caught. In 1981, while working for the , Dr Larry Brilliant created a primitive online conferencing system. Its original purpose was to organise the rescue of a helicopter downed on a humanitarian mission in Nepal. On his return to America, Brilliant showed his system to Apple founder and, on his advice, launched a modified version of the software that would run on people's home computers. The next step was to develop a permanent text conferencing system – what we now know as an internet forum. The first example, known as , began with a meeting between Brilliant and Stewart Brand, then editor of the , an early green-living manual. Brilliant pitched Brand an idea: he would use a version of the software to create a discussion forum for the items in the catalogue. ""But Stewart had the good sense to ignore my idea and instead he just opened it up for discussions of any kind,"" Brilliant recalls. ""It was the best discussion – of the meaning of life, sexual practices, travel advice, love, law; everything you find on the internet today except the commercialism."" Brilliant adds: ""About 99.9% of what made the well great was Stewart's ideas of what could be talked about and his uncanny ability to bring online the smartest people of the day – senators, governors, campaigners and a whole lot of writers."" Professor Scott E Fahlman worked at the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon in the early 1980s, at a time when it was making heavy use of online bulletin boards. Often someone would make a sarcastic remark and a few readers would fail to get the joke. At one point a humorous about a brainteaser involving mercury was interpreted as a safety warning, nearly causing the building to be evacuated. The group began devising some form of punctuation to mark posts that weren't to be taken seriously. It was Fahlman who suggested :-). ""I was probably not the first person ever to type these three letters in sequence, perhaps even with the meaning of 'I'm just kidding' and perhaps even online,"" Fahlman concedes. ""But I do believe that my 1982 suggestion was the one that finally took hold and spread around the world."" Multiplayer games were developed inside the internet's first decade, paving the way for games such as Second Life that define much of internet culture today. (which stands for Multi-User Dungeon) was the first text-based fantasy game, developed by programmers Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at Essex University in 1978, allowing players all over the world to interact. Arriving in ""the Land"" at a cottage next to a cemetery, new visitors could figure out the extent of their abilities, then explore, kill things and score points, with the ultimate goal of reaching the wizards' level. Bartle admits that they weren't trying to be pioneering: ""We didn't know we were the first, we didn't know that there weren't hundreds of these games. It was the best way I could articulate what I wanted to say about the real world – by creating another world."" While studying for his master's degree at Montreal's McGill University in 1989, Alan Emtage, a young computer scientist, was also working as a systems administrator for the university. But he found rooting around online to locate software for the students to be a bit boring, so set about streamlining the process. He developed a set of scripts which would run automatically every evening to build a single, easily searchable database. Once word got out that Emtage could find pretty much anything on the internet, inquiries flooded in. Two of his colleagues, Mike Parker and Bill Heelan, were brought in to rewrite the system with him, and this version was named . Emtage was suddenly at the heart of an online revolution. ""By 1991, that one machine in our office running Archie was using half the bandwidth of eastern Canada,"" he says. ""Our school of computer science director, Renato De Mori, was approached at a conference by one of his peers, who congratulated him on Archie and what a splendid job we were doing at McGill. We had never told the faculty about it so he had no idea what it was – but he smiled graciously and said thank you. When he got back to Montreal, he wanted to know what the hell the guy was talking about."" And why name it Archie? Because of Archie comics? ""It was 100% not named after the comics! I hate those comics, I think they're the most insipid piece of writing ever. It was just ""archive"" without a V."" Strictly speaking, the first web browser was Tim Berners-Lee's WorldWideWeb, later renamed Nexus so as to avoid confusion with the web itself. Berners-Lee created the program in 1991 while working at Cern, the European organisation for nuclear research. However, WorldWideWeb ran exclusively on the Nextstep platform, the early precursor to Apple's Mac OS X, and never reached a mass market. The first popular browser was Mosaic, which is generally credited with spreading the casual use of the web around the world. Created by University of Illinois students Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, it was first released for computers using the Unix operating system on 23 January 1993. It built on Berners-Lee's server by including support for graphics, sound and video clips. After its popularity boomed in the academic community, Andreessen and several fellow students marketed Mosaic commercially. It was a huge success, granting hundreds of thousands of people their first glimpse of the web. The began operating in 1991, the same year as Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web, and had its origins in an even more important topic in computer science: the flow of caffeine around a research group. The group, based in Cambridge University's computer lab and led by Dr Quentin Stafford-Fraser, had a problem: the coffee machine was shared by others in more distant parts of the building. ""These poor souls would often arrive, mug in hand, to find no fresh coffee,"" explains Stafford-Fraser. ""So one afternoon, friends and I gripped an old camera in a retort stand and connected it to a spare computer, then wrote a program [known as XCoffee] that allowed anyone in our group to display a live image of the pot in the corner of their screen. ""When, in 1993, web browsers were first able to display images, my colleague Dan Gordon modified the software so that a browser could take the place of our program. As a side effect, the whole world could see the image. Millions did, and so the first webcam was born."" Coffeecam finally shut down in 2001, when the computer science department moved to a new building. The first blogger may never be identified for sure, but the most likely candidate is American freelance journalist Justin Hall, who began blogging (not that the term then existed) in 1994 with a website called Justin's Links From The Underground. Hall was online early enough to get first dibs on the coveted URL, and his website began as a sort of guided tour of the internet. It wasn't long, however, before Hall's personal life became the principal topic. Hall wrote candidly about his relationships, passions, plans and fears, sharing just about everything with his loyal readership. At one point he took a road trip across America, updating readers along the way. As for the terms, ""weblog"" was coined by the Jorn Barger in December 1997, and later abbreviated to ""blog"" by his fellow American Peter Merholz. Whether he called it blogging or not, though, Hall had been at it years before everyone else. Cyberia, Britain's first cyber cafe , was set up in 1994 on the ground floor of the offices in Whitfield Street, central London. It was the brainchild of EasyNet founders Eva Pascoe, Gené McPherson, Keith Teare and David Rowe, and quickly became place to be seen for the digerati, with Mick Jagger attending its website launch and its female founders attaining minor-celebrity status. The franchise was soon extended across the world – with outlets in Paris, Bangkok, Tokyo, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester and Rotterdam – but eventually folded, its founders moving on to other projects. Teare looks back fondly: ""It was 150 miles an hour for four years. And now there are hundreds of thousands of them, worldwide. Not Cyberias of course; just plain old cyber cafes. Never was a great business – but it was a great experience."" The French-Iranian programmer Pierre Omidyar launched AuctionWeb in September 1995. It was later renamed . There had been other virtual auction sites, but this one was better designed and better marketed. The first item to change hands at auction was a broken laser pointer offered by Omidyar himself, finally purchased for $14.83. Omidyar had the courtesy to contact the winning bidder and warn them they were buying faulty goods, but the buyer claimed to collect broken laser pointers, so the sale went through. ""Wikis"" date back to 1995, when software developer Ward Cunningham launched WikiWikiWeb, named after the shuttle buses at Honolulu airport (""wiki"" means fast in Hawaiian, and in internet terms refers to the collaborative generation of content). The software's innovative application would later prove the key to the extraordinary success of , which itself originated in a free-content reference project known as , founded in 2000 by American entrepreneur Jimmy Wales. Wales hired the philosophy academic Larry Sanger to run what they defined as ""a open, publicly editable series of web pages"". The first article, quite randomly, was ""atonality"", written by German academic Christoph Hust. But there was a flaw in the plan: after a year only 12 articles had been published because of the need for fact-checking and editing. It was not until 2004, when the collaborative wiki software was utilised, that Wikipedia was unleashed. Unfortunately, all of its original articles have been lost, as initially the software didn't save history as it does today. But the first words that appeared on , typed by Wales, were ""hello world"". ""Once the wiki started, lots of people began to contribute, and that's when I realised it was pretty exciting and could really take off,"" Wales says now. ""Except that obviously it's a bit big bigger than I ever imagined."" From the outset the internet was all about connecting people, with proto-social networks evident even in the early days of Arpanet and bulletin boards. But the pioneering US site was far closer to the model of social networking sites such as that dominate today, and inspired a host of imitations including in the UK. Classmates.com began life in 1995 in the basement of former Boeing employee Randy Conrads. It was an instant hit, playing on many an American's desire to swap life stories with former friends or reignite a high-school romance (after the first 100 marriages, in 2002, they stopped counting). Conrads came up with the idea when he started attending reunions himself: ""I thought there was a lot of strength in high-school affinities, the desire to get together and travel long distances and spend a lot of money in hotels in order to talk to each other, and the internet, as it grew, could be a place for people to connect like that. I thought if I could do it for all high schools, maybe I could make a business."" Conrads was the first person registered on the site, and soon he was not only rekindling friendships from the military school he attended abroad, but getting his classmates to invest in and work for the company. ""Running into those people again has been the start of several special relationships with some of the people I went to school with – not all, though."" It wasn't the first dotcom to go bust, but Boo was definitely the most high-profile of the first tranche of failures. Set up by two extremely well-connected Swedes, former poetry critic Ernst Malmsten and Vogue model Kajsa Leander, with the backing of some big business guns, Boo.com seemed to have a lot going for it when its was unveiled in the autumn of 1999. But the Boo story quickly morphed into an emperor's-new-clothes type yarn. Aspiring to be an online Harvey Nichols, it soon had a staff of 500 across seven countries hosting famously lavish parties. But the buzz dotcom brand of the moment was, in reality, a poorly functioning website in a market that didn't yet have the appetite to buy high-end designs online – these were the days of snail-paced internet connections and low-resolution design. Eighteen months down the line, with £90m squandered, no one seemed that surprised when everything went horribly wrong. In his final memo to staff, Malmsten said simply: ""I'm sorry that in the end we couldn't turn things around, and maybe that was my fault."" It has been said before, but here it is again: is four years old. Four! The YouTube story began so astonishingly recently, in fact, that one of the events that inspired it was Janet Jackson's dress malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl – or rather, the fact that you couldn't find footage of it anywhere on the web. Little over a year later, former employees Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim had filled the gaping whole in the internet market for a video sharing facility. The first video on the site was posted on 23 April 2005, and remains there today. "" "" is a man called Karim's 18-second long report from the elephant enclosure at San Diego zoo. It's both dull and awkward, enlivened only by a strange message flashing up half-way through exclaiming: ""Can you hear the goat. Meeeeeeh!!"" But its historical significance means that it has had well over a million hits so far."
1966	1967	Taxi Driver 	corsese's (1976) is being re-presented for its 30th anniversary in the most intelligent context possible - as part of a Bernard Herrmann season at London's National Film Theatre. It was the great movie composer's final score: a compelling mixture of sinuous jazz and a declamatory orchestral soundtrack, denoting as nothing else could a presentiment of catastrophe. Robert De Niro's insomniac New York taxi driver, Travis Bickle, driven mad by driving around the hellish streets at night, has a humiliating date with a political activist (Cybill Shepherd) who is way out of his league, and becomes a would-be assassin, moreover conceiving an obsession with an underage prostitute, unforgettably played by Jodie Foster. No other movie can plunge you, so sensuously and so completely, into the forgotten 70s New York of checkered cabs and porno-chic, with all the extraordinary sights and sounds: like that pop-eyed busking drummer with the jet-black hair demonstrating indistinguishable percussion styles to uncaring passers-by. He turns up in my dreams on a pretty regular basis. I haven't seen Taxi Driver since I was a student, when I used to watch it about once a fortnight. But seeing it again on the big screen showed me how much I'd forgotten and how much I never saw in the first place. Scorsese himself makes two creepy cameo appearances, not one. Paul Schrader's script has one of Travis's cabbie acquaintances making a joke about Bertrand Russell - possibly even in reference to the great anecdote about a London taxi driver asking Russell the meaning of life. That under-remembered political storyline shows the movie's consanguinity with Robert Altman's Nashville and Michael Ritchie's The Candidate and it shows that to the list of everything that has borrowed from Taxi Driver since 1976, we must add TV's The West Wing, whose Josh character is surely derived from Albert Brooks, the nerdy, lovelorn aide. The main thing I'd forgotten was the extraordinary parody-happy-ending coda, in which Travis does indeed succeed in impressing Cybill Shepherd with his psychotic bloodbath: and frankly it isn't too hard to see how deranged John Hinckley got the message for his own attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981. is almost radioactive with charisma, and the charm and magnetism of his extended dialogue scenes with Shepherd and Foster have a relaxed directness that later he was, sadly, to lose by acquiring repetitious tics and mannerisms. What a mad and brilliant film it is: 1,000-degree proof Seventies cinema.
1967	1968	The talented Ms Highsmith 	"n life the novelist habitually drew strong reactions from those around her. Like Brigitte Bardot, she appears to have reserved most of her affection for animals: when she died, in 1995, she left behind 22 novels, mostly studies of everyday psychopathy, and a lifetime's worth of sketches of cats. Her sometime publisher Otto Penzler described her as a ""mean, cruel, hard, unlovable, unloving human being"" - and he was a fan. Nor is Highsmith likely to find immortality as a feminist icon: her early books are notable for their negative portrayal of female characters. When questioned about her preference for male heroes, the author would reply: ""Women are tied to the home... Men can do more, jump over fences."" But, as we all know, a bad character has never been a bar to creating good art, and Highsmith's claustrophobic studies of commonplace deviancy have been entertaining and appalling readers for a half-century now. In particular, they have found a receptive audience among film-makers. When Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley opens across the UK next month, it will be almost exactly 50 years since Highsmith was first adapted for the big screen. That initial cinematic translation was in 1951, with Strangers on a Train by , and it made Highsmith famous - not to say well-off - overnight. In the intervening period, many others have felt drawn to the author's gallery of literary sociopaths: Claude-Autant Lara (Le Meutrier, 1963), Claude Miller (Dites-lui que je l'aime, 1977), Michel Deville (Eaux Profondes, 1981) and Claude Chabrol (Le Cri du Hibou, 1987) have all made films based on her work. In addition there have been two previous attempts to adapt Highsmith's most celebrated creation, the genial psychopath Tom Ripley: René Clément filmed The Talented Mr Ripley as Plein Soleil, starring a very young Alain Delon, in 1960 (reissued in 1997 by Miramax, the company behind Minghella's version), while a later volume in Highsmith's Ripley series, Ripley's Game, was the basis for Wim Wenders's 1977 The American Friend. But just as the foregoing list attests to Highsmith's popularity with film-makers (particularly ones called Claude), it also shows a marked bias for her work among European cinéastes. There is no real mystery about Hollywood's shyness where Highsmith is concerned, for the author - though an American - was positively opposed to the key film industry tenet that the good should be rewarded and the wicked punished. As she once said, ""I find the public passion for justice quite boring and artificial, for neither life nor nature cares if justice is ever done or not."" No one who knows Highsmith only through American screen adaptations will therefore have much of a sense of the novels' characteristic moral climate. Hitchcock's version of Strangers on a Train has little in common with its source material beyond a general misogyny and an opening proposition - two men, one a psychopath, one not, meet on a train and discuss their difficulties with their respective families. Suddenly the psychopath slams his palms together and cries out euphorically: ""Hey! Cheeses. What an idea! We murder for each other, see? I kill your wife and you kill my father! We meet on a train, see, and nobody knows we know each other! Perfect alibis! Catch?"" Thereafter film and novel diverge significantly. In the cinema version the good guy is never allowed even to contemplate going through with his side of the bargain - at worst he risks being thought guilty by other people. In the novel, on the other hand, the honest citizen actually carries out the killing and becomes possessed by guilt; such is Highsmith's skill that the process by which he comes to commit the murder seems entirely logical, and all the more terrible for that. As Susannah Clapp observed in a recent issue of the New Yorker: ""In Highsmith, the corruption of good intentions is so insidious that it comes to seem a perfectly natural process."" Conventional notions of justice - legal, divine, poetic - have no force in Highsmith's world. Highsmith does not appear to have invited discussion of her personal life, but the established biographical facts are none the less worth rehearsing. Her parents separated five months before she was born, in Fort Worth, Texas in 1921, and she was raised initially by her grandmother. This happy period was cut short when she was summoned to join her mother in New York, where the two women appear to have formed a lethal partnership worthy of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?; mother taunting daughter by relating how she had tried to abort her foetus during pregnancy. ""She really tried to get rid of it - she told me - I didn't mind,"" Highsmith later remembered. ""She said, 'It's funny you adore the smell of turpentine, Pat'. Because she drank turpentine before I was born trying to have a miscarriage. I didn't mind."" It is an extraordinary story, not least for the way in which Highsmith tells it, managing to make a monstrous revelation seem entirely ordinary, an effect that Highsmith achieves again and again in her fiction. In the circumstances it is perhaps understandable that Highsmith hated her mother and blamed her for her own later inability to live with others. As a young adult, the novelist toyed with various careers, briefly pursuing writing for comic books: interested readers can still find the children's title Miranda the Panda is On the Veranda in the collection of the British Library. She almost became a painter, too. It will come as no surprise to learn that she was particularly drawn to the work of Francis Bacon: humanity vomiting into a toilet bowl struck a chord. But recognition as a writer was not long withheld from her. In 1945 her first short story, The Heroine, was published in Harper's Bazaar. Soon after, on a recommendation from Truman Capote, she went to stay at the Yaddo writers' colony, redrafted Strangers on a Train, found a publisher in Harper & Sons and achieved international success - though, mirroring the tastes of film-makers, her books have traditionally had a larger audience in Europe than in the US. The novelist herself moved to Britain and France in the 1960s before finally settling in Switzerland. When it was first published in 1950, Strangers on a Train was advertised by its publishers as ""A Harper Novel of Suspense"". If you go in search of a copy today, you will discover that the label has stuck, for her works are usually kept in the specialist crime or thriller sections of bookstores rather than among general fiction. Although Highsmith is still thought of as a genre writer, her most obvious literary relations are rather grander than the classification would suggest. In the first place there is Henry James, another European-American puritan obsessed with the isolated consciousness and the destructive powers of the imagination: a James tale such as Maud-Evelyn shares many of the preoccupations of Highsmith's This Sweet Sickness. James's influence is hinted at explicitly in The Talented Mr Ripley when Mr Green leaf asks Tom if he has ever read The Ambassadors - in fact the plot of Ripley, in which an American is sent to Europe to try to persuade a fellow countryman to return home, is borrowed directly from James, albeit with an important twist. However, the literary movement that most obviously marks Highsmith's work is European existentialism, from her beloved Dostoevsky and Gide through to Camus and Sartre - it is one of the constant lessons of these tales of individuals destroying one another that hell is other people. Viewed in his proper postwar context, Tom Ripley is at once a psychopath and an existentialist hero. The series of books that Highsmith devoted to him - The Talented Mr Ripley (1955), Ripley Underground (1970), Ripley's Game (1974), The Boy Who Followed Ripley (1980) and Ripley Under Water (1990) - are a classic, if rather perverse, existentialist statement of the freedom of the individual to recreate him- or herself. Moreover, Ripley's murder of Dickie Greenleaf in the perfect tranquillity of San Remo is not without an echo in another seaside murder, that committed by Meursault in Camus's The Outsider. In the existentialist tradition, the irrationality of human behaviour is an abiding theme. As Graham Greene wrote of Highsmith: ""Her characters are irrational and they leap to life in the very lack of reason; suddenly we realise how unbelievably rational most fictional characters are."" One of the principal experiences of reading the novels is frustration: the reader's terrible sense of entrapment that comes with having to follow the mental processes of a character who consistently refuses to act in his own best interests. When, in A Suspension of Mercy, the writer Sydney Bartleby sets out to behave in a way that makes him seem guilty of his wife's murder, the reader is left to despair at the terrible lucidity of a consciousness ensnaring itself in absurdist Kafkaesque traps of its own devising. Isolation, absurdity, irrationality: the philosophical essence of Highsmith's fiction is not obviously cinematic. As Russell Harrison points out in his monograph on the writer, it is the absence or displacement of many of the staples of realistic fiction that gives the novels their compelling, unique oddness. Politics, social observation, sex - these are all simply missing from most of Highsmith's earliest and best work. Sex, or the lack of it, in Highsmith is particularly intriguing. Highsmith presents a world in which her characters are cut adrift, determined neither by family nor work duties. The consequences of removing all such moral and professional props can be spectacularly disorientating. When Ripley is about to kill Richard Greenleaf, we are told: ""He could have hit Dickie, sprung on him, or kissed him, or thrown him overboard."" That there is a homoerotic element in the relationships drawn by Highsmith between her male characters has not passed unremarked by critics, nor by Minghella in his screen adaptation of The Talented Mr Ripley. However, in the novels, faced with the choice between killing or kissing, Highsmith's creations will almost invariably choose the former. There is one notable exception, however, for in an early work Highsmith did experiment with allowing her characters more explicit sexual existences and a conventional ""happy ending"". The novel in question is The Price of Salt, which was first published in 1952 under the pseudonym Claire Morgan and which rapidly became an underground lesbian classic, selling nearly a million copies. When Highsmith finally owned up to the work in 1990, her explanation for the upbeat treatment of the gay lovers had a familiarly perverse ring, although here her insistence on going against the grain will strike most readers as more humane in its motivation: she had, she said, allowed the couple to find happiness in their relationship because ""homosexuals male and female in American novels have had to pay for their deviation by cutting their wrists, drowning themselves in a swimming pool, or by switching to heterosexuality."" Ironically, The Price of Salt is one of the rare occasions when Highsmith's fiction indulges the desire for poetic justice so beloved of Hollywood producers - but, given its explicit subject matter and its leading female roles, it is probably the least likely of Highsmith's novels to be adapted for big-screen presentation.  The Talented Mr Ripley is released on February 25."
1971	1972	Oscars 2010: is Kathryn Bigelow's victory a win for women? 	"fter every Oscar ceremony, observers traditionally attempt to distil a zeitgeisty trend from the proceedings, and the one available here would appear to be obvious. Yesterday, on International Women's Day in fact, we woke up to hear that had become the first woman to win the best director award in the Oscars' 82-year history. Women have, of course, been extravagantly admired as prizewinning actors at the and always been expected to provide the glamorous media faces of the Academy Award ceremony, the red-carpet icons and fashion queens. But never before has a woman actually been distinguished for being at the creative and administrative helm: and it is difficult to tell if there is really any feminist meaning to this, or if Bigelow is a Thatcherite anomaly. Either way, for her to have won so massively with such a male-orientated film in such a male-orientated industry is a significant victory. And the fact that so little fuss is made about it is, arguably, a heartening sign – an indication that the academy will be unself-conscious about picking a woman next year, or the year after that. itself was a classic Oscar landslide: like Slumdog Millionaire last year, the consensus tipping-point was reached that this film was a very good thing, propelled by great reviews and also, perhaps, by its perceived underdog status. Quite suddenly, as if by some mysterious chemical reaction, everything went its way and Avatar, the hugely hyped box-office behemoth, was disappointed. The Hurt Locker really is a brilliant film about the strain, fear and sheer boredom of war, but also, like many anti-war films, it also provides a lot of the old-fashioned excitement that is generally associated with action films. Jeremy Renner, playing the sociopathic, cigarette-smoking bomb-disposal technician, terminally addicted to the army life, does bear a strong visual resemblance to Marine Lance Corporal James Blake Miller, who became famous in the US after being snapped by news photographers in Falluja in 2004, smoking a cigarette in an unconscious ""Marlboro man"" pose. Everything about this film is intensely male; there is a sweaty, sour and defeatedly masculine tang seeping out of every frame. Perhaps, in retrospect, it was not so startling for a woman director to have made it, and to have provided the shrewd perspective on this maleness. Elsewhere, well, there was not too much to cheer about at the Oscars on the feminist front, or any other. Jane Campion, a brilliant director with her Keats movie – the best film of her career – was nowhere to be seen. Jeff Bridges was a popular winner, though the sentimental Country & Western drama was not his best work, all heart and no crazy. The prize for Sandra Bullock (surely the least deserving winner of the five nominees) seemed to tap into a robustly Palinesque admiration for tough-minded hockey moms everywhere, and any perceived liberal-feminist trend in the Bigelow prize has to be balanced by Bullock's unlikely triumph. Bullock has never been nominated before and has never exactly been an awards contender, but is instead notable chiefly for having garnered a guarded industry respect for being a solid box-office draw outside the US. She also won a Razzie this weekend for the unspeakable All About Steve, becoming the first performer to get an Oscar and a Razzie in the same year. Perhaps it won't be long before someone gets the Oscar and the Razzie for the same performance. The best supporting actor awards for Christoph Waltz and Mo'Nique were the right decisions, however. The Union flag was certainly not being raised, and in fact no flag other than the star-spangled banner seemed to be terribly important. It was an awful night for Michael Haneke's and Jacques Audiard's , confined to the best foreign film ghetto where they were defeated by the Argentinian thriller The Secret of My Eyes. The Haneke and Audiard films were both widely hailed as modern classics but ignored by an academy that is highly receptive to critical kudos where these opinions appear to be sympathetic to the US military and US concerns, but pretty indifferent otherwise. This was a clunkingly disconcerting moment at the Oscars: a reminder, if we needed it, that the Academy Awards will always give us a vivid, muddled snapshot of the American mood, but no very compelling or focused view of what's happening elsewhere in the world of cinema."
1980	1981	Tom Hanks: type 2 diabetes diagnosis means end of weightier roles 	" admitted his days of dramatically gaining and losing weight for movie parts were well behind him, as he spoke of his diagnosis for type 2 diabetes. Hanks was speaking before the European premiere of his new film Captain Phillips – based on the hijacking by Somali pirates of a Maersk cargo ship in 2009 – which opened the on Wednesday night. The tense and exciting film, directed by Paul Greengrass in a style familiar to anyone who has seen Bloody Sunday and United 93, is being tipped for Oscar success, with Hanks's commanding performance attracting much praise. The actor – who lost 13kg (two stone) for Philadelphia and 25kg for Castaway, and gained 13kg for A League of Their Own – said that ""may have had something to do"" with his having type 2 diabetes, ""because you eat so much bad food and you don't get any exercise when you're heavy"". But Hanks said he had had the symptoms for 20 years. ""I think I was genetically inclined to get it and I think it goes back to a lifestyle I've been leading since I was probably seven, as opposed to 36."" He said he was healthy and good on things like cholesterol, ""it just so happens that my body type and my lifestyle gives me a preclusion for high blood sugars"". The losing and gaining of weight for an actor was a young man's game, he said. ""I've talked to a number of actors who have gained weight for roles, and just the sheer physical toll it puts on one's knees and shoulders – no one wants to do it again. I'm 57 and I don't think I'm going to take on any job or go on vacation again and see to it that I can gain 30 pounds."" For Captain Phillips he met the real Rich Phillips twice to talk through the ordeal and also understand the complexities of being a cargo ship captain. Phillips was in charge of the Maersk Alabama sailing from Oman to Mombasa when it was boarded by four Somali pirates who then took the captain hostage on the boat's lifeboat before its dramatic rescue by the US navy. Greengrass interviewed all the ship's crew and carried out meticulous research, but of course there were omissions and compressions, he said. Hanks told journalists: ""It's not a documentary and even in the first meetings I had with Rich I said 'Look, I'm going to say things you never said and do things you did not do but, based on that, let's get as close to the DNA of authenticity as possible.'"" Hanks appeared on the red carpet on Wednesday night and will be again at the 57th festival's end as he also stars in the closing film, Saving Mr Banks, in which he plays Walt Disney alongside Emma Thompson as the Mary Poppins writer PL Travers. In between there will be a further 232 feature films shown with organisers keen to build on the success of last year when the festival saw a 13% rise in attendances from 133,000 to 151,000."
1984	1985	Philomena – review 	"Philomena is something yearned for and lusted after by film-makers and journalists alike – a really good story. It's a powerful and heartfelt drama, based on a real case, with a sledgehammer emotional punch and a stellar performance from , along with an intelligently judged supporting contribution from . Yet the film's apparent simplicity and force come to us flavoured with subtle nuances and subtexts, left there by the people who brought this story to the public. At its centre is a tough-minded, elderly Irish woman, Philomena Lee (Dench), and her battle to find out what happened to the baby boy taken away from her in the 1950s. As a teenage unmarried mother, she had been forced to put up her child for adoption, while working in one of the Irish Republic's penitential Magdalene laundries, which survived until the 1980s. These cottage industries of shame and self-hate were run by nuns and priests who had a nasty secret of their own: they discreetly accepted substantial sums of money from America's childless Catholic couples. It was a baby-farm business model that ran on cruelty and hypocrisy. Peter Mullan's 2002 film was a memorably fierce denunciation. But the film is also about a former media apparatchik's personal need for a redemptive act of goodness after being mired in the shabby and inglorious world of political spin. And at a level below that, the film could also be about a comedian and actor working through his own strong feelings about what he feels to be two malign institutions: the Church and Fleet Street. Coogan is the producer and co-writer of Philomena, and he plays Martin Sixsmith, the former BBC correspondent turned New Labour political adviser who, in 2002, was ousted from his job in an unedifying row over smear allegations and a leaked email. (The film is adapted from Sixsmith's own book.) Unhappily returning to work as a freelance journalist, he chances across the extraordinary story of Philomena, played by Dench with such effortless poise, serio-comic charm and heart-tugging potency. Sixsmith takes to America on a mission to track down her lost son. Such a savvy operator as Sixsmith must surely have been aware of the case of Labour frontbencher Clare Short, who in 1996 was sensationally reunited with the son she had given away 31 years earlier: a well-publicised good news story for New Labour in opposition. That is not mentioned here. This movie puts party politics to one side to concentrate on what Coogan's Sixsmith is shown initially deriding as a ""human interest"" story: mid-market newspaper slush. Yet he takes it on and they make the oddest of couples. Martin is the high flyer who has risen in the amoral worlds of politics and the media. Philomena is the working-class woman who holds on to one clear moral fact: what the church did to her was wrong, but she doesn't want revenge, only the truth. The story of Philomena's teenage self – she is played as a young woman by Sophie Kennedy Clark – is gruelling. We are used to Dickensian images of destitute old married couples in the 19th century being separated for ever at the doors of the English workhouses: for men and for women. There's similar agony and lump-in-the-throat desolation in seeing the teenage mums having their babies taken away from them. And all of it sanctified in the name of Mary Magdalene, who received from Christ a compassion that is nowhere visible now. What Sixsmith and Philomena discover in the US is gripping. Dench shows how Philomena is scared, but has reserves of humour and courage that Sixsmith, for all his sophistication, can't match. There is a touch of Crocodile Dundee in Philomena's wide-eyed presence in the big city, of course, but it is great stuff from Dench. Coogan's performance is more opaque. To some extent, his Sixsmith can never overtly seek redemption, since he never concedes he did anything wrong. But quite aside from this consideration, Coogan keeps everything pretty low key, even his anger, though there is one Partridgean moment as he savours the fruited bread the nuns give him for tea. Coogan is an excellent actor, but rarely has the chance to show it. With great restraint, he doesn't really give himself the opportunity here, leaving the dramatic and moral focus with Dench. Director guides this arrangement with a sure hand. Coogan has spoken publicly of his atheism and Catholic background. But what is really interesting is how his character adopts, and even embraces, the tactics of popular journalism. In pursuit of an interview, his Sixsmith literally shoves his foot in the door. But this kind of ""human interest"" journalism does real good: it gets at the truth and gives people closure, justifications of which the public has grown suspicious. Could it be that Coogan, the great accuser and challenger of the press, is conducting a creative thought-experiment? Turning the journalists into the good guys? At any rate, the result is a moving and exhilarating film, and the strange chemistry between Dench and Coogan ferments into a 120-degree proof emotional drama."
1986	1987	Pride & Prejudice 	t is a truth by Universal acknowledged that a British producer in possession of Hollywood finance must be in want of a period screenplay. So it's scarcely surprising that the British production company Working Title, having disappointed its American financiers Universal Studios with the contemporary comedy, Wimbledon, should turn to Jane Austen's perennially popular 1813 novel, Pride and Prejudice Admittedly, Merchant-Ivory fell on their elegant faces with their foolish miscalculation Jane Austen in Manhattan, but generally Austen adaptations have gone down well, especially Pride and Prejudice. There was a chocolate-box MGM version in 1940 starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, both well into their 30s, as Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet; a Broadway musical used to launch the reopened Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1991 featuring Patricia Routledge as Mrs Bennet; numerous broadcast adaptations (most famously, the Andrew Davis treatment featuring Colin Firth's Darcy); and Gurinder Chadha's Bollywood extravaganza, Bride and Prejudice The first film for the cinema by , an established TV director, working from a script by novelist and TV playwright Deborah Moggach, this widescreen Pride & Prejudice is a brisk affair with a narrative drive that finds relatively little time for reflection. It plunges straight into the story of Mrs Bennet's justified obsession with marrying off her five daughters by having Mr Bennet reveal that he's already visited the wealthy, eligible young newcomer, Mr Bingley, before his wife has urged him. Within minutes, we're at the unfashionable ball at the local assembly rooms where the boisterous proceedings are immediately silenced by the arrival of Bingley, his sister (he has only one here) and his best friend, the even richer bachelor, Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). The latter's pride and arrogance immediately antagonise the spirited Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), second eldest Bennet daughter and the one, for obvious reasons, best liked by her sardonic, ironic father (Donald Sutherland). It is Bennet's inability to produce a male heir that has exposed his family to possible future poverty as their relatively humble Hertfordshire estate is entailed so that a cousin, the Reverend Collins (Tom Hollander), will inherit it on Bennet's death. It is appropriate, therefore, that after endless intrigues, proposals made and rejected, social signals misunderstood, lives enhanced and depressed, and an elopement, the film version ends not with marriages but with Bennet's final resigned quip to Elizabeth after giving his blessing to her forthcoming union with Darcy. Having seen three daughters married off, he says: 'If any young men come for Marty or Kitty, send them in for I am quite at leisure', and the film fades to black. There is, presumably, no way of making Mrs Bennet sympathetic and in Brenda Blethyn's uningratiating performance, she's the mother from Hertfordshire as the mother from hell and more grotesque than funny. Oddly enough, the outstanding figures in the movie, and the best performances, are both male. Not Darcy or Bingley or Wickham, who are all on the callow side, but the pair at the opposite ends of the spectrum, the wise, witty, understanding Mr Bennet, whose best characteristics Elizabeth has inherited, and the odious Reverend Collins, a man as unctuous as Uriah Heep, though sad and self-deceiving rather than hypocritical. Hollander's performance is a comic study in embarrassment and there is a peculiarly painful moment when the diminutive Collins stands behind the tall, imposing Darcy at a ball, attempting to attract his attention as a prelude to a terrible rebuff. The strength of McFadyen's Darcy is that he's not so obviously charismatic as to make Elizabeth's initial rejection implausible. The strength of Knightley's Elizabeth is the way we see her grow in self-knowledge and confidence, concluding in her celebrated showdown with Darcy's imperious aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, played by Judi Dench like Lady Bracknell without the jokes. Knightley, with her small features and physical fragility, bears a strong resemblance to Winona Ryder as Jo in Little Women, though at one point she's placed on a promontory in the Peak District during her visit to Darcy's Derbyshire mansion, which makes her resemble a Bronte heroine. The movie is well designed and its locations intelligently chosen. Most importantly, the various houses accurately reflect the social gradations of their owners: the red-brick and tile of Langbourne, where the Bennets live in rough comfort at the centre of a working farm where pigs, ducks and chickens cavort around the doorsteps; Collins's dark, repressive vicarage; Bingley's fine country house with its polished floors, footmen and neoclassical furniture; and the contrasted grandeur of Darcy's place in Derbyshire, light, tasteful, welcoming, and Lady Catherine's mansion in Kent, deliberately overwhelming in its heavy furnishing, murals and platoon of liveried servants. The production designer is Sarah Greenwood.
1987	1988	Shame – review 	"teve McQueen's film about a damaged sibling relationship, co-written with Abi Morgan, is a nightmarish, laugh-free black comedy about neurosis and dysfunction. It has the same icy, unwavering stare as his previous work, Hunger, about the Irish republican hunger-striker Bobby Sands, with the same degree-zero long camera takes. stars as Brandon, a sleek young executive in New York, and a single guy who is fanatically, even ecstatically, addicted to casual sex, prostitutes and porn. It's an addiction that is strip-mining his personality of all recognisable human impulses. He is living in a hell that he has furnished and maintained himself, but it was made by someone else. A clue to this lies in his desperately unhappy screwup of a sister, Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan. To Brandon's dismay, Sissy announces she is going to be crashing at his bachelor pad while following her dream of being a singer, cramping his style and annoying the hell out of him. Somehow Sissy and Brandon are always catching each other naked: he stumbles on her in the shower and she blunders into the bathroom while he is jerking off. Sissy is actually rather less damaged than he is, and McQueen allows us to create our own speculation about the siblings' background to run alongside the film. As one scene follows the next, theories will run though the audience's mind. Sissy drops one tiny, ambiguous hint at the very end. Brandon is a sex-connoisseur and sex-sociopath, a zombified version of Bret Easton Ellis's Patrick Bateman or Martin Amis's John Self. He is an obsessive-compulsive seducer with particular mannerisms of dress, always going out to work in an overcoat fastidiously accessorised with a scarf. Brandon takes the subway and brazenly catches women's glances in the train carriages; we are introduced to him through a scene that is coolly controlled and modulated. An attractive woman smiles back at Brandon's lethally, telepathically sexual gaze. She starts to look a little turned on – forget phone sex, this is subway sex – before realising what is happening and looking embarrassed, then horrified. McQueen shows a whole narrative unfolding in a series of tiny gestures and expressions. In the office, his boss delicately tells him his porn-clogged computer hard drive has had to be removed to be ""cleaned up"" and Brandon repairs to the office men's room, where he ferociously cleans germs from the lavatory seat with toilet paper, and McQueen coolly ends the scene before we can tell if Brandon is going to urinate or masturbate. It is Brandon's unspeakable boss Dave, played by James Badge Dale, who ushers in the movie's most agonising scene. Dave is a married man with a family out in the suburbs; he turns a blind eye to Brandon's office-porn habit, but Brandon evidently has to come out with him in the evenings as an embarrassed wing man, while Dave trawls the city's bars to pick up women, though all of his targets clearly find Brandon far more attractive. (Dave resembles the Manhattan lothario played by Campbell Scott in Dylan Kidd's 2002 movie Roger Dodger.) One night, Brandon takes Dave to see Sissy sing at a bar, and it is a revelation. Using one of his signature extended shots, a closeup on Sissy's face, McQueen shows that Sissy is actually a very talented singer. Her version of New York, New York is daringly slow and ruminative, a wan, sometimes slightly dissonant interpretation that is completely non-Glee. (Brandon himself has Glenn Gould's controversial ""slow"" recording of the Goldberg Variations on his turntable: a rather Hannibal Lecterish touch.) The song clearly speaks of her yearning to escape and Brandon is profoundly affected. But after this performance appears miraculously to have healed her self-esteem … poor, lonely Sissy comes eagerly over to where Brandon and his predatory, sleazeball-philanderer boss are sitting. Having seen Dave's shame in failing with hot women the night before, Brandon must now be complicit in this new unfolding situation, and is ashamed on his and her behalf; it all leads to a hypnotically awful taxi ride back to their place. It would be sitcomishly funny if it weren't so clenched with humiliation and swallowed rage. When Brandon attempts a dinner date with Marianne (Nicole Beharie) – a beautiful co-worker in his office – it is an uncomfortably real transcription of a supposedly romantic evening: another long, static camera shot. It starts with stilted conversation, ends with a spark, but is followed by a catastrophic tryst in which there is nothing but emotional degradation. McQueen shows how Brandon has no way of communicating except sex, and can't have sex with someone he genuinely likes. Tellingly, in bed, he asks Marianne if her underwear is ""vintage"": precisely the term Sissy had used to describe her wacky and bohemian hat. McQueen allows us to register the word-association almost subliminally: the vital sheen of porn-indifference he needs is killed by the fatal spark of gentleness and intimacy. Shame is an interesting title: Brandon feels spasms of disgust and self-pity more than shame, but the point is rather that shame lies deeply buried under all of this. Brandon and Sissy live in an underworld melodrama of fear – not so much Crime and Punishment, but Addiction and Humiliation. With tremendous performances from Fassbender and Mulligan, and such superb technique from McQueen, this is a horrible inferno."
1989	1990	Cannes 2013: Coen brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis on song for Palme d'Or 	"Despite a day lashed by biblical torrents of rain, critics had a spring in their step as they left Cannes' Palais des Festivals on Saturday night, elbowing their way into a forest of umbrellas. The explanation was simple: , the Coen brothers' latest offering, was roundly greeted as a joyful masterpiece and a serious contender for this year's Palme d'Or. If the brothers did win, it would be the first time the Cannes favourites have taken the top prize since 1991, when Barton Fink was awarded the Palme. Inside Llewyn Davis is set in 1961 in New York, amid the folk-revival scene from which Bob Dylan would emerge. But this is not a story about the singer-songwriter, whom Ethan Coen called ""the elephant in the room"" of the film. The story, inspired by the memoir of folk singer Dave Van Ronk, instead takes as its main character a struggling artist teetering between success and failure, who would later be eclipsed by what its star, Oscar Isaac, described as ""the poet, the abstract thinker"" that Dylan became. It is about, said Joel Coen, ""the lesser-known scene that Dylan came into as such a transformative figure"". Justin Timblerlake, who plays Llewyn Davis's friend and fellow singer John, contrasted the milieu of the film with today's frenetic music scene. ""I would argue that – and I think this is happening more and more – that there's a lot of analysis now about what's likely to be successful and what's a failure,"" he said. Such obsession with music's marketability was a distraction from artistry. ""The most important thing is not to get caught up in the rat race of what might be perceived a certain way,"" he said. Isaac, breaking through into his first major leading film role, is the heart and soul of Inside Llewyn Davis, which contains lengthy sequences of him performing entire songs. Ethan Coen called the search for the lead ""a casting challenge; we were screwed before we met Oscar Isaac"", who is a classically trained guitarist. Music producer T Bone Burnett, who performed with Dylan, said: ""The odds against us making the film at all were very long. The odds against us finding Oscar Isaac were one in 17 million."" John's wife, Jean, also a singer, is played by . Inside Llewyn Davis is the British actor's second appearance at this year's Cannes, after her role as Daisy Buchanan in Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. Part of the pleasure of the film, said Ethan Coen, was hearing Mulligan ""swear like a stevedore"". She also sings in the film. ""I told them I could sing so I could get the part,"" she said. Mulligan is married to British folk artist Marcus Mumford, who worked on the film's music. Some of the lovingly recreated performances – a trio of chaps in Aran sweaters singing in close harmony, or John and Jean's songs, reminiscent of Peter, Paul and Mary – have a comic edge. But, said Joel Coen, there is no parody intended. ""I think you can tell from the movie that this music is something that we have a deep respect and fondness for. Not to say that there's nothing funny about folk music – there are plenty of funny things about folk music."""
1990	1991	Coen brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis wins best film at Gotham awards 	The Coen brothers' Cannes Grand Prix-winning picked up another award ahead of the coming Oscars season with victory in the best feature category . The Coens' poignant and elliptical vision of New York's 1960s folk scene, which stars , Oscar Isaac and John Goodman, was a fitting winner for a festival that began life as a celebration of indie film-making in America's north east. The Coens will be hoping the film helps add to their collection of four Oscars next March. The best actor award went to Matthew McConaughey for , Jean-Marc Vallée's tale of a 1980s Aids patient who takes on the federal authorities in his search for life-saving drugs. Brie Larson won best actress for her turn in , the SXSW award-winner about a young woman who works at a fostering facility for at-risk teenagers. Ryan Coogler won the breakthrough director prize for his work on race drama , a dramatisation of true life events in the early hours of New Year's Day 2009 which led to the death of a young black man at the hands of a transit policeman. Best documentary went to Joshua Oppenheimer's , which already looks likely for a tilt at the equivalent Oscar, even at this early stage, having been named best film of 2013 by Sight and Sound magazine earlier this week. The Gotham awards are not generally seen as an accurate bellwether for Oscars success, though two of last year's winners ( and ) were nominated for prizes by the Academy. Elsewhere, Disney led the charge for the annual Annie awards, which are often a useful indicator of Oscars success in the best animated film category. The studio's films and (produced by the wholly owned Pixar division) both picked up 10 nominations. DreamWorks Animation's and Universal's were just behind with nine nominations each. Other contenders this year which picked up nominations include Studio Ghibli's , another Japanese anime titled A Letter to Momo, and French hand-drawn animation . All picked up best animated feature nods. Brie Larson, Matthew McConaughey, Ryan Coogler for Michael B Jordan in Jake Shimabukuro: Beneath the Harvest Sky, dir: Gita Pullapilly
1991	1992	Inside Llewyn Davis' New York City: the 60s folk scene revisited 	The Coen brothers' latest film,  , tracks one week in the life of a folk singer in Greenwich Village, New York 1961. It’s roughly based on the life of folk artist Dave Van Ronk, who performed in The Village’s Cafe Bizarre and Porco’s Bar just before Bob Dylan arrived. The Coens said that the screenplay is sourced from Van Ronk’s memoir, The Mayor of MacDougal Street, co-authored with Elijah Wald. These days, The Village is still home to rambling guitarists and wannabe poets, but most of them go to University and aren’t relying on the MacDougal street clubs to land them a record deal. The Coens took some liberties with the heralded people, events and locations of the 1960s folklore scene, but this is what the real-life inspirations look like in New York today. The park has served as the heart of multiple generations' cultural and political movements, lingering with the scent of marijuana since at least the 1950s. It’s now the center of New York University’s Village-dominating campus, and underwent a cleansing of its radical roots to provide a more law-abiding square for the students. And though this means the resident drug dealer is probably an undercover cop, the park is still home to outdoor chess players, and busking musicians, including a select few who wheel out pianos during sunnier months. The park completed a substantial remodeling this summer, creating a more picturesque home for the feature and student films shot there almost daily.  Down the street, on the south side of the park, was once the home of Gerde's Folk City, which moved in 1970 from 11 West 4th Street to 130 West 3rd Street – now the site of the Village Underground club. This crowded one-way street was a mid-20th-century repository for romantic cafes, where Van Ronk and a cadre of other up-and-comers could be heard alongside established acts like Reverend Gary Davis. Van Ronk first saw Bob Dylan play at the still-operating Cafe Wha? The street was also home to Izzy Young's book and music store, the Folklore Center. Young used the space to connect artists who would read poetry in the store or pick up instruments to play some impromptu gigs.  In Mayor of MacDougal Street, Van Ronk and Wald describe Cafe Bizarre:  The Cafe Bizarre, which was what Allmen called his room, was the first Village coffeehouse to feature folk music – or any formal entertainment at all for that matter – and it became a howling success that shortly begat clones all over the country. In concept and design, it was a tourist trap, selling the clydes (customers) a Greenwich Village that had never existed except in the film Bell, Book and Candle. The ambiance was cut-rate Charles Addams haunted house: dark and candlelit, with fake cobwebs hanging all over everything. The waitresses were got up to look like Morticia, with fishnet stockings, long straight hair, and so much mascaa that they looked like raccoons. I swear I even saw some poor clown in a Frankenstein outfit wandering around the set.  These cafes and assortment of clubs hosted folk artists when it was a penniless occupation. Folk flag-bearers like Dylan, Peter, Paul and Mary and Pete Seeger soon changed that. MacDougal street these days sounds less like acoustic guitars and more like delivery trucks, drunken students and bicycle bell rings from food delivery people. Van Ronk’s name now marks a section of street ten minutes north of the park, just before the West Village’s Seventh Avenue border. Folk luminaries including Tom Paxton and Odetta joined a crowd of Van Ronk’s family, friends and fans in The street is around the corner from gay tavern the Stonewall Inn, which has been open since 1967 and is the site of the  – a series of violent demonstrations between patrons and the police that spurred a more vocal push for LGBT equality. Van Ronk was jailed briefly for his involvement in the riots. Less than a ten minute walk away is White Horse Tavern, where Van Ronk would listen to Dylan Thomas recite poetry. White Horse Tavern has been open since 1880 but is best known for attracting writers, musicians and activists in the 50s and 60s.
1995	1996	Oscar predictions 2014: Captain Phillips 	Argo, in that it is about an American misadventure in unstable foreign climes. Possibly also this year's Cast Away, in that it features an unshaven, imperiled adrift in open water. In April 2009 the Maersk Alabama, a US cargo ship, was seized by Somali pirates in the ocean south-east of the port city of Eyl. Spoiler alert: the ship was later freed by a the US Navy. is the fact-based account of the hijacking and rescue, adapted from Richard Phillips and Stephan Talty's book A Captain's Duty. British director showed his prowess with the resonant, true-life American crisis on his 2006 film United 93 and his action expertise with the Bourne pictures. He shot Captain Phillips in locations around Malta and off the coast of Virginia Beach, working off a screenplay by Billy Ray (who adapted The Hunger Games). Tom Hanks takes the lead as Richard Phillips, the paunchy old sea dog at the centre of the storm. Executives at Columbia, the film's distributors, will be crossing their fingers for a sixth acting nomination for an on-form Hanks (who was last shortlisted for Cast Away back in 2001). The other big prizes (best picture and director) are also conceivably within reach, bobbing tantalisingly on the near horizon. Look for Captain Phillips to mop up a number of the technical awards, with a prize for the brilliantly sinuous editing looking the most likely bet. Plus Billy Ray's taut, unflashy script deserves to at least be considered for the best adapted screenplay Oscar. And Hanks will be looking to join Daniel Day Lewis with a hat-trick of best actor . Captain Phillips rolls into contention on the basis of Hanks's potent performance and Greengrass's sweaty, expert handling of a story that's been torn from the headlines. Academy voters love Tom Hanks and they love a true-ish tale in which everyday Americans face once-in-a-lifetime challenges. Does this true-life story have the scope and the weight the Academy requires? Argo's skill was in finding a left-field route through a major crisis with ongoing global implications, yet Captain Phillips offers a straightforward account of a standalone, free-floating event. If the coordinates are even slightly out, the film may find itself filed as just another scaremongering Hollywood disaster movie - a debased film genre that is typically regarded as just one step up from the slasher flick. Captain Phillips has its maiden voyage at the New York film festival this weekend, before popping into port to open the London film festival on 9 October. It opens in the US on October 11 and anchors in UK cinemas just one week later. Stormy weather, troubled waters
2003	2004	The Coen brothers on losers, likability and Inside Llewyn Davis 	"or 30 years, Joel and Ethan Coen have been fond of failure. On trashing plans and turning hopes belly-up. On folks coming face to face with fate, then fate socking them round the chops and burying them alive in their own backyard. Thirty years in which the Coens themselves have been endlessly, remorselessly successful: showered with respect and love and awards. The morning after , they seem close to untouchable. Cannes has always had a thing for woe-bros (see also ) but right now the intensity of its crush makes you giddy.  , though, is another sad epic of dud luck. A Jenga tower of hard knocks that takes its hero (a folkie in 1961 Greenwich Village), piles pain upon pain upon him, then hangs him out to dry. Llewyn (Oscar Isaac) starts out homeless and bereaved and goes downhill from there. ""It's more interesting for me as an audience member to see a movie about a loser,"" says Ethan. ""Who wants to make a movie about Elvis, y'know? Or – well, it'd be a very different kind of movie."" Llewyn is the man who isn't Elvis, or, more accurately, the man who wasn't Bob Dylan (he's loosely based on ). He has talent but not genius. He needs either a lucky break or to accept defeat. His tragedy is to keep trying, even as his hunger is eaten away. It's not a movie nostalgic about the early days of an artist. ""Oh no,"" says Ethan. ""To not be starting out is fucking great. There's a lot of anxiety associated with that."" What about the worry of keeping it up? ""No, not really, I can't think of a lot of downsides. No, things get a little easier."" Joel, kind behind dolefulness, isn't sure: ""But they also get more like a job. When you're starting out the first time everything is new and stimulating. And that's the experience you're never going to recapture, so it's all downhill in a sense. You learn stuff, you mix it up, but it'll never not be a job."" And how does that make you feel? ""Well, not great. But I'm resigned to it."" Ethan chips in. ""There would be something sad about being old and still having to do that thing. But then there's something sad about everything. So: what the fuck!"" Talking to the Coens can feel like speaking to one polite hybrid brother, and, at other times, like talking to a whole host of them. Ethan – who does the bulk of the scriptwriting – turns out to have a habit of conducting conversations, back and forth, within his own answers. At 56, he's the younger and reedier, voice amiably strained, posture slightly similar. Joel, 59, long and lugubrious, sounds like a clarinet and acts like a sax. They reply in sync, a united front. Even subconsciously, the presence of the other seems to police the hymn sheet. Yet in some ways Inside Llewyn Davis feels like nothing so much as a film – a movie one of them might make after the other had died, or, at least, they'd been irreparably separated. Its aesthetic is drenched in melancholy; film stock so washed-out that it feels as it it's grieving. The story is haunted by a ghost – Llewyn's former musical partner, Mike, who threw himself off a bridge (we never learn why) – leaving our hero struggling to reinvent himself as a solo act. But no, they say, it isn't a hymn to the creative collaboration. Yes, they liked the idea of a man who wasn't there, but that's not what they cared about. ""It was just more baggage for him to schlep around,"" says Ethan. ""Yeah,"" says Joel, ""we gave him a lot of crosses to bear."" Ethan continues: ""The movie is about how everything's hard for him. Why is it hard? Is it something in him? Yeah, partly, certainly. At least partly. Wholly? Partly? I dunno."" What makes Llewyn likable is his precarious mix of self-belief and self-loathing; a whipping boy resigned to polishing other people's ammo. People forever tell him he's an asshole; he chimes in with agreement. Says Ethan: ""We wanted a nice dick. We wanted that tension: kind of is, kind of isn't, kind of is …"" Joel: ""He's the guy who blows his top or speaks out of turn or says something really dickish, but then, three minutes later thinks to himself: I'm a dick for doing that. Some dicks are just not self-aware."" It's curious, I say, that artists only have a free pass to behave that way once they're successful. They nod. Then I wonder if Llewyn's scepticism about the folk scene – with all its phoney artisan stylings – was meant to reflect that of a modern audience. His songs hark back to the reign of Henry VIII, but his gaze is almost 21st-century. There's a pause and the temperature drops. Ethan bristles a bit. ""Through our eyes? Eeee-wy. Contemporary eyes? Our eyes? Is he? He has a kind of jaundiced eye, but in my mind that's just a kind of professional disdain for a lot of his colleagues, like a lot of real professionals have – do you know what I mean?"" Joel harmonises backup: ""He has a very particular taste; he thinks that the pop aspect of that song they sing in the studios is a little bit inane. But I don't see that as being anachronistic to the period."" In fact, Llewyn has more genuine empathy with the lyrics he's singing than many of his peers. He is a bona fide hobo, water streaming from his shoes. And, unlike the Irish folk quartet who take to the stage at the Gaslight club in immaculate fishermen's jerseys and warble about trawling, Llewyn was actually in the merchant navy.   Such eager devotion to authenticity, says Ethan, ""was a mark of that specific scene …  and the seriousness and piousness that went with it. I'm sure they did consider themselves folklorists trying to preserve a tradition. More than that specifically, it's kind of a hallmark of the period – against convention, not wanting to sell out, not wanting to be bourgeois."" These days, he continues: ""The whole authenticity versus compromise question just seems unasked. It isn't even an issue now, strangely."" And is that a good thing? ""I don't know. Is it?"" Probably not; it sounds bad. ""Maybe the question is: does it matter?"" Well, a bit. The reason the Coens suggest that some artists in that scene foundered while others became superstars is that they adhered rather than innovated. ""Bob Dylan came along and did different things,"" says Joel. ""He was vilified for it because he wasn't authentic, but in fact he did respect the folk traditions. He also felt free to do what he wanted with them."" The Coens kicked off their own career giving a , before larkily ruffling the feathers of a variety of genres. Lately, though, there has been a change. The comeuppance their characters face does not have to have a cause. Life is just like that. Llewyn's closest cousin is the hero of , whose descent into the abyss ended only in abrupt apocalypse. That film was their most biblical in terms of sheer misery (it was based on the Book of Job), and their most autobiographical in terms of setting (Jewish households in 60s Minnesota). Inside Llewyn Davis may unfold in a more apparently glam location, a little further east, but it has the same DNA, the same doomy drive. The same focus on psychological catastrophe, rather than violent assault. This, perhaps, is why the Coens needed to be pushing 60 before making it. It's a movie whose jaundice comes from its makers having spent three decades at the top of their trade, the scales well and truly fallen from their eyes. It romanticises neither the artist's vocation nor the realities of showbiz. In one scene near the start, Llewyn watches from the audience at the Gaslight as Jean (Carey Mulligan), with whom he's in love, performs a ballad with her husband, Jim (Justin Timberlake).  The club's manager joins him. ""That Jean,"" he says, taking a seat. ""I'd like to fuck her."" He later explains how a lot of the punters have coughed up following the same impulse. What the Coens care about is what star wattage actually amounts to, and who fixes the wiring behind it. Today, on top of the world, what animates them most is discussing early 60s venue loopholes – not needing a liquor licence for gigs on account of being able to pack the place with high-school kids; getting a cheaper cabaret licence so long as you don't have more than three performers on stage. ""And that's tailor-made for folk,"" says Joel, delighted. ""And, well, this group works better because they've got this cute girl – that's his theory – and they all want to come in and fuck her. Right?"" They both smile. Outside, Cannes continues. Within, the Coens keep cooking up beautiful movies to undercut it."
2006	2007	Under the Skin serves up Venice film festival's Marmite moment 	"If a Hollywood star falls down in the street and nobody knows she's a Hollywood star, how do we know she fell down at all? Under the Skin, the new film from British director Jonathan Glazer, gave a celebrity twist to an unanswerable riddle when it put a wig on the , sent her off into Glasgow city centre and filmed her performance with hidden cameras. ""It's an amazing scene where my character falls over,"" Johansson recalled, following the picture's first showing at the . ""We shot it on a street with the public, in about six or seven takes throughout the day, and the reactions were always different. Some people would stop and help, others would just look, and some took pictures on their camera-phones and then just carried on going. It was a very strange experience."" Under the Skin is the third British picture to play in this year's competition and provided the festival with its first genuine Marmite moment. Adapted from Michel Faber's 2001 novel, Glazer's film is a bizarre fable of lust and loneliness, casting 28-year-old Johansson as a vampire alien in search of fresh blood. Some saw it as a masterpiece, others as a bore. The film's closing credits played out to an accompaniment of booing. The film-makers explained that they had used prototype cameras in order to shoot portions of the drama covertly in Glasgow's nightclubs and shopping centres. ""It was important that we were part of the environment we were looking at,"" said Johansson. ""So we blurred the lines between reality and fantasy. Such is life. That's the way we interact with each-other anyway."" Under the Skin is only Glazer's third picture in 13 years, following 2000's acclaimed Sexy Beast and his unloved 2004 thriller Birth. He admitted that his idiosyncratic style risks being divisive. ""I always enjoy film-making as a personal pursuit and I like to push the form as much as I can,"" he said. ""I wanted to find a visual language to tell this story in an unexpected way and to follow the alien's journey from id to 'it' to 'she'. So I suppose it's experimental for that reason, but not for its own sake."" After shooting in the city centre, the production moved on to locations in the Scottish Highlands. Johansson conceded it had been an arduous shoot. ""The forest was hell,"" she said. ""It was cold and wet and terrifying. It was like Scotland was trying to spew us out."""
2007	2008	The Zero Theorem: Venice 2013 - first look review 	"he Zero Theorem casts Christoph Waltz as Qohen Leth, an egghead data processor who is given a mission to make order out of chaos. This being a production by Terry Gilliam – the rambling mad uncle of British cinema – Qohen Leth is clearly screwed from the outset. is a sagging bag of half-cooked ideas, a dystopian thriller with runaway dysentery, a film that wears its metaphorical trousers around its metaphorical ankles. In fits and starts, I quite enjoyed it. The plot (by Pat Rushin) blunders merrily between the trite and the tangled as Qohan holes up in his big old house, tapping maniacally at his keyboard to make the numbers add up. But the theorem is unprovable, and the walls are closing in, and the sense of airless claustrophobia is partly a result of budgetary constraints and partly the director's own junk-shop aesthetic. Here is a man who cannot see a movie interior without festooning it with lightbulbs and candles, religious artefacts and antique telephones. On the few occasions when Qohan is permitted outside (either physically or virtually), the clutter goes with him. The director rifles through his contacts book and calls in some favours to find room for (as a rapping psychiatrist), Ben Whishaw (corporate factotum) and Mélanie Thierry (sexy spy). In the meantime, Matt Damon crops up fitfully as the malign ""management"", sporting a succession of camouflage suits that make him blend into the curtains. Even Damon is almost lost amid the rummage sale of The Zero Theorem. For all that, the film has a ragged charm, a Tiggerish bounce, and a certain sweet melancholy that bubbles up near the end. It is a wilfully iconoclastic film from a wilfully iconoclastic man. And it shows, for better or worse, that Gilliam is still in the game and eyeing the prize, despite his spectacularly ill-starred recent career. At the age of 72, Gilliam obviously retains an enormous capacity for hope. In this respect, he's a little like Qohan, who sits waiting for a phone call that will definitively explain the meaning of life. Of course, there's no phone call; it's all a delusion. Yet still he sits, because there's hope in the waiting and what else is the point?"
2027	2028	Irrfan Khan: 'I object to the term Bollywood' 	"haracter actors, we are routinely told, are usually the sort with ""interesting"" looks. The kind directors wouldn't hang a blockbuster on the cheekbones of, but would, say, use for depth, flavour, grit – every creative euphemism that conveys ""solid acting, shame about the face"". At 48, Irrfan Khan is a character-acting veteran. Considered too for Bollywood leads and, too little-known and Indian for Hollywood's, Khan has perfected the art of being . Since his breakthrough in Asif Kapadia's in 2001, right up to Ang Lee's award-magnet just over a decade later, Khan has built up the steady level of kudos that comes from being a serious, dependable actor. It's a shock, then, when he emerges from the hotel lift, the elevator ping cheesily announcing his megawatt smile. Khan is, in fact, Blue Steel good-looking. True, he's just swallowed up half of our allotted interview time to be preened by hair and makeup, but he is head-turningly handsome: tall, lean, raffish, chiselled. In the flesh, there's none of the world-weariness characterised in the dozen or so cops he's played on the screen, or the creepy intensity that makes him a great villain. The second surprise is that he's funny – in a dry, deadpan way that is all about the delivery. ""You're an entertainment writer, then?"" he says by way of introductory small talk. ""It's culture, really,"" comes my prissy mumble. ""Ah, yes, culture. Hmm. Which isn't entertaining at all, is it?"" And we're off. Once inside Benihana's, a heritage sushi chain briefly fashionable sometime in the mid-60s, Khan makes polite chit-chat about the and why he's keen to promote it (although, curiously, there is no major screening of his new film, D-Day, within it). He is here for the season's flagship event: a masterclass at the BFI with Asif Kapadia, the director Khan gratefully credits for saving his career when, in the late 90s, he was considering quitting. ""I came into this industry to tell stories and do cinema and I was stuck in television."" Which, on the Zee and Star Plus networks in South Asia, meant soap operas ""chasing middle-class housewives and the [poor and illiterate]. Once, they didn't even pay me because they thought my acting was so bad."" Then and Khan had suddenly bagged an acclaimed feature-film role. And a lead at that. ""Asif and I have been longing to work together again since then. I've been watching his last film [Senna]. There was a pirated DVD version in I could have watched but I thought, 'No, I want to watch it on a proper screen.'"" He builds up the importance of really saving it, to appreciate Kapadia's Bafta-winner as intended. ""I did eventually see it on a screen. A kind of tiny screen."" Where? ""Oh, on an airplane."" And there's the humour, teasing throughout the edges of our chat. Khan was born to Muslim parents in the Jaipur village of Tonk. His mother's side has royal lineage and his father's side was well-to-do, but Khan Sr was a self-made man. ""He had a tyre shop but, really, he was a hunter."" Khan, the eldest of two brothers and one sister, side-stepped the family business when his father died and escaped to drama school. ""First, I pursued cricket, then I tried business, but I quickly got bored. Cut, cut, cut to drama school. No one could have imagined I would be an actor, I was so shy. So thin. But the desire was so intense, I thought I'd suffocate if I didn't get admission."" Three decades later and he is no less passionate. Danny Boyle described his performance in as , and the late Roger Ebert commended him for in Mira Nair's . Mostly, though, Khan morphs on screen. He seems to disappear into the role, his face almost unrecognisable from one picture to the next: getting older and then younger-looking – blandly indistinctive at one turn, with sharp, penetrating features the next. Given his reputation for integrity, for being all about the craft (and he talks, at length, in those terms), it almost seems churlish to ask him about vanity and whether he's had work done. Almost. ""I've never looked to create an image where people fall in love with my face or style. It does cross my mind. But I've been trying to create a space for myself where I don't depend on that."" He is similarly vague about the beauty ideal in Bollywood – where he is arguably boxed into particular roles because the predominant aesthetic of the past two decades has been body buffed, skin-bleached. Even once-darker megastars – Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Preity Zinta – have . As a darker, slighter actor, is there pressure to conform to the industry ideal? ""I did try to do it but it made me feel empty. I cannot do things which don't come naturally to me. Initially, I did try everything. But you have to stick to your convictions and stand by your plus points. [Going to the gym] is not exciting for me. I want to connect with a story and hit [audiences] in the heart with a different way."" It's perhaps this attitude and a distinct lack of baggage – ""I don't have an image to protect"" – that explains why he, rather than much bigger domestic stars including Anil Kapoor or Amitabh Bachchan, has cracked both domestic and international markets. In the west, he has become the go-to Indian, bit-parting his way through Darjeeling Limited, A Mighty Heart, HBO series In Treatment and The Amazing Spider-Man. Meanwhile, Mira Nair has made him something of a muse: she was the first to spot his talent and plucked him from the National School of Drama (NSD) in Delhi for Salaam Bombay in 1988. Khan's part ended up on the cutting-room floor but the pair reunited on The Namesake in 2006 and for Nair's segment in New York, I Love You. In Bollywood, his career has stealthily progressed over dozens of films. ""I always object to the word Bollywood,"" he explains, delicately picking over his sushi. ""I don't think it's fair to have that name. Because that industry has its own technique, its own way of making films that has nothing to do with aping Hollywood. It originates in Parsi theatre."" So what defines Indian cinema? ""Celebration, [we] celebrate everything and Indian cinema is an extension of that, so why did they lose their identity by calling it Bollywood?"" What about the indie Indian cinema scene – the ""Hindies""? The sorts of films programmed in the London Indian film festival are feted and , but how do they play at home? ""They are doing great! That's why the industry is changing, because those films are bringing in money and they can't ignore it. Everybody's watching them."" Admirably, Khan and his wife, writer Sutapa Sikdar, whom he first met in his NSD days, are setting up a production company to support the films he says are bringing back the creative spirit and experimentation of India's . ""I wouldn't call [the Hindie films] arthouse but they do have a more original voice. You still have to entertain [Indian audiences], you cannot make them think. Or, you cannot leave them thinking. If you leave them thinking, you have to give them catharsis."" I warn him this could sound grotesquely patronising in print. ""But that is the way it is in India, they want an emotional connection. If you see a dark film that disturbs you, India won't take it. If it is tragedy, they will love it. They love to cry. That's for me, also. The first thing I do when I read a script is to find what hits me emotionally. That's what I connect to."" His harshest critics, he says, are his two sons. Not quite teenagers yet, but savvy enough to be telling him ""what works and doesn't work for them. There is no bias. And they're my sons."" His mother is proud, though he suspects she'd be happier if he gave it all up and became a teacher in his home town, as he once promised. ""My mum is a conventional Muslim. Things I have learned from Islam are fantastic and I will carry them all my life but I am more open. I feel healthier that way."" All in all, he seems pretty happy with his lot. Content and relaxed in a way that doesn't often come across with actors, no matter how successful. ""Yes! I don't know why I get such cynical headlines. They always make me sound like I'm suffering from life."" A car arrives to whisk him to the BBC and our 30-minute lunch is up. Khan puts his sunglasses on and taps out a cigarette. ""I have lost the temptation for things that come through stardom. One day I'd like to enjoy my life without fame. Now ... I enjoy it, you know?"""
2036	2037	Film review: Vicky Cristina Barcelona 	"oody Allen has long outlived his 1970s-80s heyday: outlived it too long, sadly, ever to recover his elusive comedy mojo, which depended on being jazzily in tune with the times. But his residual flair and extraordinary productivity mean he is more than capable of making a perfectly watchable little movie once in a while - and this is one: slight, disposable but entertaining. is an awful lot better than anything in his thankfully short ""British"" period. It's got just one really big laugh, right at the end, concerning a bullet wound. That's one big laugh, however, more than most new comedies. The title refers to its three characters: Vicky is an earnest, cerebral young woman played by Britain's Rebecca Hall with the pitch-perfect American accent that the new generation of Brit professionals has mastered. She is working on her ""Master's degree in Catalan culture"" and, leaving a well-off fiance behind in New York, is spending the summer in Spain with her friend, the rumpled and sexually adventurous blonde Cristina, played by . The third character is the city of Barcelona itself, whose architecture and cuisine are sunnily photographed as if for some tourist promotion. But all three are effortlessly upstaged by Penélope Cruz, playing Maria Elena, the passionate and crazy ex-wife of a moody Picasso-ish artist called Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem). He seduces both the Americans, and even engineers some PG-certificate girl-on-girl action between Cristina and Maria Elena herself. With all films that don't feature the Master himself in an acting role, the first question has to be: who is playing Woody? The answer here, oddly, is Rebecca Hall, in whom the mannerisms and tics are diluted but recognisable. Elsewhere, other Allen trademarks are visible. There are serendipitous encounters in the street. There are liberal sympathetic characters who are nonetheless rich and patrician enough for servants to be glimpsed serving lunch. Allen decides that Cristina's artistic bent, like Annie Hall's so long ago, should be for photography, and tellingly makes her forgo digital cameras in favour of old-fashioned film. And Vicky and Cristina speak in that distinctive indulgent conversational babble, sweetly poised by Allen on the laugh-at/laugh-with borderline. But Cruz, and to a lesser extent Bardem, utterly blow the Americans away. Cruz looks as if she has wandered in from a more hefty film entirely; everything she does and says seems to mean more, count for more. This isn't to say that she gets bigger laughs, or perhaps any laughs, but she certainly walks off with the film. Both the Spanish players have an easy presence and forthright energy, in comparison with which Hall and Johansson are slightly subdued and off the beat. All perfectly enjoyable. What's not to quite like?"
2062	2063	Carrie - first look review 	 Carrie White's terrible prom and its violent conclusion are so indelible in pop culture they no longer count as spoilers; the latest take on the story has her bloodstained dress and crazed eyes . But instead of taking pleasure in toying with and subverting a pop culture icon, Kimberly Peirce's new adaptation of Carrie is surprisingly slavish to . Touches of wit and insight enliven the first half, but Carrie eventually devolves into lackluster modern horror cliches for a souped-up version of the famous finale. As the sheltered and abused Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz is an enormous and sometimes welcome change from Sissy Spacek, though she's cringingly unbelievable in the key early scene where Carrie gets her period in the school gym. She's pelted with tampons and the video is put on YouTube, an indignity Spacek's Carrie couldn't have imagined, but the end result is the same – the combination of trauma and coming of age unlocks telekinetic powers Carrie cannot explain. Her mother Margaret, a religious fundamentalist played by Julianne Moore in a fright wig, thinks it's the devil. Carrie, armed with Google and the school library, realises it makes her special. Her near-erotic excitement in realising her powers sets Moretz's apart from Spacek's, taking nice advantage of the young actor's flinty talents. After the shower incident a kindly gym teacher (Judy Greer) and sympathetic classmate (Gabriella Wilde) both take pity on Carrie, the former offering makeup advice and the latter her boyfriend Tommy (Ansel Elgort) as a prom date. But the meanest mean girl Chris (Portia Doubleday) still wants her revenge, and concocts a plan with her slimy boyfriend (Alex Russell) to execute what's still cinema history's most humiliating prom queen coronation. Peirce's Carrie is drenched in blood in much subtler and more interesting ways than that prom dress, from sudden stigmata that appears on the Christ figurine in Carrie's room to the wounds Margaret inflicts on herself in moments of stress. The film opens with Margaret giving birth to the daughter she thought was cancer; the blood in that scene, and Margaret's initial violent reaction, is the most thematically rich and visceral scene in the whole thing – blood once united the mother and daughter, and more blood will divide them. But none of that translates in the big prom scene, and as impressively gross and scary as Carrie looks covered in pig's blood, she's no longer a traumatized teenage girl, but a stock horror movie character bent on revenge. It is accurate to call this Carrie a new adaptation of the original novel, but it is much more honest to call it a remake of De Palma's film. Until its bigger, more aggressive and much more generic finale the new Carrie has almost identical DNA to the 1976 version, from camera angles to line readings to the decor in the Whites' house. As different as Moretz's performance is from Spacek's she often seems to be mimicking her predecessor, and Moore has offered a complete re-do of Piper Laurie's Margaret, complete with nightmarish hair. Peirce only really gets to flex her directorial muscles in the over-boiled finale, and even then it seems to be in the service of the movie's true mandate: cashing in on name recognition for a modern audience of teenagers who only know Carrie as a demon in a prom dress.
2075	2076	Oscar nominations 2012: the fallout begins 	"Less than 24 hours after this year's Oscars nominations were announced by actor Jennifer Lawrence in Los Angeles, an extended round of soul-searching, navel-gazing and outright angst surrounded notable such as , and . The recriminations began almost as soon as Lawrence stepped off stage at the Samuel Goldwyn theatre in Beverly Hills. Drive's , seen as a frontrunner for the best supporting actor gong, to berate the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences following his surprise omission from the nominations, writing: ""And to the Academy: You don't like me. You really don't like me."" He added: ""Looking forward to the State of the Union tonight. Hope the new Axis of Evil includes Hollywood."" Meanwhile, Michael Fassbender's snub in the best actor category for Shame was flagged up by BBCFilm2012, and Tilda Swinton's best actress omission for We Need to Talk About Kevin also raised more than a few eyebrows. Rolling Stone film critic tweeted: ""Oscar snubs Albert Brooks/Drive. Ditto Fassbender for Shame, Shannon for Take Shelter & Swinton for Kevin. A new definition for ignorance."" Young Adult's was clearly hoping for a best supporting actor nod after picking up plaudits from critics in the run up to Tuesday's announcement. He tweeted: ""Join me for a drink at The Drawing Room, @AlbertBrooks? Me and [Andy] Serkis have been here since 6am."" Twentieth Century Fox had mounted an expensive but ultimately fruitless campaign for Serkis to be rewarded with a best supporting actor nod for his motion-capture turn as Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Another film that relied heavily on the technology was Tintin, which failed to pick up expected nominations for best animation and best visual effects. ""The visual effects branch didn't recognise it, because they thought it was animation, and the animation branch didn't recognise it because it was using performance capture and visual effects techniques,"" said Joe Letteri of New Zealand firm , which worked on the Steven Spielberg film. ""That was a really big oversight."" But there were also positives. Moneyball's best supporting actor nominee Jonah Hill said his awards success had convinced him to shift his career emphasis from comic acting to more dramatic fare. ""I came out in comedies when I was first introduced to people, and very few people, like Tom Hanks and Robin Williams, have been able to transition,"" he said. ""To have this kind of recognition – it means I should do more dramas. I don't know if there could be a bigger sign."" Meanwhile, producers of multi-nominated films such as The Artist and Hugo were hoping to capitalise on their newfound renown with an expanded presence in cinemas. The Artist, Michel Hazanavicius's black and white tribute to the silent era, may benefit most from its 10 nominations since it has not yet played in a large number of cinemas. Surprise best film nominee, the post-9/11 drama Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, and Alexander Payne's The Descendants may also improve their box office dramatically following worldwide exposure. Martin Scorsese's 3D fantasy Hugo, which took the highest number of nominations (11), is also set to expand at US theatres. ""I'm hoping that more people will perk up and discover the film,"" . ""We came out at a very competitive time, and I'm really hoping Hugo will grow again."" Industry site signalled the potential for Oscar-nominated films to benefit from their newfound recognition when it tweeted: ""Out of the nine Best Picture nominees, The Help is the only one that has so far made over $100m."""
2078	2079	José Mourinho hits back at his critics after Chelsea thrash Arsenal 	"José Mourinho has rarely looked so enthused since his return to English football. The manager had watched his team hassle, harass and humiliate local rivals and direct contenders for the title and his delight at the substitute Mohamed Salah's immediate reward on springing from the bench provoked a far more manic celebration even than usual. The Portuguese's brisk departure down the tunnel with normal time still ticking down was apparently born of a desire to telephone his wife with news of the result. When a victory resonates this momentously, such urgency seems more justified. That the leaders had reserved their most brutally emphatic display of Mourinho's stewardship – new or old – for Arsène Wenger's 1,000th game in charge of will, privately, have left him gratified, though the victorious team could delight more in their own strengths than their rivals' shortcomings. The temptation is there to suggest this contest was warped by Kieran Gibbs' dismissal on the quarter-hour, a case of mistaken identity that should have seen Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sent off instead if his deliberate handball from Eden Hazard's attempt was to be considered a denial of a clear goal-scoring opportunity. But in truth the ball looked to be going wide and the game was already over by then. The hosts had swarmed their visitors from the outset. The lead stood at two goals before Andre Marriner's errant judgment. For all that Arsenal were timid, Chelsea were merciless. Rarely have they torn into opponents this feverishly this season, the manner in which André Schürrle dispossessed Oxlade-Chamberlain and Nemanja Matic robbed Santi Cazorla in the build-up to the opening goals reflecting the sheer suffocation afforded the visitors. ""We were angry after what happened at Aston Villa the previous week with the two red cards,"" said Schürrle. ""That was motivation for us to be stronger."" This display rang out as a statement of intent that should not be diluted by the thrashings implemented by Liverpool and Manchester City later on Saturday against teams below the relegation line. Mourinho had never previously seen his Chelsea side win a league game by more than four clear goals, a tally they had already rattled up by the break as Arsenal wilted, the wind knocked out of their feeble challenge by the ferocity of the home side's opening. There was a time where the Portuguese would be expected to tighten up with defensive replacements once a comfortable lead had been established, settling for a clean sheet and straightforward victory en route. ""This is a funny story because I have the record of goals in the Spanish league, the record of goals in the Italian league, the record of points in every league I was in,"" Mourinho said, his hackles raised by the implication his teams have taken pride in solidity as much as pizzazz in the past. ""I had players winning gold boots and being the top scorer in the country, even in Europe. I really don't understand where it comes from. If you say my teams have a lot of clean sheets, I say yes. But a lot of clean sheets doesn't mean you are a defensive team. It means you defend well. ""If one day my team is really defensive, doesn't play football and my team doesn't score goals, I think it is fair to say my team is a defensive team. But when the numbers are there, and not just the numbers but the way you play football… Some coaches have the stamp for attacking football, but why? Look at the numbers."" Only Liverpool and Manchester City have scored more this term, even if none can match Chelsea's stingy record of 23 goals shipped in 31 games. The top 10 have all been defeated at Stamford Bridge, where the manager is now unbeaten in 76 matches. These, rather than a first win in 11 matches against the Portuguese to mark Wenger's 1,000, were the figures thrown up by this rout. Inevitably the focus was drawn to the home side's forward-thinkers, the sight of Samuel Eto'o and Schürrle scoring into the same corner, of Oscar recapturing the form of the autumn, Salah's first goal for the club, Fernando Torres' slippery running and Hazard's wondrous trickery. But it was still Matic who made them all tick. The Serb's is a powerful presence, closing down opponents and breaking up their rhythm while out of possession and progressive when he does claim the ball. The £21m outlay raised eyebrows, given he had been considered a makeweight two years previously, but he has added value to this set-up. He was everything Arsenal lacked in the middle: a physically imposing, calm and authoritative ball winner and distributor. ""He has added stability, not losing the ball but, at the same time, he is not the type of player who plays only square passes,"" added Mourinho. ""He can see the movement forward and the space. He recovers the ball but in a very clean way, not with fouls in dangerous positions, and he is still a young guy. We'd given the club two or three options on players [in January] and the most expensive was Matic but we thought his relationship between quality and price, and his potential for the future, would be better for us."" The owner went with the manager's input and Matic was restored as a Chelsea player. Back in 2010 he had been a youngster on the fringes, a wannabe playmaker seeking to make his mark, as he gained his first taste of English football as part of Chelsea's last title-winning team. If that feat is emulated, his addition will have been key. Nemanja Matic (Chelsea)"
2080	2081	Serial podcast: why is sponsor MailChimp getting so much attention? 	"t’s the cultural phenomenon everybody is talking about. It’s loved, it’s hated, it’s intriguing, it’s annoying and it’s genius. It’s … the advert. The 19-second ad is the first thing everyone hears at the beginning of Sarah Koenig’s podcast, and while the series is about a disturbing cold case high-school murder, the ad has grabbed everyone’s attention for its unintentional hilarity and charm. MailChimp was approached by Serial’s producers in June, off the back of their existing relationship with , Serial’s parent podcast. The ad consists of Dana Chivvis, the show’s producer, recording various people on the streets of New York saying the company’s name. It’s not exactly boundary-pushing. But listeners have become obsessed with one woman’s awkward butchering of the pronunciation of “chimp”, rendered as “kimp”. Or keemp? I just told a ""Mail Kimp"" joke to someone who doesn't listen to . It didn't go over well. Even Google is in on the joke. The company itself has even embraced the joke, registering the domain name mailkimp.com. There is even a fan “MailKimp” . MailChimp’s marketing director Mark DiCristina says this most popular element of the ad was not planned. “When the first episode aired, that was the first time we had heard the ads – so the girl who can’t pronounce [chimp] was totally spontaneous,” he AdWeek. (The jury is still out on whether laughing at a presumably non-native speaker’s pronunciation of chimp is acceptable or not.) The advert then ends with a very enthusiastic – and supposedly unscripted – remark from one of the people featured, who says she uses MailChimp and “loves it”. “I actually use MailChimp!” has become a across social media. Indeed, the advert has become such a hit that in the dedicated , one of the best bits is their sending-up of its sponsor. They even dedicated a whole episode to just the advert, . Some people are even joking that the girl who mispronounces chimp is the true murderer at the centre of the podcast’s investigation. MailChimp is an email marketing software company, founded in 2001. Originally the company was going to be called ChimpMail, but that name was (inexplicably) already taken. Its mascot is a chimp in a postman’s hat, and its tagline is the now ubiquitous command: “send better email”. MailChimp’s software allows users to “design, send and share newsletter templates”, and it integrates with Google Analytics so that users can monitor the performance of their newsletters. There are also subscriber profiles, and options to send automated mailouts to followers. Originally just paid-for, MailChimp later moved to a freemium model (users can sign up for free, but have to pay for certain features). The company boasts over 7 million business users – as referenced in the advert – and is used to send more than 500 million emails a day. The company’s pricing structure is based on three tiers: Entrepreneur, Growing Business and High Volume Sender. So it’s a pretty standard emailing marketing system. DiCristina maintains that the company’s sponsoring of Serial was not intended to boost profits, but to raise awareness of the service. “We haven’t really tried to understand whether it’s driving growth. Frankly, the idea is not for us to drive people from the ad to signing up for MailChimp. It’s more about creating awareness of this company,” he . And the company has succeeded. Engagement Labs that MailChimp has gained 6,891 Twitter followers since the beginning 3 October when the series began. The Guardian counts of the #MailKimp hashtag on Twitter since the premiere of the podcast. Amobee Brand Intelligence that 2,488 tweets have mentioned Serial and MailChimp together. The viral reaction to MailChimp’s ad has inspired and to advertise with the podcast. With the recent announcement that Serial will be given a second series, the company has confirmed it will continue to be a sponsor. But this sort of genuine, organic, viral reaction probably can’t be repeated, DiCristina admitted to . “I don’t know if we want to try to recreate the magic that happened with the ad. We’ll probably just want to do something completely different”, he said. "
2082	2083	What happens when you accidentally become internet famous? 	pls rt bc everyone needs alex from target on their tl This weekend, the internet made a Target employee famous. Currently known only as “Alex from Target”, all it took was for one person to tweet a picture of him. Within 12 hours, Alex was a top trending topic, had been written about on and had amassed a total of 274,000 followers on a Twitter account linked to him. He’s also gained a few fake accounts along the way. All this happened without anyone really knowing Alex’s full name, age or location. Yet, somehow, he now has a fandom of his own and is now getting the kind of attention saved for members of One Direction. One account reported to belong to him has tweeted the following: Am i famous now? Target has said they are in contact with Alex’s store and family, but no comment has been made beyond that. They added they were “proud to have a great team” and lent their support to their employee on Twitter. We heart Alex, too! Accidental internet fame can happen incredibly easily. You could be one tweet away from becoming the next meme. Usually, it happens to people who expect it the least. Sometimes this fame can be cruel and frightening. But sometimes it can open doors for other opportunities. What can you do in that situation? Here are three examples of people who know exactly how it feels to bear the brunt of accidental internet fame. , doge is a meme which became popular late in 2013. As with all memes, the concept is simple and a bit bonkers. It involves superimposing broken English in colourful Comic Sans over pictures of . It doesn’t make much sense, but it doesn’t have to. Doge managed to baffle mainstream media earlier this year when it was discussed on . It’s also morphed Welcome to the internet, where anything can happen. The unintended face of doge is a shiba inu called Kabosu, an adopted rescue dog living in Japan. Her owner Atsuko Sato is a teacher in Japan Kabosu, thought to be seven to eight years old, was abandoned along with several other dogs after an unscrupulous breeder went bankrupt. Most of the dogs were put down. Luckily for Kabosu, she was adopted by Sato in November 2008. The 51-year-old kindergarten teacher often posts pictures of her pets on her blog and its Facebook page, but had no idea of Kabosu’s unexpected internet fame until a fellow blogger alerted her in August 2013. And at first, she was a little afraid. She said: “I was stunned. “A photo from one of my blogs had wandered off by itself. It was more like a feeling of: ‘how could something like this have even happened?’ My thoughts weren’t at all that the meme was cute or interesting. “If I’m being honest, I felt frightened by the net.” And things got weirder when Kabosu became the face of DogeCoin. The currency hit the headlines after . But over time, Sato has come to see the meme as something more positive, as the number of Facebook fans from overseas increase and she gets more and more comments from people now inspired to adopt their own rescue dog. “It’s not just comments saying ‘Kabosu-chan is so cute!’, but also things like ‘I was worried about getting a rescue dog, but since I saw Kabosu-chan’s happy-looking face, I’ve started to want a dog from similar circumstances for myself’. “The thought I most want to convey on my blog is that ‘rescue dogs can be happy, and can become an important part of your family’. But I’m very happy that it’s not been just in Japan, but even overseas too.” “All of that is thanks to the meme. I am very grateful.” As with most popular things on the internet, Sato says she still can’t understand how it all happened. “I wasn’t sure about posting that picture to the blog because I thought she didn’t look cute in the picture,” she joked. “But it’s a good thing I did post it after all!” Not all internet fame starts out positively. Aspiring neurosurgeon Balpreet Kaur had no idea her picture had been posted on Reddit until she was told by one of her Facebook friends. The picture, taken without Kaur’s knowledge, was uploaded to the site’s r/funny subreddit under the headline The user was apparently confused that Kaur is a woman with facial hair. While many may have been upset at the situation, Kaur took a different approach and responded to the thread to explain her position as a baptised Sikh. In doing so, she turned the entire situation on its head, gaining the respect of redditors and shutting the internet bullies down with her calm and reasoned response. She wrote: “By transcending societal views of beauty, I believe that I can focus more on my actions. My attitude and thoughts and actions have more value in them than my body because I recognize that this body is just going to become ash in the end, so why fuss about it? “When I die, no one is going to remember what I looked like, heck, my kids will forget my voice, and slowly, all physical memory will fade away. “However, my impact and legacy will remain: and, by not focusing on the physical beauty, I have time to cultivate those inner virtues and hopefully, focus my life on creating change and progress for this world in any way I can.” Many people replied thanking her for teaching them more about her faith and many, including the original poster, apologised for any offensive remarks they wrote about her. , she said: I am well aware of how I am perceived by others: is she a man? A bearded woman? Transgendered? These perceptions find their roots both in simple curiosity and ignorance of the sheer diversity of the human race. I cannot stop people from forming convoluted first impressions based on what I look like, but I can stop them from turning that ignorance into misplaced assumptions or even hatred. This is why, having been alerted to the posting of the photo, I , and engaged with the posters discussing my appearance. What I learned from this experience is that building bridges between people isn’t really that hard: an honest conversation, a simple exchange of meaningful words that make up our lives, can change people’s opinions and change the world for the better – one step at a time. Fist clenched, a look of pure determination on his face, Success Kid is the boy who can do it all. You may have seen his face posted when someone’s particularly proud of an achievement. Success Kid’s real name is Sam Griner and the photo is one of many his mother Laney, a photographer, took of her son and posted She still remembers the day and the moment she snapped this picture. “He was so funny, crawling through the sand and then trying to eat fistfuls of it. He would move so quickly then, it was hard to snap shots of him sitting still,” she said. “I only got that one shot of him, and going through my camera on the drive home, I immediately loved it. I posted it to my Flickr account as soon as I got home, and it was an immediate hit. “It’s funny because so often people, usually those with little experience with toddlers, assume it’s a posed photo. Good luck trying to get a toddler to pose like that.” , but it wasn’t until two years later Griner began noticing it around the internet. Initially, someone had photoshopped a crying child in the background with the title “I hate sandcastles”. Griner admits: “I didn’t like it at all then. It was at the beginning of the whole meme thing. Sammy was still a baby and I didn’t even know what a meme was at that time, I just didn’t like him being portrayed as a bully.” Fortunately, a year later, the meme changed and Sam became Success Kid, which Griner says she thought was “just adorable”. This led to Sam starring in commercials for and in the US in commercials for Vitamin Water. And does Griner have any tips for parents whose children inadvertently become internet-famous? “Now it’s maybe a little different because memes and internet stardom is more widely known,” she said. “But still, it’s got to be a surprise for most anyone who finds themselves in this situation. I think the best thing to do is accept it, because once the internet has it, it’s really out of your control, for the most part. “Most importantly, retain the copyright to your photo, because the internet has now made it marketable. Not that you must now seek to market it, but it’s nice to have some control over how it’s used, and the right to take legal action over unauthorized use for commercial purposes.” As for Sam, who turned eight this year, Success Kid is something he’s grown up with and is fully-aware of. “It’s strange to think he’ll never remember a time he wasn’t. He mostly really likes it. We’ve only done a couple of appearances, so it’s mostly just the photo. He likes it and it sort of embarrasses him. “All of it is pretty awesome. Just that it happened to us. I took a photo of my kid at the beach, like any parent might, and posted for friends and family to see. Who could’ve ever known what would happen next. It’s been full of fun experiences and financially has helped quite a bit. I have no real complaints. I feel pretty fortunate.”
2085	2086	It's bobsleigh time: Jamaican team raises $25,000 in Dogecoin 	"A group of supporters has raised more than $25,000 in the internet currency Dogecoin to let the Jamaican bobsleigh team attend the Winter in Sochi. On Sunday, that the team had qualified for the Winter Olympics for the first time since 2002. The two-man sled will be piloted by Winston Watt, a 46-year-old Jamaican-American who also competed in 2002, with Marvin Dixon as the brakeman. But Watt revealed that, even after putting his own money up to fly the team to his training session, there wasn't enough money to send the two to Russia. As a result, he turned to donations, launching a PayPal account to pay for the estimated $40,000. The Jamaican bobsleigh team achieved international fame after qualifying for the 1988 Winter Olympics with a team of four men who had very little experience in the sport. That fame was boosted with the release of Cool Runnings in 1993, a loosely fictionalised account of their trials. The film remains a cult hit, and fans spread word of Watt's plight. One of them was Liam Butler, who runs the Dogecoin foundation along with the currency's initial creators Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus. Dogecoin is a crypto-currency, based on a combination of bitcoin, the popular digital money, and , the internet meme that superimposes broken English written in Comic Sans onto pictures of Shiba Inu dogs. ""As someone who grew up in the 90's, Cool Runnings was the ultimate feel good movie about underdogs out of their element achieving their dreams,"" Butler told the Guardian. ""When I was about 7 years old, my best friend and I had a billy-cart that his dad built. When we would start our run down his driveway, we would shout out the catchphrase from the movie: 'Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it's bobsled time!'"" On Monday in Sydney, where he lives, Butler launched Dogesled, aiming to raise some of the money required to send Watt and Dixon to Sochi. ""We started without a concrete plan in mind,"" Butler says. ""I sent a few emails out… but that was the extent of it."" Within a few hours, however, the fundraiser had collected just over 26m Dogecoins. So many people had been donating, in fact, that they seemed to raise the price of the currency itself; in 12 hours, the Dogecoin to exchange rate rose by 50%. ""Myself and Jackson Palmer (the creator of Dogecoin) were at a local pub trivia in Sydney when we noticed the value of Dogecoin had more than doubled since we'd last checked so we raced back to my house to ensure we could get the best price for the donations in a form the team could actually use. As much as we have faith in Dogecoin to become the community currency of the internet, we still understand that the team need to buy their airfares in a fiat currency."" At the exchange rate Butler secured, he has $25,000 ready to send to the bobsleigh team, and the donations continue to flood in. It looks like the Jamaican bobsleigh team might be going to Sochi.  "
2099	2100	Lady Thatcher's authorised biography sparks excitement and scepticism 	"The opening extracts of the long-awaited definitive authorised biography of focus on previously unknown youthful suitors, and details of her childhood. The two-volume biography by Charles Moore, former editor of the Daily Telegraph, is being serialised in that newspaper and – judging by the initial selections – will contain personal as well as political revelations. It also contains accounts of Thatcher's sister and how at school she almost killed some classmates in a scientific experiment that went wrong. The biography was conceived 16 years ago with some crucial conditions: it was to be published after the former prime minister's death, she would never read it and, importantly, the people who contributed their thoughts and memories knew that. She would never know what they said. Moore had full access to thousands of pages of Thatcher's private and government papers, early access to documents held back under the 30-year rule and extensive interviews with the woman herself. Not For Turning, the first of two volumes, will be published on Tuesday. ""There's a lot of excitement,"" said Jon Howells of Waterstones. ""People are expecting it to be pretty definitive."" The 800-page book takes readers through her early years and into her first term as prime minister, ending at the October 1982 Downing Street dinner celebrating victory in the Falklands. The way the book was produced is unprecedented. Thatcher approached Moore in 1997 offering access to herself and her papers, and ruled that it should not be published in her lifetime. In 1998, it was bought for Penguin – for a reported £750,000 – by its then managing director, Andrew Rosenheim, and from then it has incubated, the first volume written and ready to be published once she died. Stuart Proffitt, a publishing director at the Penguin imprint Allen Lane, said he and his team have not worked on anything else in the last eight days. It went to the printers on Wednesday night, hours after her funeral, and will be available to buy on Tuesday – St George's Day. But will there be many revelations? Most certainly, said Proffitt. ""I edited the two volumes of her autobiography and worked closely with her on those in the early 1990s,"" he said. ""There is a huge amount that is new – the book now makes all other portraits of her look rather two-dimensional. ""Quite apart from the material that is new, it is an exceptional book: simply as a piece of biographical art, I think it is in the very front rank of political biographies of the past 50 years – a very impressive piece of work."" One big question, which cannot be answered until it has been read, is whether Moore, an ardent Thatcher supporter, was ever the right man to write objectively. Can someone so steeped in Tory politics be sufficiently detached? Certainly Moore, known in Private Eye as Lord Snooty, is as archetypal as they come. In his Who's Who entry he lists hunting as his sole recreation and once entertainingly wrote about the things he has never done: ""I have never eaten a product of McDonald's, drunk Coca-Cola, seen The Sound of Music, watched EastEnders or Coronation Street, worn a T-shirt (as an adult), or been to Disneyanything. I have never bought myself any equipment for playing music, or any musical record, CD or tape, never set a video, or attended a professional football, rugby or cricket match, never had a gin and tonic, sewn on a button, lain on a sunbed, carved a joint or changed a wheel."" After Eton and Cambridge, where his friends included Oliver Letwin and the Condé Nast president Nicholas Coleridge, Moore joined the Daily Telegraph aged 22 as political correspondent in the very year Thatcher came to power. Within two years he was writing leaders and in 1984, still in his 20s, he became editor of the Spectator. Moore returned to newspapers in 1990, editing the Sunday Telegraph from 1992 to 1995 and the Daily Telegraph for eight years until 2003, where he was highly regarded and well liked. Can he be objective? Even Ken Clarke sounded mildly dubious when both men were on BBC1's Question Time last week. The politician was commenting on how so many of the things being said on the Thatcher years were interpretive, at which point Moore interjected to say we would soon get ""history"" in the form of his book. ""The editor of the Daily Telegraph says his biography is going to be history,"" said Clarke. ""We shall see."" Proffitt hinted that some people might be surprised: ""He clearly admires her, but doesn't restrain himself from criticising her when he thinks it's the right thing to do, and the book is remarkably balanced in that respect."" Whatever the reaction the book seems certain to sell well. Priced at £30 – but also available for less, for example £19.20 on Amazon – the book has the second highest biography order from Waterstones this year (after Julian Barnes). Howells said the Thatcher effect had been felt on the day of her death when sales of her memoirs immediately went up 300% and by the weekend it was in the region of 800%. ""There is a big market. Political biographies can be tough and we all know horror stories about political biographies that have underachieved but with someone like Thatcher there has got to be massive interest."" Although the publishers use the American version, authorized not authorised – house style they say – the book will not be published in the US until May. Volume two, called Herself Alone, is still being completed."
2100	2101	Margaret Thatcher biography reveals passions across the years 	"If the opening salvoes of Charles Moore's authorised biography of prove a reliable guide, the former prime minister – who died two weeks ago – will emerge as a more calculating figure than previously realised – over her political ambitions, money and even the price of a handbag. But she will also appear more personally vulnerable, persistently more innocent about the ways of the world and guilty of a youthful grammatical weakness: the use of ""between you and I"". In a striking account of her well documented efforts to persuade her supposedly closest foreign ally, President Reagan, to support Britain's campaign against Argentina's Falklands invasion in 1982, Moore reveals that Thatcher's memoirs ""grossly understate"" her sense of betrayal at Washington's willingness to endorse the Peruvian peace plan to avoid taking sides. She was also shocked at what she felt was Reagan's cynical detachment from her own analysis: a fight for the principles of democratic self-determination they both claimed to cherish. ""When she came to write her memoirs, she decided not to mention it because of the sour taste it left: she wanted to give a more positive account of her relations with Reagan,"" writes Moore, who has enjoyed access to Thatcher's private and official papers – including letters – since 1997 as well as extensive interviews with her and her friends. The angry letter she wrote to Reagan about his betrayal had to be toned down because ""she did not dare"" send it. The Argentinian junta's rejection of the peace plan opened the way to a military reconquest of the islands (with Thatcher weeping at the end of her bed over news of British casualties). But her enforced acceptance of a weak compromise – ""out of desperation"" for tactical diplomatic reasons – left her with a ""bad conscience,"" that she glossed over in The Downing Street Years, according to Moore. In the first two serialised extracts from Not for Turning (Volume I, to be published on Tuesday, Allen Lane, £30) in this weekend's Daily and Sunday Telegraphs – Moore is a former editor of both newspapers – a parallel can be drawn with young Margaret Roberts's first romance. It was a previously unknown (essentially chaste) relationship with Tony Bray whom she met through Tory student politics at Oxford in late 1944. She attached more significance to the relationship than he did and even took him home to meet her family in Grantham – but when he joined the army in occupied Germany he decided to let it fizzle out. It wasn't that her family was too poor, it was too serious, Bray told Moore from the nursing home where he now lives. But he kept the Palgrave's Golden Treasury of poems she gave him until he lost it in the 1980s. In the battle of the posthumous biographies, former Thatcher speech-writer and researcher Robin Harris is publishing a book whose title includes the same ""Not for Turning"" tag (Bantam Press, £20). Moore was quick to assert his authority by contradicting ex-Telegraph colleague Harris's claim in last week's Daily Mail serialisation that she graduated from Oxford without ever having had any romantic interests. ""Neither obviously wifely, nor deeply maternal'' she appeared disinclined to marry at all, Harris asserts. Far from being a gold-digger, she planned to finance her own political career. That is not the picture Moore paints after reading her letters, many to her older, less ambitious sister Muriel – on whom she palmed off an early suitor, Essex farmer, William Cullen (they remained married for nearly 50 years). As with her Oxford balls and dinners with Tony Bray she notes what she ate and drank (""Moussec in case you don't know is a sparkling champagne"") as well as wore in the new, more sophisticated world she was experiencing for the first time. This time it was the boyfriend who was smitten. By now 24 and a Tory candidate, young Roberts had decided she would not be a farmer's wife (though she checked out the farm), but allowed Cullen to buy her ""a nice black calf handbag"" for £7.15p. "" I'll have to hang on with William for a while now!"" she said. As with her career as a cabinet minister under Edward Heath and her later decision to challenge him for the Tory leadership in 1975, Moore confirms there was calculation in her media availability and party strategy. He considers her victory was not simply a ""peasants' revolt"" of middle class activists. Many Tory grandees who would not normally have considered a woman leader ""rather took to her character"", especially her courage. By this time she was long married to a man she described to Muriel as ""a Major Thatcher (aged about 36, plenty of money) … not a very attractive creature, very reserved but quite nice.'' He was unpopular with his staff at Atlas Paints – ""far too belligerent in dealing with them and they naturally don't like it"" wrote his future wife. The marriage proved to be the linchpin, emotional as well as financial, to her glittering career. The Thatchers were comfortable middle class rather than rich and Margaret did kindnesses to the struggling divorcee who lived next door, as both biographers confirm she often did for individuals she knew. She and Denis split the household bills and as prime minister she never stopped saying: ""I had to make my curtains."" One hint of upwardly mobility that emerges from early family letters is her use of ""between you and I,"" sometimes known as ""the nob's pronoun"" because it is supposed to sound posher. As a cultivated Etonian, Moore knows ""between you and me"" is correct. When quoting her letters he cannot resist inserting a (sic) after encountering the error – which is common among upwardly mobile Labour politicians too. This article was amended on 22 April 2013. The publisher of Charles Moore's biography of Margaret Thatcher is Allen Lane, not Charles Allen."
2102	2103	Tony Benn's body to share parliament chapel honour with Thatcher 	"The Queen has given permission for Tony Benn to become the second politician in history – after – to rest in parliament's chapel of St Mary Undercroft on the eve of his funeral. It was granted after Black Rod wrote to the monarch asking whether it would be possible to award him the honour, given that the chapel is a ""royal peculiar"" – part of the royal estate. Although his highest role in government was cabinet minister, the privilege is being given to Benn because he is one of only two MPs to receive the freedom of the House of Commons in recognition of his service for half a century. The other was Edward Heath. The former MP, advocate of the left and anti-war campaigner, who died last week, aged 88, also placed a plaque in a cupboard of the crypt in memory of suffragette Emily Wilding Davison. A Benn family spokesperson said: ""At the suggestion of the Speaker of the House of Commons and by agreement with the Lords Speaker, Black Rod and the dean of Westminster Abbey, an approach was made by Black Rod to the palace for agreement that Mr Benn's body rest in the chapel of St Mary Undercroft on the night before his funeral. ""The family were deeply touched by the Speaker's suggestion and would like to thank all those who have made it possible for their father to spend his last night in parliament."" It is intended that the body be received at the chapel next Wednesday and remain there overnight so that MPs, peers and others working in the Palace of Westminster can visit to pay tribute to Benn, whose 16 election wins were the most achieved by any MP. It is almost certain that the funeral will take place at St Margaret's church, which is located between Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. Invitations are expected to be sent out in the coming days. A number of tickets will also be made available to the public. In line with her own wishes, Thatcher's coffin was placed in the chapel, which is located alongside the much grander Westminster Hall, a location for state funerals, and where a short service took place before her funeral last year."
2103	2104	Margaret Thatcher and Charles Moore: Maggie and me 	"hat can it be like being Charles Moore? Since 1997 he has been trying to get inside the head of , understand her personality, fathom why she was so loved, so hated. That was the year she appointed him as her authorised biographer, and gave him unlimited access to everyone and everything in her life, on condition that he wouldn't publish until after her death. So that's a good 17 years of Thinking About Thatcher. Thatcher for breakfast. Thatcher for lunch. Thatcher over port in the evening. And what can it be like for him being interviewed for the ? I had suggested doing an ""at home"" in Sussex, but he was chary about me describing the ""soft furnishings, stuffed lions illegally shot, etc"". And this is understandable, given that many readers will already, no doubt, see him as the devil's Boswell. To add big-game hunter to his litany of sins would be plain masochism. So we have opted instead to meet somewhere Thatchery: ""her table"" at the Goring Hotel in London, around the corner from her house in Chester Square. As we puff our napkins I ask him what effect she had on other diners when she ate here. ""On one occasion she got up to leave at the end and they all started clapping,"" he says. She told him she found it ""kind but embarrassing"", but he could tell she was secretly pleased. When researching his book, Moore could see from Margaret Roberts's student days onwards that she was conscious of the attention being paid to her. ""When she was talking about her first boyfriend taking her to an Oxford ball she said something like 'everyone fell silent and looked at me when I walked into the room.'"" That would be the ""pink uplift bra"", I say (she refers to one in a letter Moore quotes in the book). A clipped laugh at this. Then: ""Favourable attention from men was always noticed. There was an almost actressy side to her."" We discuss how some men, such as Alan Clark, went weak at the knees. ""Not all of course, because a significant minority of her colleagues were irritated and even bored by her style. Too in-your-face for a certain type of Tory. But the majority found her attractive, some sexually. There was also a sub-set who saw her as a gay icon."" Did Moore find her attractive? ""Only in the sense of enjoying her presence – she was, after all, older than my mother."" Part of the attraction seems to have been to do with her reputation as a political dominatrix. He recalls the first proper conversation he had with her. ""It was in 1985 and I attacked her about the new Irish agreement and got the terrifying stare. I liked her readiness to engage and whack you."" She whacked him on many occasions after that, during his formal and informal interviews with her. ""It would have been unfair to sit her down for a formal interview in the later years,"" he says. ""It would have bewildered her."" Instead they would come to lunch here and chat. ""She got terribly bad around the time Denis died in 2003, no doubt because he died."" He witnessed moments when she thought Denis was still alive? ""Yes, I did see that, yup."" I ask if sleep offers an escape from this business of thinking about her constantly, or whether the Iron Lady intrudes even upon his dreams. ""I have, um, met her in dreams, but I can't, er, remember specific ones,"" he says. ""They are more anxiety dreams about being late to meet her or, um, not getting the tape working."" For an articulate man, Moore ums and ers a lot. He is also prone to use Latin phrases without warning, or translation. And every so often he deploys a white smile, one as engaging as it is unexpected, given the solemnity of his long, undertaker's face. (He was obliged to have his ""English teeth"" whitened for the TV cameras before a book tour to America last year, and it seems to have given him a Colgate ring of confidence.) There is, nevertheless, something unworldly about him. He's a very English combination of self-effacement, drollery and dogmatism – a listed rectory in a suit and blue tie (unlike his more artistic brother, this paper's architecture critic, Rowan Moore). The drink he orders with his kedgeree, a spicy virgin mary, seems appropriate and reminds me of the criticism that his friend Auberon Waugh made of him, that he doesn't drink enough. Moore met his wife Caroline at Cambridge. She later became an English don, but gave it up to look after their two children, now grown up. When I ask if she gets jealous about there being three people in their marriage, he gives that Colgate smile. ""Well, luckily, they have very different personalities."" Present tense, note. ""And I can't imagine ever being married to someone like , so in that sense they are not in competition."" A few years back I bumped into Moore at a book launch and he told me he had just come from visiting Mrs T's dresses, which were in storage in Finchley. At the time I teased him that he was like Jimmy Savile, who used to keep his mother's clothes wrapped in cellophane in a wardrobe. (This was before comparing someone to Savile became actionable.) But I can see now that it is important for a biographer to make that tactile connection with his subject – to handle the things she handled. Did the dresses help him channel her? ""Yes I think so, and it's another reason why she is more interesting than a male politician. I didn't want to see Tony Blair's suits, as it were. Each of her garments mattered more, required more decision-making."" Moore was the original young fogey, having become a writer on the straight from university, and then editor of the at 27. Now, at 57, he seems almost old fogeyish, endearingly so. When I ask how his interview with FW de Klerk went, the one he had told me he would be conducting before our lunch, he looks a little sheepish and says he got his dates muddled up. To be fair, he doesn't have a PA, and he does have a lot of commitments, such as his constant round of speaking engagements (more than 100 in the past year), his appearances as the token Rightie on , and his bold and elegantly written columns for the and (which he also used to edit, before Maggie took over his life). The research he has undertaken for his epic biography has been nothing short of Stakhanovite. And it isn't over yet. The 800-page first volume is out in paperback this week, having become, when published in hardback after her funeral last April, a number-one bestseller (a prize-winning, critically acclaimed one, no less). Moore is now working on volume two, due out next year. I guess he has his ending for it now: that poignant funeral. Did he think there would be more protests than there were? ""My biggest fear was that the BBC's focus on the nasty people would keep the nice people away. If you thought there was going to be violent protest, you wouldn't bring your granny and your children. The streets were full, but they would have been fuller."" The service brought tears to his eyes. ""What I found moving was a sense of how far she had come, the grocer's daughter who ended up with the Queen standing beside her coffin."" I ask if he was taken aback by the animosity elsewhere, the ""Ding-dong! The witch is dead"" side of things. ""No, I wasn't surprised, actually."" Not even when Bob Crow said he hoped she would rot in hell? ""That I did find outrageous. [don't speak ill of the dead]. The BBC only wanted to hear from the minority who hated her, from the Galloways and the Crows, or the half-witted students in Brixton, or the miners from Yorkshire – not the miners from Derbyshire or Nottinghamshire, because they weren't Scargillites."" But wearing his journalist's hat, I say, he must admit that the depth of the hatred from those quarters is fascinating. ""Yes, I think in one respect she courted the hatred because when a trade unionist started foaming at the mouth she wanted to have the argument. She was temperamentally incapable of not having the argument. The other reason she inspired hatred was that she won, and kept winning, on an explicitly Conservative ideology. The Left could never forgive her for that."" He also puts the hatred down to misogyny. ""A lot of people, both women and men, really didn't want to be ruled by a bossy woman. There was a sort of shudder about it."" Cartoonists always portrayed her as looking either slightly mad or angry, I note, and depicted her as man. Did that help or hinder her? ""Help, but it was quite wrong to depict her as a pseudo man in trousers and tie."" I know what he means, but it nevertheless makes him sound like he has missed the joke, as she always did. He claims it's not true that she didn't have a sense of humour, by the way. ""She was quite witty and observant, but what she didn't understand were jokes with a set up and punchline."" When I suggest that she might have been a bit Aspergerish, he is careful in his response. ""She was a naturally serious person from a serious background. She was not a relaxed person. She liked humour in others, though, and considered it an attractive quality in Denis and . She was terrifying but not pompous, and she could be quite playful, quite cosy in a strange way."" We talk about how, if she were here with us now, there would be two police protection officers in the restaurant, because the IRA never withdrew its threat to kill her. The Brighton bomb will feature heavily in the next volume. I put it to him that the speech she made the morning after the bombing might have been her finest hour. She must have been traumatised, yet seemed calm and steely. ""She was good at carrying on in situations of high tension,"" Moore says, ""but she would crack later, as she did in church that Sunday."" When I read his book I was surprised by his descriptions of her weeping during the Falklands War. Contrary to stereotype, he thinks she had a strong gift of empathy, ""but only if she thought the cause was just, as with soldiers and sailors. Obviously there was much less empathy if the person came from the enemy."" When I try to draw him out on the subject of Charles Moore he folds his arms and starts almost hugging himself like someone in a padded cell. Terrible body language, I say. ""Yes well, I don't like talking about myself. I'd prefer to talk about her."" Presumably, being an Old Etonian is a big part of his identity, I suggest. ""I certainly think being well educated is a great advantage in life. It annoys me when people won't admit that they were well educated. The tragedy of English life is that there is a constant attack on the good institutions rather than attempts to improve the bad ones."" He's doing what he accuses Mrs T of always doing: deflecting personal questions by turning them into political ones. ""That's true,"" he says with a grin. ""I am doing that, yes."" Another of his friends, the satirist , once described him as moving in a world without friction, as if never having known heartbreak. Fair? ""You couldn't edit newspapers for 20 years and live in a frictionless world."" And heartbreak? Was Caroline his first love? ""Effectively yes, not my first girlfriend but first serious girlfriend."" He has never carved a roast, sewn a button or changed a tyre – sounds like he's a difficult man to live with. ""True, but we have slightly reversed the sex roles in that I write the thank you letters and remember what people's children are called, and who we had to dinner last time. Poor Caroline, she does all the DIY and the changing of the light bulbs."" I ask if he was joking about the stuffed lion. He was. But he does have a stuffed fox. ""It was road kill. Elegant. Not one of those angry, snarling ones."" Controversialist – and masochist? – that he is, Moore revels in defending foxhunting. He has also been a vocal opponent of gay marriage, appearing on the programme in the run-up to the same-sex marriage bill to warn that it would ""cause confusion"" – and asking in a column, after it was passed, ""if the law will eventually be changed to allow one to marry one's dog"". But in terms of which side he will come down on in an argument, he is not easy to second guess. So what can it be like being Charles Moore? As we order coffees at ""her table"" and ask for the bill, he tells me he has no idea why he was chosen as biographer over other right-wing thinkers and writers. But it is tempting to imagine that Maggie might have seen in him a kindred spirit, an iconoclast and mischief maker who enjoys playing up to a parodic version of himself. With obvious delight, for example, he says that he hasn't listened to a pop record since 1974 ""unless inadvertently, in a taxi"". People in morning coats and feathery hats arrive for a late lunch, no doubt straight from an investiture at nearby Buckingham Palace. He must have been offered a knighthood by now I'm guessing, like those other editors, Sir Max Hastings and Sir Peregrine Worsthorne. Has he done a Jon Snow and turned it down? ""I wouldn't say, I wouldn't, um, be pushed to say anything on that, er."" Besides, he already has a title bestowed by e: Lord Snooty. ""Lord Snooty is a very decent figure,"" he says with a flash of white teeth. ""In the early the ditty went 'Son of a duke but always pally/with his chums in Tin Pan Alley,' something like that. He was an early apostle of diversity."" I'll buy that line about Charles Moore/Lord Snooty being decent, and though I'm not sure he has many friends on the Left, for a foxhunting Old Etonian he doesn't seem to care much about class. It's another unexpected thing about him. The person with whom he had the most laughs in his life, he tells me, was the late Frank Johnson, a journalist who used to pride himself on being a working-class Tory. And let us not forget that his heroine came from Tin Pan Alley, or at least Grantham's equivalent, the grocer's shop. , Volume One"
2115	2116	Le Week-End – review 	"It should in theory be possible to make a movie about a couple who make a sentimental journey to Paris to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary, only to discover over 48 unforgettable hours that they are entirely content with each other. That isn't what happens in Le Week-End, written by and directed by Roger Michell. Lindsay Duncan and Jim Broadbent play Meg and Nick, two married almost-retirees who, in the autumn of their lives, have decided to award themselves a Eurostar trip to the world's most romantic city. As the action continues, the audience is likely to have the same relationship with the film as the main characters have with each other: sometimes exasperated, sometimes bored, often affectionate. It's funny in a hangdog way: lugubrious and downbeat, prickly and bloody-minded, contrived in its crises, and demonstrating the kind of unsentimentality that is actually a bit sentimental. It all creates the kind of gentle melancholy comedy after which you leave the cinema not sure quite how depressed you are supposed to be feeling. is about an interesting subject, a subject that is the elephant in the living room – or rather the elephant on the Saga holiday, the elephant on the grey-pound world cruise, the elephant thoughtfully sucking the Werther's Original – and that is the emotional and sexual lives of old or older people, who generally don't get to appear much on movies or television. Meg and Nick are finding that as they get older, mother nature has played a cruel trick on them. As well as the persistent twinges and pains and agonies of physical decay, they find that they are still poignantly interested in life, interested enough to yearn for more, and to be therefore intensely dissatisfied with themselves and with each other as time runs out, and to find they are still sufficiently compos mentis for this to be almost intolerably painful. The Paris trip has thrown it all into stark relief. As they glance at each other in their unfamiliar hotel room, seeing each other as if for the first time, it is as if fate has fixed them up on a blind date, kept them blind for three decades and then finally whipped off the blindfold to let each see the grumpy, sagging oldster they're stuck with. At one stage, Meg is astonished at some misjudged suggestion of Nick's: ""Don't you know me at all?"" This sudden disorientation or estrangement has a weirdly erotic side effect – which also has something to do with being in a sleek hotel room. Sex could well be on the agenda. And yet this subject, pleasurable though it is, raises the issue of Nick's toxic jealousy, itself a byproduct of his queasy self-doubt. Meg teaches in a secondary school and Nick is a philosophy lecturer at a new university: his academic position, it turns out, is rather precarious, owing to a faculty row – and here Kureishi may be influenced by the fictions of JM Coetzee and Philip Roth, although the dispute is not dwelt upon. As for Meg, her position is different, but the same miasma of discontent is overhead. Over the years, Nick has managed to suppress his disappointment with life, but his underachievement can't be ignored when the couple run into Morgan, amiably played by Jeff Goldblum: a media-star academic who was Nick's university contemporary and who once looked up to him as the greater mind: a charismatic hipster who loved Godard. Morgan roguishly flirts with Meg and invites the couple to the ritzy launch party for his latest shallow work of pop philosophy, an event that lights the blue touchpaper under the rocket of their marital despair. Could it be that what this weekend has revealed to the couple is how very much they basically dislike each other? And if that is the case, do they have the courage to act on this knowledge? Part of the couple's agony is that they are empty-nesters. They did not fully realise that they may face a long future post-children and post-work: things which had for so long been their reason for living. It is Nick especially who is afraid of being alone, but at the same time afraid of being alone with his wife: the reason, perhaps, why he had allowed their deadbeat son to live with them in the family home for so long. This is a return to a favourite topic of Kureishi's – intimacy – and for me the movie is a distant reminder of his 2001 film , directed by the late Patrice Chéreau. But along with this fear is a kind of jittery, defiant freedom and fun, a feeling that going for broke is now a real lifestyle option, maybe the only option. Duncan and Broadbent give warm and intelligent performances. In their faces you can see the ghosts of the kids Meg and Nick once were: stroppy, horny and happy."
2116	2117	BBC to pay Lord McAlpine £185,000 after false child abuse allegations 	"The BBC will pay £185,000 in damages to following the Newsnight broadcast on 2 November that wrongly linked the former Conservative party treasurer to historic allegations child sexual abuse. It is one of the largest sums ever paid out by the publicly funded corporation, which is on the losing end of six-figure libel cases infrequently, and will set a precedent for other legal actions the peer has in train against ITV and any other media organisations and individuals. The said it had ""agreed terms with Lord McAlpine to settle his claim of libel against the corporation. The settlement is comprehensive and reflects the gravity of the allegations that were wrongly made"". It is understood that, despite the payment, the BBC and McAlpine have reached an agreement in which will say he still holds the BBC ""in great esteem"" when statements are read out in open court confirming the damages. The concession was welcomed by the BBC as it battles to restore its reputation after the error, which led to the resignation of director general George Entwistle on Saturday. Despite the payout, McAlpine's lawyer said the peer was ""more than aware that the ultimate people who will be paying any monies that he may receive are in fact the licence payers, the people who really own the BBC"" and that any settlement ""reached is tempered in the light of that"". The highest amount paid by the BBC in recent years was £500,000 to African diamond firm Oryx Natural Resources after the broadcaster wrongly linked it to Osama bin Laden. Earlier on Thursday, McAlpine's lawyer Andrew Reid said ITV's This Morning was top of ""a very long list"" of those facing legal action from his client over false accusations in relation to child abuse. Also likely to be targeted is Sally Bercow, the wife of Speaker John Bercow, who tweeted the peer's name after the transmission of the programme, which did not reveal his name. Reid said he would have no choice but to sue if those on the list failed to come forward to apologise. Some people, including Guardian columnist George Monbiot, have already apologised to the peer in writing. Bercow had made an apology on Twitter, but Reid appeared not to be aware of this."
2117	2118	Margaret Thatcher obituary 	", who has died aged 87, was a political phenomenon. She was the first woman elected to lead a major western power; the longest serving British prime minister for 150 years; the most dominant and the most divisive force in British politics in the second half of the 20th century. She was also a global figure, a star in the US, a heroine in the former Soviet republics of central Europe, a point of reference for politicians in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. In Britain, the Thatcher years were a watershed. After them, the ideals of collective effort, full employment and a managed economy – all tarnished by the recurring crises of the 1970s – were discredited in the popular imagination. They were replaced with the politics of me and mine, deregulation of the markets and privatisation of the state's assets that echoed growing individual prosperity. Thatcher did not cause these changes, but she legitimised and embedded them. Her belief in the moral authority of the individual and the imperative of freedom of choice led left as well as right to reappraise the welfare state. Her perception of economics, society and Britain's place in the world continue to shape British politics. It is often claimed that she gave no warning of the revolution she was about to unleash when she won her first majority in 1979. In fact, although the official manifesto was opaque, her speeches in the years between defeating for the leadership of the Conservative party in 1975 and coming to power laid out the ideology that underpinned her policies over the next 11 years. Thatcher was pragmatic about her methods but constant in her targets: socialism, the Labour party and above all the collectivist state that Labour, abetted by one-nation postwar Conservatism, had constructed. She believed that the state was a burden on private enterprise. Its cost was crippling the economy and overloading it with debt. Vested interest had been allowed to flourish, most notably in the trade unions but also in the nationalised industries of coal, steel and telecommunications. Many others shared her analysis. The strength of her beliefs gave her the courage to push on where others might have conciliated. She came to ignore criticism with a ruthlessness that was in the end her undoing. She was not the only person who saw a world divided between good and evil. What marked her out was a willingness to say so, abroad as well as at home. Soviet leaders, after years of detente, were startled to find their regime denounced as the embodiment of inhumanity, bent on military expansion. Before she had won a general election vote in the UK, Thatcher had won the sobriquet overseas of the Iron Lady. Only an outsider could have given birth to an ideology as iconoclastic as Thatcherism, and Thatcher always regarded herself as a challenger of the status quo, a rebel leader against established power. What mattered to her was less the breadth of her support than the depth of her convictions. In time, there grew around her a mythology that rooted her absolute faith in the individual in her upbringing above the grocer's shop in the Lincolnshire town of Grantham. She was the second of two daughters of Alderman Alfred Roberts and his wife, Beatrice. The two girls were educated at Kesteven and Grantham girls' school, and at 17 Margaret won a place to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, where she was tutored by the future Nobel prizewinner Dorothy Hodgkin (with whom she remained on respectful terms, despite Hodgkin's passionate opposition to nuclear weapons). She graduated in 1947. Less than two years later she was selected to contest the hopeless Kent seat of Dartford, despite the reservations of some party activists who were appalled at the prospect of a 23-year-old woman as their candidate. She contested Dartford in both the 1950 and 1951 general elections. It was at a social function after her first adoption meeting that she met , a businessman with a passion for rugby who had earlier rejected the chance of fighting the seat himself. Denis drove the candidate back to London. Well-off, divorced and amiable, Denis ran his family paint firm, which was later absorbed into Burmah Oil. They were married in December 1951. In 1953, their twins, Mark and Carol, were born. Denis, it was claimed, spent the day at a cricket match – Carol later called their marriage ""a partnership of parallel lives"" – and while still in the maternity hospital, Margaret signed up to study for her bar finals. She was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1954. For a young woman with a new family, to become an MP was unprecedented. But in 1958, she was selected for the rock-solid north London constituency of Finchley, the seat she represented from October 1959 until she retired at the general election in 1992. In October 1961, after only 20 months on the backbenches, the then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, made Thatcher a junior pensions minister (a job she later gave to her own successor, John Major). It would be nearly 30 years before she returned to the backbenches. In 1967, with her party in opposition, she was promoted to the shadow cabinet by the new party leader, Heath, and when he won the election of June 1970, she became education secretary, the only woman in the cabinet. Here, her public reputation was made as ""Thatcher the milk-snatcher"", the minister who cut spending by ending universal free milk for primary school children. It was a defining moment, but also a rare breach of the Conservatives' unwillingness to disturb the postwar consensus. Much more in keeping was her continuation of Labour's plan to replace grammar schools with comprehensives. But she was at the ringside as Heath's experiments in monetarism and industrial relations legislation crashed and burned. Heath resumed the interventionist policies of the 1950s. In February 1974, as a miners' overtime ban prompted power cuts and the introduction of a three-day working week, Heath asked: ""Who governs Britain?"" He lost the general election. Thatcher later claimed she had always been uncomfortable with Heath's consensual approach. At the time, however, she was silent and loyal. However, after narrowly won a second election victory in October 1974, Thatcher was among the embryonic new right preparing to challenge Heath. Its intellectual leader was , but his chance of leading the party vanished with a notorious speech, claiming that the poor had too many children. Thatcher decided she would put her name forward for the contest. ""Someone who represents our viewpoint has to stand,"" she told Joseph. Denis told her she was out of her mind, a view echoed in every newspaper. To a party that could not decide whether it was worse to be female or to be suburban, she appeared entirely unelectable. Yet she defeated Heath in the first ballot and four other contenders in the second. The beaten favourites included , the man who was later her indispensable deputy. She won in an ambush that capitalised on discontent with Heath rather than positive enthusiasm for her. As a result, she was never sure of her party: ""Is he one of us?"" became the defining question of the next 11 years. Many of her backbench colleagues shared the prevailing view in the Labour government that Thatcher's leadership made the Tories unelectable. She worked assiduously to meet a barrage of criticism – criticisms that often focused as much on attributes of gender as on matters of policy. Her hair, her clothes and particularly her voice were attacked. Politics remained a largely male preserve, about the strength to confront, whether it was trade union power, economic crisis or Soviet threat. Thatcher's only cabinet-level experience had been in a relative backwater. She had always conformed to the norms of a woman in public life. Engaged in discourse largely with men, she observed the conventions, flirted, sometimes shouted and occasionally wept. Her advisers emphasised the feminine, softened her appearance and lowered her voice. Yet she was always most authentic when she was defiant. If a single phrase captured her political identity, it was from her 1980 party conference speech: ""This lady's not for turning."" She played by the rules that demanded that she present herself as soft and yielding, but by her diligent attention to detail, the concentration of her focus, and her appetite for conflict, ultimately she subverted them. Thatcher drew up a new settlement with the welfare state, and organised labour and the City in a way that rewarded enterprise and individual effort over the collective and the communitarian. She regarded group interests, from trade unions to the professions, as protectors of privilege. Although monetarism had already been forced upon the preceding Labour government by the International Monetary Fund, under Thatcher it was presented as a crusade, until it was discreetly abandoned in the mid-1980s.As the global slump reached its nadir in early 1981, she and her chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, defied all appeals for Keynesian-style reflation. In the first budget of the administration, VAT was nearly doubled to 15% while personal taxes were slashed – the top rate of income tax from 83% to 60%, and the standard rate from 33% to 30%. Over the next 10 years, the standard rate came down to 25%, and the top rate to 40%. Interest rates were to be the principal method of controlling the money supply. Removing exchange controls was the first symbolic piece of deregulation. In September 1982, unemployment – which became the de facto weapon against the trade unions – reached 3 million. A series of employment acts were introduced which ended trade unions' traditional show-of-hands votes and brought in secret pre-strike ballots as well as decennial votes on the political levy. Wages councils were constrained. In a second tranche of legislation in the late 1980s, the closed shop and secondary strike action were outlawed. Thatcher thought the government had no role to play in public sector pay negotiations or in seeking to secure industrial peace. The steelworkers were the first to clash, and although, in 1981, planned pit closures were aborted to avert a miners' strike, by early 1984 the government was prepared – literally – for what was to be the last stand of the old trade union movement in its heavy industry heartland: the year-long showdown with the miners that culminated in mass closures and ultimately privatisation. Thatcher shrugged off record personal unpopularity and relished facing down her critics. But she would not have survived without the crisis on the left which led to the formation of the breakaway Social Democratic party. In 1981 there were riots in Brixton, south London, Toxteth in Liverpool and Manchester's Moss Side. From March 1984, striking miners and police were in frequent, violent confrontation. In 1985 Brixton erupted again, and there was rioting too in the Handsworth area of Birmingham. In the same year PC Keith Blakelock was murdered during disturbances on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London. , which came to be a fundamental of the Thatcherite mission, was only hinted at in 1979, and in the depression of the early 1980s caution prevailed. When the ailing nationalised motor manufacturer British Leyland ran into trouble in early 1980, Joseph, then Thatcher's industry minister, bailed it out like a Heathite. Nonetheless, in 1980-81 more than £400m was raised from selling shares in companies such as Ferranti and Cable and Wireless. Later came North Sea oil (Britoil) and British Ports, and from late 1984 the major sales of British Telecom, British Gas and British Airways, culminating at the end of the decade in water and electricity. By this time these sales were raising more than £5bn a year. Conflict was at the heart of Thatcher's style. But it is a myth that she never ducked a challenge. Ever a pragmatist, she was astute in the fights she picked. The battles during her first term, from 1979 to 1983, ranged across a forbiddingly wide terrain and set the tone for the years to come. Not all of the challenges were sought: the IRA was behind many of them. In August 1979 Lord Mountbatten and 18 soldiers were murdered in separate attacks. In April 1980, she authorised the SAS to launch their live-on-TV rescue of 19 hostages from Iraqi-trained terrorists in the Iranian embassy siege. The following year, she refused to intervene to prevent the deaths of Bobby Sands and nine other republican hunger strikers in the Maze prison in Northern . The IRA's mainland bombing campaign that ensued added to the impression of a government under siege. Airey Neave, who had run Thatcher's leadership campaign, had been assassinated by the Irish National Liberation Army just before the 1979 election. She lost another intimate, , at the hands of the IRA 10 years later. On 12 October 1984 the Provisionals' campaign nearly claimed Thatcher herself. Five people died in the bombing of the Grand hotel during the Conservative party conference in Brighton. Others, including the cabinet ministers Norman Tebbit and John Wakeham, were seriously injured. The prime minister responded with resilience. Betraying no sign of shock, she delivered her speech to the conference later the same day, as planned. She was already negotiating with Dublin what was to become a year later the Anglo-Irish agreement, an attempt to improve security co-operation for which she faced down her Ulster Unionist friends and conceded the acceptance of an Irish dimension in the affairs of Northern Ireland. She did not seek a settlement, but with hindsight the agreement can be read as a major step in the peace process. The conflict with which she was most closely identified, and the one that arguably rescued her from being just a one-term wonder, was the Falklands war. On 2 April 1982, invaded the islands in the South Atlantic. Discussions about a leaseback and the removal of a naval patrol vessel had been misread as a sign that Britain was ready to abandon its distant colony. Thatcher, ignoring the initial advice given to her by much of her cabinet – and inspired by the First Sea Lord, – took the extraordinary risk of dispatching a taskforce to retake the islands. While negotiations for a peaceful outcome stuttered on through the US secretary of state, , the Royal Navy steamed south. On 21 May the British landed and on 14 June the Argentinians surrendered. Less than a year later, the Conservatives were returned with a majority of 144 over a divided opposition. Thatcher's years in office were bookended by two defining events of global significance. On Christmas Day 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Ten years later, the came down, heralding the collapse of the Soviet empire. The invasion of Afghanistan reinforced Thatcher's belief in the expansionist intent of the Soviet empire. She became the evangelist for America's ambition to upgrade its own and Nato's nuclear defences with Cruise and Pershing missiles. In 1980 she announced Cruise would come to Britain. As a result, the perimeter fence around the RAF base at Greenham Common, Berkshire, became the centre for a decade of anti-nuclear campaigning by women's groups. She negotiated to upgrade Britain's independent nuclear deterrent by acquiring Trident II, at a cost of £7.5bn. Yet for all the attention to hardware, Thatcher always believed its citizens would be the ones to destroy the Soviet empire. Visiting the Berlin Wall in 1982, she prophesied that it would be brought down by the ""anger and frustration of the people"". She promoted co-operation and fostered relations with Poland and Hungary, encouraging their leaders to imagine a world after communism. At the same time, she sought out modernisers in the Soviet Union and brought Mikhail Gorbachev, when he was still a relatively minor figure in the Politburo, to the attention of as a man ""to do business with"". She made a triumphant visit to Russia in 1987 where she was mobbed by the public and took the argument against communism direct to live television, ""as if she was fighting a byelection in Moscow North,"" this paper's correspondent wrote. If her subsequent reluctance to accept German reunification suggests her belief in the people was less deep-rooted than she would claim, she was a leading force in undermining the power of the Soviet Union. In her battle against communism, she marched in step with the US. She and Reagan were in particular sympathy (sorely tested when, in October 1983, the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, a Commonwealth member), although she disagreed strongly with his dream of major nuclear disarmament. That, she considered, was a threat to European security. The Westland affair early in 1986 marked the beginnings of Thatcher's break with Europe. She preferred to see the ailing British helicopter company merge with the American Sikorsky rather than accept the European solution that her defence secretary and leading critic, Michael Heseltine, had wanted. He resigned. In the ensuing row, Thatcher came close to being implicated in the deliberate discrediting of her rival. Her protege, the trade secretary Leon Brittan, was forced to resign. Her pro-Americanism was sealed in April 1986 by her support, alone in Europe, for the US bombing raid on Libya. Thatcher had originally been a supporter of Britain's membership of the Common Market and Labour's complete rejection of it after the successful referendum in 1975 only strengthened its appeal to her. However, she was elected in 1979 on a promise to seek a budget rebate, a preoccupation that dogged every summit for her first five years until she reluctantly agreed a settlement at Fontainebleau in 1984. A period of relative calm, during which Thatcher advocated speeding up the single market negotiations followed, until the passage of the Single European Act in 1987. At that point, she realised that her ideal of Europe as a trading partner, a market for British goods and services where remaining trade barriers would wither away, was at odds with the vision of closer political integration shared by the European commission president, Jacques Delors, and most other European nations. Her battles against it became one of the deadly fissures in her relations with her cabinet. It is one of the paradoxes of an era that will be remembered for its hostility to the EU that in the Single European Act (which led to the Maastricht treaty), Thatcher ceded more control over British affairs than any prime minister before, while in sponsoring the Channel tunnel, she established a permanent land route to the continent. In 1988, she made a speech in Bruges attacking ""creeping Euro-federalism"". Throughout the following year, her chancellor, Nigel Lawson, fought for a date for sterling to join the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), to which the UK was committed and which would allow interest rates to fall. Thatcher was determined that the value of the pound should not be pegged to European currencies. Protesting at the influence of the economist as a rival centre of advice, Lawson resigned. Thatcher's desire to build a free-market Europe was matched by her attempt to strengthen the role of the individual against the state at home. The election of June 1987 produced another landslide, her third election victory. It heralded a programme of radical public sector reform intended to assert the power of the consumer and bring market discipline into schools and hospitals. The 1988 Education Act brought in city technology colleges and grant-maintained schools, free of local authority control. Housing action trusts further limited local councils' room for manoeuvre. A purchaser-provider split was introduced into the NHS. The rhetoric of public spending cuts continued, although the records show that public spending rose every year in her time in office, declining only as a share of GDP. Local councils, particularly Ken Livingstone's Greater London council, were among Thatcher's most effective critics. Her response was the poll tax, properly known as the community charge, levied on an individual basis that would link council spending to local taxes. She ignored advice that such a tax would be impossible to collect and that it was also severely regressive. In March 1990 there were protests and riots in a mass rejection of an unjust tax. Meanwhile the party splits over Europe were reaching a climax. Geoffrey Howe, an early and loyal Thatcherite, had supported Lawson over Britain's membership of the ERM. Only the threat of their resignation had forced her to agree to join. In revenge, Howe was sacked as foreign secretary and made leader of the House and deputy prime minister. In October 1990, as Thatcher stood at the dispatch box after the Rome summit (where she had been ambushed with demands for further integration) dismissing, it seemed, any progress at all with ""No! No! No!"", Howe finally resolved to resign. The defiance that had once so impressed her party, and many in the country, now sounded dangerously deluded even to some of her closest supporters, especially those in marginal seats. It took less than 10 days – from 13 November when Howe made his resignation speech to 22 November when Thatcher announced her resignation – for Conservative MPs to eject her. At the 1992 election, Thatcher retired from the Commons and took a seat in the Lords. Powerfully affected by a sense of injustice, she found it hard to desert the field of domestic politics. Her only consolation was that in ensuring the accession for her favourite, Major, she denied it to Heseltine. But she was soon letting it be known that Major was not, after all, one of us. After his defeat in May 1997, his successors – with the exception of Iain Duncan Smith – were found to be disappointments too. The first of her two volumes of memoirs, The Downing Street Years, appeared in 1993, followed two years later by The Path to Power. She also established the Thatcher Foundation, which, funded by the large fees she could command for public speaking in the US and Japan, was intended to promote her ideas, not least in the emerging democracies of eastern Europe. In March 2002, after a series of minor strokes, she gave up public speaking. Thatcher broke the pattern of postwar politics and changed its nature. Labour accommodated rather than reversed her attack on the welfare state and left her employment legislation almost untouched. When the Conservatives finally returned to power in May 2010, in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron and shared her priorities and used her language. So complete, it seems, was her undermining of the role of the state that even the catastrophic failure of deregulated markets has yet to trigger a reappraisal. It is a paradox of her period in office that, while seeking to limit the scope of government, she introduced a style of command and control, top-down, centralised authority that strengthened it and has proved hard for her successors to resist. It has leaked into the way political parties are managed, so that they struggle to regenerate a spirit of local activism. Some of the most valuable institutions of civil society from the churches to the trade unions have been scarred by her attacks on collective enterprise. Denis, to whom Thatcher had awarded a baronetcy in her resignation honours, died in 2003. She is survived by Mark and Carol and her two grandchildren, Michael and Amanda.

2118	2119	Cannes 2013: The Selfish Giant – review 	"ritish film-maker Clio Barnard made a sensational debut with The Arbor in 2010, about the troubled dramatist Andrea Dunbar: a brilliant and eerily dreamlike film which won the passionate admiration of David Hare and David Thomson among many others. Actors recreated scenes from Dunbar's life and lip-synched into camera using tape-recorded testimony from Dunbar's friends and family. Now Barnard's intensely anticipated follow-up has arrived at Cannes, showing in the Director's Fortnight strand. It is a variation on a theme by Oscar Wilde, a new secular version of Wilde's children's tale , which challenges the audience to rethink how redemption is achieved in a world without Christ and which of its characters the title actually refers to. This film may not exactly have the sophistication of The Arbor, being a more straightforwardly social realist drama in the super-evolved ""Loach 3.0"" style of Andrea Arnold or Lynne Ramsay: beautifully photographed and intensely considered and controlled, with urban pastoral landscapes of deprivation transfigured into beauty. ) But any conceivable disappointment that The Selfish Giant is not as formally distinctive as The Arbor is soon swept away. Barnard's storytelling is heartfelt and passionate, fluent and supremely confident and this is a heart-wrenching movie with some stunning set pieces. Arbor and Swifty, played by Conner Chapman and Shaun Thomas, are two lads with absent or unsatisfactory dads and they don't fit in at school. Arbor is on medication for his ADHD and aggression issues – medication that suggests an official failure to understand his unhappiness – and he is a seriously bad influence on his mate Swifty, who has a natural love of horses. The boys discover they can make serious cash by pinching bits of metal and selling them to Kitten (Sean Gilder) the big, ferocious dealer who lurks in his scrapyard, a place of perpetual, wintry ugliness. Cynical and greedy Kitten accepts the boys' offerings and is none too concerned about the dirty means of getting them. But Arbor is dismayed when Kitten appears to favour Swifty as a possible jockey in the fantastically dangerous and illegal horse-and-cart drag races he's running. The race scene itself is a terrific nail-biter, a bravura black comic nightmare of horses and cars and high-speed desperation and cruelty. When Arbor and Swifty manage to persuade local lads to help them lift a burnt-out car onto the horse-drawn cart and slowly tow it all the way to the yard along the high street – with a traffic jam behind – it is a tremendously managed moment of black comedy. Of course, it is leading to tragedy, a tragedy of a gruesome and agonising kind. In Wilde's story, it is the discovery of marks on the body, stigmata, which is the turning point. I'm not sure whether Barnard intended her horrifying climax to be a specific allusion to this, or if it matters. But I found it moving in a very similar way to Wilde's story. There is no overt sacrifice and redemption, and by withdrawing the Christian theme, Barnard has created a religion-shaped gap which makes the ending more brutal, a vacuum into which rushes worldly pain but also a worldly sense of what people must try to learn from love and loss. This is a fine film, which cements Barnard's growing reputation as one of Britain's best film-makers."
2131	2132	Killing Them Softly – review 	"ovies about assassins generally show them as ascetic samurai loners, broodingly dismantling and reconstructing their weapons as they wait for the hit in monkish seclusion, chain-smoking, keeping small talk to a minimum with their employers, who are in a similar laconic state, and who, in any case, may be secretly awed by their hitman's icy professionalism. Killing Them Softly is different. This killer, Cogan – played by Brad Pitt – is relaxed and talkative; he is craggy, leonine, casual and imperious; absolutely on top of his game, but with a flaw. He cannot kill anyone he's met, and hates to kill up close, squeamish about them begging for mercy. So he has to murder at a distance; it's what he calls ""killing them softly"", though without acknowledging . Cogan is part antihero, part choric observer, terrifically acted by Pitt in this compelling movie from Andrew Dominik, the director who made (2000) and (2007). He has adapted the 1974 crime novel by George V Higgins and updated it to the America of 2008, the era of financial meltdown and political changeover. When , I found some of the overtly satirical moments too emphatic. The TV news on in the background will persistently give us Bush or Obama at ironic moments. But maybe the film's politics are part of its swaggering insolence. It is a violent ensemble nightmare of middle-management mobster incompetence in the tradition of Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, Casino and TV's The Sopranos. The drama is thrillingly and casually pessimistic, a world of weary tough guys complaining about having to clear up the mess left by other screw-ups, and for less money than they'd hoped for. This is a stiflingly and reekingly unhappy male world. Dominik deploys two classic tropes. From Pulp Fiction, there is the ""Royale with Cheese"" banal pre-violence conversation, and the classic gangster ""betrayal"" misdirection, which I associate with the buildup to Tommy DeVito's made-guy ceremony from GoodFellas. Someone gets shot, suddenly and at close range, having been lulled along with the audience into a false sense of security by a chat about what they were going to do later. The political dimension comes in two parts. In 2008, US taxpayers were asked to bail out banks for the sake of confidence and prestige, and these taxpayers also had to tighten their belts. Here, local wiseguy Markie (Ray Liotta) has to be whacked for robbing some other wiseguys' poker game: he didn't do it, but someone has to be seen to get killed for the sake of confidence and prestige, and hitmen have to accept a reduced fee in the economic climate. Cogan is contracted by an anonymous apparatchik played by Richard Jenkins, whose own criminal superiors are as cautious as any of the suits in corporate America: their paralysis is another symptom of the economic times. The robbery was actually done by two ridiculous jerks, Frankie and Russell, superbly played by Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, whose boss must also now be whacked: this is Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amato, played by Vincent Curatola. But Cogan subcontracts this wet job, and here is where Dominik shows how Cogan is guilty of sentimental incompetence. He gives the work to his old friend Mickey, hilariously played by James Gandolfini, who to Cogan's polite dismay, shows himself to be nowadays unequal to the task of contract killing: a heavy drinker and prostitute addict who is morosely in unrequited love with one of the girls he despises. Mickey exhibits the undignified emotions Cogan hates in his own victims. Could it be that Mickey, poor Mickey, is the endgame those in the business face? If they survive, that is. He is their future, in worse shape than anything in the morgue. equals chaos in Killing Them Softly. It's a reminder of what Tom Wolfe wrote: criminals are not romantic desperados who go outside the law to get what they want. They are ruthless, greedy, stupid people who get themselves into a progressively worsening, violent mess. There is an entropy in Killing Them Softly, a spiralling down; every scene, with its quarrelling and its bitching, its bantering and its bloodsplattering, is not leading anywhere as such – it's just an open-ended vivisectional demonstration of unhappiness and confusion. Dominik gives Pitt his grandstanding moment in terms of one satirical aria of a speech, contrived perhaps, and its moral-drawing jars with the icy amorality of all that has gone before. But it is delivered with such angrily dismissive power. This is an unrepentantly cynical take on the hope-and-change promised to the US in 2008; this year's election race makes it look even bleaker, an icily confident black comedy of continued disillusion."
2133	2134	Blade Runner 2 producers invite Harrison Ford to return for sequel 	"Producers of a planned sequel to the iconic sci-fi movie Blade Runner have taken the highly unusual step of the lead role to its original star, Harrison Ford. Alcon Entertainment, which has already convinced to return for a followup to his futuristic 1982 tale, issued a statement on Thursday extolling the virtues of its proposed follow up. The sequel will be written by Blade Runner's original architect Hampton Fancher, with Michael Green, the screenwriter of the poorly received Green Lantern movie from 2011. ""We believe that Hampton Fancher and Michael Green have crafted with Ridley Scott an extraordinary sequel to one of the greatest films of all time,"" said producers Broderick Johnson and Andrew Kosove in their joint statement. ""We would be honoured, and we are hopeful, that Harrison will be part of our project."" Alcon's move could be a last-gasp effort to convince the 71-year-old Ford that he should return to one of his best known roles, or simply an acknowledgment that the project faces commercial and critical purgatory without its best known asset. Scott had already shown himself to be willing to return to previously trodden sci-fi territory with 2012's Prometheus, a pseudo prequel to his classic space slasher from 1979. Meanwhile Ford is reprising his role as Han Solo in the forthcoming . Based on the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner was not an instant hit at the time but has gathered plaudits during the years since. Set in an overpopulated future Los Angeles that never sees the sunlight, Scott's movie is about a ""blade runner"" called Deckard, played by Ford, who has to hunt down a gang of android outlaws (replicants) who have escaped to Earth from an off-world colony. Negative criticism of the film was largely reversed with the arrival in 1992 of Scott's director's cut, which excised the original's voiceover and a pegged-on happy ending. Dick never wrote a sequel to the book, and three followup novels by his friend KW Jeter were poorly received. The new film's writers will therefore most likely be working to produce an original story. Alcon had that Ford's return for the sequel was unlikely. Apart from anything else, it would undercut the original film's central tantalising question – of whetherDeckard himself is a replicant – because the bioengineered humanoids do not live for more than a few years."
2135	2136	Don Jon and the rise of the pin-up director 	" Read enough interviews with Hollywood film stars and two themes keep cropping up. Theme one is that the star in question is working on a screenplay. Theme two is that they hope to become a director. Perhaps we can all take some comfort from the knowledge that, however much power and influence these stars may have, the vast majority never finish that screenplay or direct that film. A few stars do get around to directing when they've passed their acting peak (Robert De Niro, Tommy Lee Jones, Dustin Hoffman). A few manage the transition once they've established themselves as A-listers (George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes). And some (Ben Affleck) turn to directing in desperation, following several years of lurching from one flop to the next. But Warren Beatty aside, almost none start out as actors and switch to writing and directing just when their box-office clout is skyrocketing. Now, however, there are three. This week sees the British release of , an indie romcom written and directed by , who also plays the title role. Gordon-Levitt, star of Looper and 50/50, is 32; so is , who has made a ""fantasy neo-noir"" called . Three years their senior, has already completed a dozen features as writer-director-star, with more on the way, apparently. Coincidence? If it were, it would be remarkable enough. But there's more to these actors' newfound ""multi-hyphenate"" status: it's a sign that a new mood is creeping into Hollywood – one that has a fighting chance of revolutionising the industry. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. In itself, the decision to veer away from acting is a bold one for Gordon-Levitt and co. They're all rising stars. They're all pin-ups. And they're all respected by critics (Franco and Gosling are Oscar nominees, for 127 Hours and Half Nelson respectively). None has trouble landing roles in dramas, comedies or action movies – and they're all graduating to the leading-man phase of their careers. If their ambitions were more conventional, this would be the moment for them to make friends with and , and to swagger from one Oscar-baiting role to another. Instead, they're doing what Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Will Smith and Leonardo DiCaprio never did. They're making their own films – and they're not doing a bad job. How To Catch A Monster won't be seen until next year, but Franco's adaptation of was screened at the London film festival last month. While it isn't a triumph – there's a whiff of Ye Olde Heritage Village about it – it isn't embarrassing. Getting to the end of is already quite a feat, without then wringing an intelligent and engaging film from it. Gordon-Levitt's Don Jon is even more engaging. A cautionary tale about a New Jersey Don Juan whose porn addiction plays badly with his dream girl, , it's rough at the edges, as you might expect of a low-budget debut. But it's also big-hearted, thoughtful fun. And, considering that Gordon-Levitt is a Jewish Los Angeles native who's spent his life in showbiz, it's to his credit that he chose to write about an Italian-American east-coast bartender. All three men have been in showbiz for much of their lives, which might explain how comfortable they are with its non-acting aspects. Gordon-Levitt was on TV at the age of six, and starred in the sitcom Third Rock from the Sun throughout his teens. Franco was cast in Judd Apatow's when he was 19. And Gosling had the honour of being in alongside Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake, before playing a skinny demigod in Young Hercules. Presumably, early and prolonged exposure to the film-making process demystified it for them. Sitcom stars, certainly, have a track record of segueing into writing and directing: see also Josh Radnor from How I Met Your Mother and Zach Braff from Scrubs. Just as significantly, the precocious success enjoyed by Gordon-Levitt and the others seems to have cured them of the belief that either fame or regular work should be their holy grail. Franco, in particular, is keen to tell interviewers how unsatisfying he finds acting. He now devotes as much time to writing short stories, mounting art installations, and studying for a PhD at Yale. His debut novel, Actors Anonymous, was published last month. Gosling, meanwhile, prefers to take photographs, build sculptures, and help out in his restaurant than to sign up for a film that doesn't excite him. But there's more to their career changes than been-there-done-that nonchalance. All three actors, as popular as they are, have stated that the mainstream movie industry isn't for them. They've always gravitated towards challenging roles in interesting films, from (Franco) to a man in love with a sex doll in (Gosling). And now they're taking the next step away from Hollywood. ""Some of us are tired of all the sissies in this town,"" Gosling told New York Magazine in 2010. ""The ones who go along, flow with the flow, line up where they're told to line up at. The studios want you to make the same movie over and over – if that's the movie they liked, that's the movie you should keep making."" Gosling's scorn is understandable. He and his contemporaries were impressionable teenagers during the 1990s, when indie movies were in the ascendant, and when and the Sundance Festival made writing and directing seem like the hip pastimes of relatively autonomous auteurs. Since then, they've seen the indie scene collapse, crushed by ever-more superhero franchises and sequels (and they've been in a couple themselves). But they've also seen digital technology and the internet enable anyone to shoot and distribute a film, with or without a studio's approval. ""The entertainment business as it has been is not going to be around that much longer,"" Gordon-Levitt told GQ. ""The way it's going, there's going to be artists, and they'll make their shit, and they'll connect to their audience, and you don't need any of the middlemen – the studios or the agents."" Gordon-Levitt has put his money where his mouth is. With a personal investment of $500,000 (£313,000), he set up hitRECord, an online production company. The concept is that anyone can upload creative work to the site, whether it's a poem, drawing or snippet of music. Other hitRECord users can then tinker with it. ""Everyone on the site,"" says Gordon-Levitt on the introductory video, ""has permission to remix everyone else's stuff, so whatever you put up here, get ready to have it downloaded, sampled, built upon, refined, revised."" The result may become part of a book, record or concert, and the profits are split between the contributors and the company. is credited as a hitRECord production, and a televised hitRECord variety show is in the offing. Franco, too, is using the internet for crowdsourcing. Having poured his own money (""and I mean a lot"") into numerous student films, and having persuaded his A-list friends to appear in them, he has launched a campaign to find more funding for aspiring film-makers. Writing and directing, then, are just part of the story. We are seeing a wave of actors, who could easily milk the Hollywood status quo, choosing to seize the means of production – and hand them on to others. They're pushing the film industry towards a more diverse, democratic, independent future. When your local multiplex is showing the next dose of The Fast and the Furious, you may feel that future can't come soon enough."
2137	2138	The Dark Knight Rises – review 	"he spectacular, monolithic final movie in Christopher Nolan's trilogy is like a huge piece of industrial machinery: massive, grimly and brutally metallic, capable of lifting great weights and swinging the mightiest wrecking balls, but taking its time about it. The Batman (even after nearly a decade, no one in Gotham forgoes the definite article) has now been absent from the city for many years, and the city is happy with the specious explanation that the authorities have provided: namely, that the city's late District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) heroically gave his life fighting crime, and the Dark Knight, the arch-criminal, has slunk away. Billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne has gone into reclusive retirement: both are of course played with intelligence and no little charm by . But now two new subversive figures have burst on to the scene. A slinky, sexy cat burglar, played by , shows up in disguise at a charity fundraiser at Wayne Manor with lawbreaking on her mind. But more scary still, a sinister super-villain, aptly called Bane, is planning to lead an insurrection of underground warriors to destroy the city and take on the Dark Knight. He is a muscular slab of a man with an evil hold on his many followers, and with a hideous facial disfigurement, concealed by a creepy leather respiration mask. As played by Tom Hardy, Bane has presence and force, no question about it. But Heath Ledger's Joker had more charisma, more style, a limber and nimble-footed wickedness. And the Joker had one particular demonic superpower that Bane does not have. You could make out what he was saying. The film's release confirms what early test screenings of sample footage reportedly hinted at. Bane's animal snarl is often frankly indistinct. His voice sounds like Darth Vader shouting, while playing a bass accordion through a Harley Davidson exhaust pipe. There were times when I wanted Miriam Margoyles to come on, give Bane a brisk clip round the ear and say: ""Come on, darling, en – un – ci – ay – !"" Well, there is arguably something bestially menacing in that very unintelligibility; actually, the voice clarifies later in the movie, though for me the problem with Bane is in any case not with his voice, more with his conflict with the Dark Knight, of which more in a moment. This movie is operatic, crepuscular, portentous, a vision of apocalyptic catastrophe – and there are some great things in it. Christian Bale himself brings an interesting kind of wounded maturity to the double role, and Nolan elicits from Bale a performance which gives both Bruce Wayne and Batman a new life, as separate entities, by investigating their vulnerabilities and paranoia. When the Dark Knight returns, astride his extraordinary fat-wheeled motorbike, it's really exciting. gives a terrific performance as the young, idealistic police officer, Detective Blake, and Michael Caine is a calm, shrewd, heartfelt Alfred. Hathaway has a lovely line when some boorish male presumes to sneer at her fantastic high heels. ""Do they make it difficult to walk?"" She slices through his leg with one and replies pertly: ""I don't know – do they?"" But the film is clotted and extended with tiring and sometimes baffling subplots concerning the frankly uninteresting shenanigans of the Wayne Enterprises Board: there is some manoeuvring and personal petitioning from one Miranda Tate, played by Marion Cotillard, who shows herself in later sequences to be not a natural action performer. And I have to say I found Bane disappointing: his character promised much, but didn't quite deliver. The Joker's conflict with Batman was at least partly a cerebral affair, a matter of outsmarting and counter-outsmarting, and Bale raised his game in confrontation with Heath Ledger, who gave us a genuinely evil movie villain. Christian Bale is good in this film, too, of course – arguably more interesting in some ways. But there is simply no satisfying duel with Bane, and it seems to be ultimately more physical, a shuddering, juddering sumo-contest amid a panoply of CGI detonations. certainly confirms the weapons that Christopher Nolan can wield as a director: this is a big, brash, plausible movie on a self-consciously epic scale, a deafening superhero Bayreuth, taking place in a gloomy, almost physical smog of testosterone. It will certainly be a commercial smash, and you have to admire the confidence with which Christopher Nolan insists on the seriousness of the Batman mythology; he has thoroughly reinvented it, reauthored it and thought it through, in a way no other director has done with any other summer franchise. But I wish there was more yin and yang in the movie, rather than yin and more yin."
2150	2151	MP calls for inquiry into possible paedophile ring link to parliament 	"A ""powerful paedophile network"" may have had links to a former prime minister, No 10 and parliament, MPs have been told. , Labour MP, told the House of Commons there was ""clear intelligence"" suggesting a notorious group was connected to a former Number 10 aide, during prime minister's questions on Wednesday. He said the police file relating to Peter Righton, who was convicted in 1992 of importing child pornography from Holland, needed to be re-examined. ""The evidence file used to convict Peter Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring,"" Watson added. ""One of its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime minister, who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad. ""The leads were not followed up, but if the files still exist, I want to ensure that the Metropolitan police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10."" David Cameron said he would look at the case ""very carefully and see what the government can do to help"". ""You raise a very difficult and complex case and I'm not sure which former prime minister he is referring to. But what I would like to do is to look very carefully in Hansard as to the allegations you have made, the case that you have raised … and to see what the government can do to give you the assurances you seek,"" the prime minister added. Watson later expanded on the , saying he had been contacted by a former child protection specialist who was concerned that not all of the leads the police had when investigating Righton were followed up. ""The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed that one paedophile in particular was of great concern. He said that the paedophile, who worked with children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help get hold of indecent images of children,"" wrote Watson. ""The central allegation was that a large body of material seized in the raid on Righton's home had not been fully investigated. Though Righton was the subject of a BBC profile The Secret Life of a Paedophile, little had been done to follow up the leads from the case. A specialist unit in Scotland Yard had the material which supplemented a wider investigation into organised paedophile rings in children's homes."" The Labour MP said he was not naming the aide."
2153	2154	The Dark Knight Rises – review 	"hristopher Nolan's completes not only his personal trilogy focusing on socialite Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Gotham City's caped crusader, but also a cycle of popular culture that began in May 1939 when was added to Detective Comics' pantheon of superheroes. Batman's creator Bob Kane and his fellow comic-strip artists were all admirers of Fritz Lang's German movies, the forerunners of film noir, but this did not prevent them from becoming the object of a ferocious assault by Eisenhower-era moralists bent on suppressing horror comics during a crusade led by the psychiatrist Fredric Wertham. His 1954 book, , attacked Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson's menage as a covert celebration of homosexuality. Ten years later, however, when Notes on Camp promoted kitsch and the idea of ""it's good because it's bad"", became a TV series in garish comic-strip colour and was followed by a tongue-in-cheek film version and a revival of the serial, all 15 chapters being shown back-to-back to open London's latest super cinema. By 1989 the comic strip had been elevated to the status of ""graphic novel"", and Tim Burton invited us to give up our search for the inner child and find our dark sides in Michael Keaton's Batman, a Hamlet-like malcontent. Then, in the wake of 9/11, Nolan followed his complex and by reviving a now-moribund franchise. To misquote Scott Fitzgerald, he embarked on the search for the soul of the dark knight where it is always three o'clock in the morning. In 2005's he provided a new account of the creation myth, adding some kung fu, a touch of conspiracy and a dash of Bond to Kane's 1939 account of Bruce Wayne's orphaning. It was followed in 2008 by in which Heath Ledger takes the story to exhilarating heights of terror as the demonic Joker, an implacable enemy of Batman and mankind, part Lucifer, part Loki, part Osama bin Laden. On either side of , Nolan made and , films of exceptional brilliance, more individual in being free of the particular expectations of a franchise, but still pursuing personal preoccupations about identity, masks and lethal, morally confused games that also figure in the Batman films. The intellectually challenging final film, , sets out to reconcile issues raised in the first two. It brings Wayne's story to a suitably epic conclusion while at the same time offering the dramatic imbroglios, action set pieces, twists and surprises the form demands. To keep the franchise on ice rather than consigning it to the morgue, necessarily weaves a certain ambiguity into the ending. In a spectacular opening, far superior to the not dissimilar pre-credit sequence devised for the 1967 Bond movie , a plane used by the CIA for extraordinary rendition of alleged terrorists is hijacked in mid-air by a larger aircraft. Liberated by the manoeuvre is Bane (Tom Hardy), a muscular menace wearing a half-mask containing a voice box and an analgesic device that eases his constant pain. He's an associate of the League of Shadows, the ancient eastern conspiratorial cult to which a mysterious stranger (Liam Neeson) initiated Bruce Wayne in and which Wayne renounced as a gang of fascistic vigilantes. Physically Bane resembles Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader, and the artificial voice box makes his speech difficult to follow. This introduces a problem that runs through the film (or at least the version shown to the press last week). Perhaps for inscrutably perverse reasons, though more likely a fault in the balance between speech and Hans Zimmer's hyper-percussive score, much of the dialogue is unintelligible. This would be all right in most epics (who wouldn't want John Wayne's line ""Truly this man was the son of God"" lost by thunder?), but not here. has never been more baleful than as the crippled Wayne, eight years as a recluse in Wayne Manor, tended by the faithful family butler and surrogate father, Alfred (Michael Caine). Having taken the rap for the late Gotham DA, Wayne is the disgraced hero in exile, much like Philoctetes, the Greek archer who Ulysses must entice back to end the Trojan war. Having started in this classic role, the film's dramatic arc transforms Batman into a self-sacrificial Sydney Carton, and indeed there are numerous evocations of Dickens's , including the parallels drawn between the chaos of Gotham City and the reign of terror that followed the French revolution. What faces Gotham is a nihilistic movement spearheaded by Bane and assisted by capitalist interests and bankers. It starts with an assault on the Stock Exchange, continues with the theft of a nuclear device, and leads up to a familiar countdown to annihilation. Bane represents himself as a liberator but he's really a destroyer, a deceiver of a weak, easily misled populace. The contemporary parallels are clear, though the underlying politics are somewhat confused. One supposes that Nolan's views are not unlike Shakespeare's (or Dickens's) – a loathing of people acting as a mob, a deep suspicion of politicians and a belief in the preservation of social order in a fluctuating world. Anyway, Bale remains a strong moral presence. The established figures around him, mostly played by British actors – Caine's Alfred, Morgan Freeman's equivalent of Bond's Q, Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon – do their standard stuff. Of the newcomers, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who has a strong resemblance to Heath Ledger) is excellent and endearing as an honest young cop, and one would guess he'd be a significant figure were the franchise to be renewed. The new female leads, Marion Cotillard (rich philanthropist) and (Catwoman in all but name), have little to get their claws into. The special effects are often breathtaking, especially an overhead view of Gotham City in meltdown. The production designers have done a first-rate job. Wally Pfister's photography is uncompromisingly Stygian. A pity about the dialogue, but I'm sure something can be done about it, and maybe it works in the Imax form for which it was made. That being said, has an intelligence, epic thrust and visual grandeur far beyond its present box-office rival, Joss Whedon's ."
2157	2158	Anton Corbijn: 'I know just enough not to look stupid' 	"n the years since he used his dad's camera to snap an obscure prog-rock band called Solution, has remained besotted with photography. He's been such an exhaustive chronicler of U2 and Depeche Mode that he's known as both bands' invisible member. You may not know his picture byline, but you will know his images of Nirvana, Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, and Brian Eno. Then, three years ago, he became a film director, making the award-winning Control about troubled Mancunian glum rockers Joy Division. Corbijn giggles. ""I didn't really know how to make a film when I made Control. I had to create my own language, just as I did when I started taking photographs. I never studied either one."" But surely clueless film directors don't win prizes at Cannes? ""True, but film-making is extreme for me. I can't use lights. I need others to help me to put shots together. Directing film is the hardest thing I have ever done."" Even though you directed more than 100 rock videos? ""I know just enough not to look stupid. Mostly that means I know who to ask."" That is too modest. In fact, Corbijn has won several awards for his videos, including one for Nirvana's Heart-Shaped Box. When Kurt Cobain asked Corbijn to direct the video for Nirvana's next single, Pennyroyal Tea, Corbijn said he couldn't do better than his previous video, so declined. Cobain said if Corbijn wouldn't direct it, Nirvana would never make another video. They didn't. Now Corbijn has stepped even further from his comfort zone. Aged 55, he has directed his second feature, and it has nothing to do with music. Instead, The American is a hard-boiled, Hollywood-funded thriller starring as a hitman holed up in an Italian hill village. It's already been talked of as an Oscar contender and went straight to No 1 in the US box office over the commercially important Labor Day weekend – even though the critical reaction was mixed. ""A lot of critics were angry,"" laughs Corbijn. ""The trailer made it look like it was one thing – a fast-paced, popcorn, Hollywood thriller – when it was something else entirely. So when they got into the screenings and found that it was a European take on a western, they were furious."" That makes The American sound funless, which it isn't, but Corbijn certainly relishes stillness and silence. The gunshots that punctuate the film are startling, and the film's considerable tension comes from the fact that the audience knows so little about the hitman's motivations – except that the hunter has turned hunted and he ain't gonna stand for it. What U2's Bono said of Corbijn's photography applies to his cinema, too: ""He sees pleasure through guilty eyes and he sees good and evil in very dramatic ways."" ""I gave them Sergio Leone when some critics probably wanted Spider-Man 13,"" says Corbijn. His debt to the Italian maker of spaghetti westerns is overt: in one scene, when Clooney sips an espresso in an Italian cafe, the rest of the clientele is absorbed in a Leone classic on the TV. And, while Clooney's assassin is not quite a Man with No Name, he plays Jack in the manner Clint Eastwood neglected to patent, as an efficient, hard-faced killer unburdened by backstory or ethical code. Corbijn says he got the idea for the film from one of many scripts he was sent after Control. It was an adaptation of the novel A Very Private Gentleman by Martin Booth, in which a British assassin holes up in Abruzzo. ""I read the novel and thought there was a better script in it."" More importantly, he thought it would be better if the antihero were American, and Rowan Joffe's new script adhered to that stricture. ""I had worked with English actors on Control which was amazing, but I wanted to experience European and American actors. So I made the protagonist American and put him in Italy. ""I wanted to make a thriller in which you see people walk a lot. I like to watch people walk. I love body language. I don't like fast editing."" So how did Corbijn lure one of Hollywood's biggest stars to play in this outré-sounding project? ""George was into it, which surprised me. Maybe it's because he's never played such a dark character. Perhaps in Michael Clayton or Syriana he was unsympathetic, but he's never been this harsh or unappealing. It was fabulous for me that he was able to go that dark. He does so much with so little. He was ideal."" Making The American allowed Corbijn to revisit his childhood. He grew up in a small village on a small island off Rotterdam. ""There was nothing there. I was very shy and spent a lot of time on my own."" His father, also called Anton, was a Dutch Reformed Church minister. ""It was such a religious family that we didn't have a TV or a record player for a long time. ""Before we had a TV, I would go to the neighbours to watch Saturday morning TV. There was either Comedy Capers with Buster Keaton or western stuff like Rawhide. I always preferred the westerns, and this film is a tribute to those westerns. That was my heritage: American not Dutch."" Plus, I suggest to Corbijn, the film is about a loner as you once were and, perhaps, remain. ""I was certainly very shy, but I became something else because of photography."" As the credits roll on The American, we hear two Dutch rock songs on the soundtrack, She Was Naked by Supersister and Windows of My Eyes by Cuby and the Blizzards. ""Nobody outside Holland will have heard of them, but I photographed these bands when I was young, and they meant a great deal to me. Putting the songs in the film is my way of thanking those bands for giving me a life."" Corbijn became a professional photographer for Dutch pop mags after shooting Solution in Groningen. ""When those pictures – which weren't very good – got published, I thought: 'Bingo! I'm in!'"" Aged 24, he decided to try his luck as a photographer across the North sea. He didn't get a warm welcome. ""Within two weeks of arriving, I was photographing Joy Division. I tried to shake hands with them, but they refused."" That was November 1979. ""I met Ian [Curtis, the band's lead singer] once more and then he was dead."" And yet one of the most memorable images of Curtis is by Corbijn, depicting the singer sitting cross-legged and angst-ridden on an amp. Not long afterwards, he was made chief photographer at the New Musical Express. ""I remember the then editor Neil Spencer showing me the office. The journalists were hunched over their typewriters. I remember one singing: ' I hate the fucking Dutch. They live in windmills and wear clogs.' And the last line of the song went: 'Worst of all, I hate the fucking Danes.' At least, I thought, I wasn't Danish."" Did being a foreigner help you establish an intimacy with your subjects? ""I suppose so – I wasn't seen as very threatening even though I'm very tall. Perhaps it's my gangliness rather than my foreignness that makes me less threatening."" Corbijn detects five periods in his oeuvre. ""First came the documentary period – I was outside looking in. Then there was the portrait period – when a lot of doors opened and I was looking from the inside. Then I had a third period in which fame became interesting – I was inside looking out."" The fourth period was the most unexpected for this shy Dutch boy. He became a performer, emulating the great photographic artist Cindy Sherman. He got made up, put himself on the other side of the camera and shot himself in bleak Dutch settings disguised as a series of dead musicians – John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Sid Vicious, Elvis, Frank Zappa. The resulting book was a revealing document about his obsessions. ""I guess I always wanted to be 'a somebody', and I only admitted this to myself in my 40s,"" he said. One of the happiest moments in his professional life, he says, was when Depeche Mode's drummer couldn't make it to the Top of the Pops studio so Corbijn (an amateur drummer) stepped in and was paid by the BBC for his performance. ""Now I'm on my fifth period. I take a lot of photographs of painters like Lucian Freud and Richard Prince."" Why? ""I'm a frustrated painter. You're totally your own boss. You don't have to travel."" Corbijn does have to travel for his work. ""I'm always on the road. That's why I haven't got kids – it would be hopeless for them and for me,"" he says. He is divorced and now lives, at least notionally, in the Hague. At this point, Corbijn stands up and asks to be excused for a moment. His eyes are hurting, and he needs to bathe them in the bathroom. Sore eyes, I can't help thinking, are the result of a life spent looking. When he comes back, I remind him of what he wrote in the introduction to one of his photography books: ""It feels to me like I just hacked my way out of the eggshell and just started looking around me with all the undirected eagerness and curiosity of a young chicken."" After 55 years, that chicken is still curious, though his eager gaze is more directed. Do you not want to settle down? ""Not really. I still love my job, and my friends are all on the road, or scattered around the globe. You have a simple camera and you meet interesting people and have a cup of tea and go home. There's nothing not to like about that."" But surely photography and film-making are about more than that for you? ""Of course they are. They're about playing with my friends. When I was little boy I didn't have many. Now I have a few."""
2163	2164	Jack O'Connell to tilt at lead role in Terry Gilliam's revived Don Quixote film 	Former Skins star Jack O’Connell’s latest high-profile Hollywood role will be as the lead in Terry Gilliam’s famously long-gestating Don Quixote movie, the director’s seventh attempt to bring the story to the big screen, . O’Connell, who is also starring in Angelina Jolie’s second world war biopic Unbroken and currently on screens in the Troubles-set thriller ‘71, will play the role variously earmarked for and Ewan McGregor in previous iterations of Gilliam’s fantasy epic. The UK-based film-maker hopes to finally begin shooting in the spring for a 2016 release, a remarkable 17 years after the Spanish set of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote was hit by flash floods in 1999. “Seven is my lucky number so let’s break the curse and make it!” joked Gilliam of his Sisyphean efforts. The disastrous weather that plagued the shoot for The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, along with veteran French star Jean Rochefort finding himself unable to film after being diagnosed with a double herniated disc, eventually saw Gilliam decide to abandon the movie. His Iberian travails are famously catalogued in the documentary . In the original storyline for The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, Depp was due to play a 21st-century advertising executive who travels back in time to 17th-century Spain, where he meets Don Quixote (Rochefort, who spent seven months learning English for the role) and becomes involved in his adventures after Don Quixote mistakes him for Sancho Panza. Variety describes a rather different plot, in which a jaded commercials director named Toby (O’Connell) travels to Spain for a shoot and comes across a gypsy who gives him a copy of his student film, a reworking of the Don Quixote story set in a quaint local village. Moved by the discovery, the ad man sets off on a bizarre road trip to find the location where the student film was shot and gets caught up in a series of misadventures. “Our main character actually made a Don Quixote movie a lot earlier in his history, and the effect it had on many people wasn’t very nice,” . “Some people go mad, some people turn to drink, some people become whores.” There have previously been . The new film, now titled simply Don Quixote, is budgeted at $21m. The Man Who Killed Don Quixote would reputedly have been one of the most expensive continental European films ever made at a cost of $32.1m.
2167	2168	Ed Miliband says he urged Gordon Brown to sack Damian McBride 	"Ed Miliband has confirmed that he advised Gordon Brown to sack because of the factional way in which he briefed against ministerial colleagues. The leader drew a contrast with Brown's abrasive former press secretary as he said he had gone out of his way to move on from ""the practices of the past"" as he worked to ensure he ran a united party. Speaking on the , Miliband joked that he could never have been part of the ""macho"" group around Brown. Asked about the under Brown and Tony Blair in the 1990s, he laughed as he replied: ""I'm not sure I've ever been accused of being macho. I think that is a first. I will take that away. I think there are definitely lessons to be learned from the past."" In his main television interview of the , Miliband dismissed recent poor opinion polls as he said he would be focusing on the increasing costs of living. ""Polls go up and down – one thing goes up and up is the cost of living for ordinary families,"" he said after a new YouGov/Sunday Times poll found that only 17% of respondents thought he was up to the job of prime minister. Miliband, who announced overnight that he would review the level of the minimum wage and make companies who hire a skilled worker from outside the EU train a UK apprentice in return, also: Launched a strong attack on Nick Clegg for propping up the Tories in government. ""I really hate what he is doing with this government. I hate the way he is an accomplice for what has happened in this government in the last three years on the health service, on taxation, on benefits, on a whole range of things."" Ruled out making an early commitment to hold an in-out referendum on British membership of the EU, but left open the possibility of changing his stance before the election. ""We set out a very, very clear position on this but we will set out our position at the election,"" he said. Pledged to stop building any more free schools and to prevent existing ones from expanding. But he said he would not close ""good schools"". But Miliband also faced questions about the revelations in the memoirs by McBride, who served as Brown's press secretary in the Treasury and in Downing Street. McBride has admitted spreading damaging stories against Labour ministers who appeared to challenge Brown. The Labour leader said of the McBride memoirs: ""It is a reminder that we must have no factions and no briefing in the Labour party. That is my absolute position. ""Day one, when I became leader, I said that. Whatever views people have, I think people appreciate that the way I run my party is on the basis of a unified party, not a disunited party, and a party that doesn't engage in all those practices of the past."" Asked by Marr whether he had advised Brown to remove McBride, he said: ""I did."" The Labour leader said that he told the Leveson inquiry of his concerns about McBride. He said: ""I went to the Leveson inquiry and was asked about this and I said – and it is a matter of public record – I was concerned about the activities of Damian McBride and indeed I complained to . ""I was worried that there were indications that he was briefing against colleagues and I didn't think that was the way politics should be practised. It was more people tell you these sorts of things are going on and you have enough suspicion that they are. That was something I made clear to Gordon. I thought it was damaging to the Labour party."" Miliband is focusing the Labour conference on the crisis of the growing cost of living after figures showed that in 37 of the 38 months the coalition has been in office, inflation has outstripped pay rises. He said: ""For generations in this country when the economy grew the majority of people got better off. Now that vital link between the growing wealth of the country and people's family finances has been broken. ""The question is for the British people: is there a party that is going to tackle that? It is about creating higher-paying jobs in this country, which is why our policy on apprenticeships, for as many as 100,000 more apprenticeships, is so important; it is about fairer decision tax, [repealing] the bedroom tax; and it is also about cracking down on some of those vested interests – the train companies who are taking people for a ride under this government."""
2171	2172	Terry Gilliam on his Don Quixote disaster 	"aking a film', tells me, 'is essentially about two things: belief and momentum. You need those two essential elements, one feeding the other, or things fall apart.' There speaks the voice of experience. Last September, just five days into an ambitious shooting schedule, Gilliam's film, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, a vision he had nurtured for 10 years, collapsed in the most cruelly ironic fashion. A full five months later, the director, whose belief in the project had propelled its often tortuous progress from script to shoot, is still in grief: more than once he refers to this interview as 'a kind of therapy session'. 'A part of me still doesn't quite believe it happened,' he says, nursing a pre-lunch malt whisky in a Soho private members' club, his natural ebullience suddenly replaced by an uncharacteristically rueful tone. 'I mean, it had been a difficult project from day one, but what happened was so cruelly absurd, so surreal and devastating, I think it still has a grip on me.' What happened was also utterly beyond his control. On day one of the shoot, amid the brown, sun-burnished hills of Aragon and Navarra in northern Spain, 70-year-old Jean Rochefort, who had landed the part on Gilliam's insistence - 'He could act, he could horse ride, he was Don Quixote' - began feeling ill. He was suffering from a prostate infection, but, as Gilliam attests: 'It suddenly seemed a lot more serious. He looked like an 80-year-old rather than a 70-year-old and it was obvious he was in pain. Day one and already we were in deep shit.' On the second day, while the film's main star Johnny Depp prepared to shoot his initial scenes, the heavens opened and a flash flood washed away the entire set. 'It was a tempest,' says Gilliam, a man, as his films illustrate, not naturally inclined to understatement. 'It was like a punishment for everything bad I had ever done in my life. It was like Job.' On day four, while the crew tried to rebuild the set and scrape layers of mud from costumes and props, Gilliam realised that the entire landscape had changed colour. 'Nothing matched. We were trying to fake shots, anything to keep going.' On day five, the first assistant director took the already exhausted director aside and said he was refusing to let Jean Rochefort continue working. A row ensued. Rochefort, though now in serious pain, insisted on getting back in the saddle. The cameras rolled for an hour. It took three men to get him down off the horse; the next day he was airlifted to hospital in Paris where he was operated on for a double hernia. 'And that,' sighs Gilliam, 'was the end of the movie.' But not, unfortunately, the end of the story. When the news broke that neither Depp nor his partner, Vanessa Paradis, could wait around for Rochefort to recover due to other film commitments, some insurers decided to pull the plug on the project. It is nothing short of a miracle, given that the film's complicated financial backing came from England, Spain, France and Germany, that all major investors have since been paid back. With the total insurance bill sitting at an estimated $16 million, it remains to be seen if cast and crew will be as fortunate. 'Initially, the insurers wanted us to recast and reshoot within four weeks but that was an impossibility,' says the director, whose previous films include Brazil, The Fisher King and Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, as well as Baron Munchausen, an equally ambitious Hollywood studio backed film which spiralled over budget back in 1989. 'There is no way I could have found a replacement for Jean in that time, plus the other actors had prior commitments and the locations had been lined up months in advance for specific dates.' The movies was a troubled project, though, long before the director, cast and crew decamped to Spain. Gilliam first dreamt up the film when he was suffering from what he calls PMS (Post Munchausen Syndrome) back in 1990. 'I called my old friend Jake Eberts (the executive producer of Munchausen), and said, ""I have two names for you: Quixote and Gilliam. And I need $20m."" He said, ""Done!"" I then sat down and read the book and thought, Jesus, this is unfilmable.' (It speaks volumes about both Gilliam's methodology and his self-belief that he pitched the idea for the film without having read the book, and that, having read the book and realised he had an impossible task on his hands, then set about the project with the kind of blind faith that Quixote himself would have been proud of.) From the start, Gilliam, perhaps chastened by his experiences in Hollywood, wanted to make the film in Europe, with European money. He took the script initially to US producer Chuck Roven (with whom he had worked on 12 Monkeys ) and to the London-based Sarah Radclyffe Productions,. Together, Gilliam and Radclyffe approached Pathé Films, who had just set up offices in London, and Canal Plus in Paris. 'We started to do a little dance,' says Gilliam, 'and these dances take a long time - especially where the French are concerned.' By then, the proposed budget had gone up to $35m. Enter Rainer Mockert, a German producer whose very name causes Gilliam to wince. According to the director, Mockert's enthusiasm for the project won everyone over, and as the shooting date of summer 1999 neared, his proposed slice of the budget grew and grew. In July, though, one month before the shoot, Mockert's promised money, which was to come from a private German tax shelter fund, had still not materialised. As Mockert pleaded for more time, Depp was offered the lead in Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried . 'We were desperately trying to keep Johnny on board and he was committed to the film,' Gilliam elaborates, 'but he was being offered $2m for three weeks' work while we were expecting him to do 17 weeks' work for the same fee.' In the end, according to Gilliam: 'Rainer just didn't have the money. Legally the documents were there, but nothing was signed. He wanted us to put back the schedule but a film is like air traffic control, you're locking in all the pieces in order that everything moves forward according to plan.' Angered, but undaunted, Gilliam continued his increasingly complex dance with the European backers. A bridge of $500,000 was provided by London production company, @radical media, who handled Gilliam's rare sorties into commercials. With the Pathé money still in place, René Cleitman from another French company, Hachette Premiere, took over production in August 1999, demanding a new budget and schedule, and promising to have the money in place by the end of November. 'The problem was, René would not speak to Sarah Radclyffe, who had loads of knowledge, and was being very gracious even though she was no longer attached to the film.' Soon after, a meeting with Pathé further stoked Gilliam's now burgeoning frustration with the French way of doing business. 'Suddenly, in the middle of a script meeting, Alexis Lloyd (erstwhile managing director of Pathé UK) starts talking about money, saying they want the budget brought down to $25m. I got on the phone to the other financiers and started screaming. Canal Plus and Pathé were so embarrassed, they immediately offered us some money.' Finally, in January 2000, Cleitman proposed a revised budget of £31m. Depp, meanwhile, having finished shooting the Sally Potter part, now had another offer for a much bigger budget movie, entitled Blow. 'We still don't have the right money, the lawyers are taking forever because we've stumbled into a pan-European tax nightmare because the rules are different in every country. Everyone, including myself and the writer, Tony Grisoni, is working for nothing. The process is dragging on interminably and killing the momentum. The only person who is happy is Jean Rochefort who is steadily working away learning English.' It was around this time, Gilliam says, that he 'realised the abyss between Hollywood and France'. To secure a star such as Johnny Depp, it is common, in America at least, to offer what is known as a pay-or-play deal, which ensures that the actor gets paid even if the film is not made. This, according to Gilliam, was anathema to the French, who are suspicious of all things Hollywood. 'They just could not, or would not, understand that without the star, the film does not get made.' British film producer Andrea Calderwood, who then worked as head of production at Pathé, and had fought hard to back Gilliam's vision, concurs: 'I had one French producer say to me, ""It's not for us to commit to Johnny Depp, it's for him to commit to us"".' Calderwood, who was responsible at Pathé for backing The Claim, an equally ambitious film by British director, Michael Winterbottom [reviewed on page 7], and who was instrumental in securing £2m from Lottery funds for The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, pinpoints what is perhaps the key subtext to this salutary story. 'There is a different approach to filmmaking in France. The producer, for instance, can be personally responsible for the finance, and can often bond the film themselves. That obviously affects the producer's relationship towards the film. I also think there was a general nervousness about Terry who is seen, rather unfairly, as a maverick but, who actually has an incredibly good understanding of the realities involved in the financing and production process. He took a lot of responsibility for pushing through the financial negotiations and I often felt frustrated on his behalf because ultimately there seemed to be a fundamental lack of confidence in his ability to deliver the film for the money.' In the end, the film went ahead when new German investors KC Medien came on board, but not before another eleventh-hour drama occurred. Just before the October shoot, with the £32m budget finally in place, Gilliam received a call from an aggrieved Johnny Depp who, by now, 'was convinced that he was being majorly jerked around by the French'. Depp's agent had only just got around to telling the actor the exact figure he would earn for starring in The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. 'Johnny was already becoming obsessional about the film but, when the actual amount was mentioned, he went apeshit. He told me he wanted twice as much. All the money's in place, and this happens.' In the end, Gilliam, who was already working for half his normal fee, settled for a quarter, and Johnny Depp settled for half again of what he wanted. Thus, the long, complex and ill-omened pre-production financial dance finally ended. If there was a bigger lesson to be learnt from all this, it is best summed up by Andrea Calderwood, who now fronts her own production company, Slate Films: 'There's a general consensus that we should be making bigger scale European films, say $20m and upwards. In order to do that, we need to have the confidence to back directors who can work at that scale.' The Man Who Killed Don Quixote did, in the end, start shooting last October. The rest, as they say, is history: a flash flood and a double hernia finally did what the money men, the lawyers and the oceans of Euro red tape had failed to do - kill off Gilliam's decade-long labour of love in a matter of days. 'It's funny,' he sighs, 'but I always find that the process of making a film tends to echo the actual story and, in this case, I started to feel like Quixote, always tilting at windmills. The thing is, though, if I am being honest, there was a certain relief when it collapsed. For the first time in my life, I was starting a film and I didn't feel joyful. There was about six hours of joy when me and Johnny were shooting together in the desert, getting ideas, inventing stuff. But, that was it. It just didn't feel right. I was exhausted by all the other stuff. I guess I need that joy in order to work.' We will have to wait and see whether The Man Who Killed Don Quixote will be attempted a third time, though the director is adamant it will. 'I am going to make this damn film,' he shouts at one point, 'but maybe down the line. I can't even look at it right now. I can't even think about it. I mean, I'm supposed to be shooting right now, out there surrounded by creative people, thinking up new ideas, in my element. Instead, I'm sitting at home on the computer again. It's not,' he adds, 'the same thing at all.' © Sean O'Hagan 22 November 1940 in Medicine Lake, Minnesota. Birmingham High School and Occidental College; studied political science.

2190	2191	BT Sport steps into the ring to take on the TV heavyweight 	"BT Sport, launched on Thursday night by its parent company in a bold £1bn bid to take on , will hope that it is not an inauspicious sign that one of its heavily trailed ""ambassadors"" might be about to trade the Premier League for La Liga. While Gareth Bale, one of several high-profile names signed to promote three new sport channels that will launch with a special 6pm show anchored by Jake Humphrey and featuring many of its on-screen names, ponders his future the broadcaster is nervously awaiting viewer reaction to its own gamble. BT has invested well over £1bn in its new channel already, including a £738m deal for 38 Premier League matches a season and a lavish new state-of-the-art studio on the Olympic Park, and hopes to succeed where ITV Digital, and ESPN have failed, in taking on Sky. It believes it is already reaping the rewards – more than 500,000 customers have signed new 12-month BT Broadband contracts to receive the channel free or paid the requisite £12 a month to sign up. But Sky, which has built its business on the back of Premier League football and other live sports, chose Wednesday to talk up its new schedule and technological advances at its own shiny new £330m studio complex in west London. It will show 116 matches a season and claims its new schedule, which features a radically overhauled audience-based show that runs throughout the day on Saturday and a revamped Monday Night Football featuring Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, will keep it ahead of the competition. Marc Watson, chief executive of BT TV, said the new channel's output should not be judged on the first day alone, when it will be broadcast free for anyone with Freeview, TV from BT or Sky, but admitted it was a crucial moment for the company. ""It is a big day for the company. We take a long-term view of this. Perceptions of the company are changing, they have been changing for a while and has accelerated that."" In a bid to overshadow BT's launch Sky are going live to all 92 clubs on Thursday. The Sky Sports News executive editor Andy Cairns said the aim was to capture a snapshot of English football on the eve of the Football League kick-off. The two rivals have been locked in a bitter war of words since the fixtures were carved up, with Sky insisting that in contrast to BT's marketing rhetoric the newcomer's line up is ""no game-changer"". In response, BT Retail's chief executive Gavin Patterson has called Sky's presentational style ""cold"" and promised a warmer, more-inclusive style with more family appeal. The hiring of Humphrey, and Danny Baker is part of that strategy, as is the development of the biggest purpose-built sports studio in Europe to play host to hours of live programming that it hopes will differentiate it from Sky. BT also has the rights to Premiership rugby, WTA Tour tennis, the FA Cup and a host of overseas football leagues. But not, ironically, the possible destination of its big-name ambassador Bale – La Liga will remain on Sky. ""We'll still be broadcasting on Friday. Of course people will look at the first night, but we're in this for the long term. We have a vision for what the channel is going to be. What we all hope here is that we'll get a decent start tomorrow night. We also hope we'll get more than one day,"" said Watson, talking up pre-season fare involving Liverpool and Manchester United, as well as a tournament involving Laura Robson in its first week. ""We'll look back later in the year and take a view on how well we've done. We've done an enormous amount very quickly and we've worked incredibly hard to do that. We're ready to go. The studio is working and operating. We've got all the right people. I'm not sure there's anything we'd want to do that we haven't."" At Sky, its head of football, Gary Hughes, promised a range of innovations for the coming season and said its 21 years of experience in covering Premier League football would tell. ""A new system that was tested last season will record every movement of every player and will provide new options for graphics and data, while another will give Neville and other pundits the opportunity to analyse the action during a match rather than after it."" The broadcaster is also making much of its on-the-go services, with the head of digital media, Dave Gibbs, trumpeting the 250,000 viewers who watched Manchester United play Real Madrid on smartphones and tablets via Sky Go last season as evidence of a significant shift in viewing habits. A new iPad app designed to accompany viewing on the big screen, Sky 360, will effectively give viewers access to the same tools as those used by Neville, Carragher and Jamie Redknapp in the studio during a live match. Increasingly, Sky is pointing to its technology and the breadth and depth of its companion offerings such as Sky Sports News, as well as its stable of rights, in order to convince its customers that their substantial monthly outlays remain good value. The head of presentation and production, Steve Smith, said it remains committed to 3D broadcasts, despite the BBC recently jettisoning its plans for the technology. Behind the verbal jousting and the on-screen stardust lies a bitter battle for broadband, television and phone customers between the two companies. There is an ongoing duel over whether Sky should offer its channels to BT's YouView service, while BT has yet to agree a deal with the cable operator Virgin Media to broadcast its channels. Watson took aim at Sky's distribution tactics: ""We do still think it's odd that the monopoly player in the market has no obligation to provide their product. You don't have Tesco going out and buying up all the milk and saying no one else can have it."" Rights holders, meanwhile, will be hoping that the increasingly bitter battle between the two broadcasters translates to more competition. While Sky has tied up many of its rights until the end of the decade, there will be Uefa Champions League and International Cricket Council rights on the market before long. ""When rights holders bring things to market, we'll take a look and see if it makes sense. If they do, you can expect us to take a view,"" says Watson."
2191	2192	Angelina Jolie casts Skins star Jack O'Connell in new movie Unbroken 	Skins star Jack O'Connell has signed on for the lead role in . Based on a screenplay which has been rewritten by Oscar-winning film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, Jolie's second movie as director follows the story of real-life American second-world-war hero Louis Zamperini. It is based on Seabiscuit author Laura Hillenbrand's 2010 novel Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption. Zamperini, a one-time Olympic track star, made headlines after surviving for 47 days without food or water when his US airforce plane crash-landed in the Pacific in 1943. Having endured shark attacks, aerial assaults and extreme hunger, he was eventually picked up by the Japanese after coming ashore on an island behind enemy lines. Zamperini's captors imprisoned him for two years, during which time he was tortured. He survived the ordeal and now lives in Hollywood. He is 96. O'Connell, 22, is best known for his portrayal of chaotic teenager James Cook in the long-running Bristol-set Channel 4 drama, which is currently airing its final series. He will also be seen as Calisto in comic-book sequel next year. Jolie is producing as well as directing , which is also due for release in 2014.
2192	2193	This Is England 	" continues his fast and fluent film-making career with this quasi-autobiographical picture about skinheads: a movie with hints of Alan Clarke's Made in Britain and, in its final image, the haunted disenchantment of Truffaut's The 400 Blows. It is a sad, painful and sometimes funny story from the white working classes of 1980s Britain, the cannon-fodder caste alienated from Falklands rejoicing on the home front and not invited to participate in the nation's promised service-economy prosperity. Meadows boldly attempts to reclaim the skinhead from the traditional neo-Nazi image, explicitly distinguishing his characters from a separate racist influence, and presenting them as an anarchic youth tribe that idolised West Indian music. He sees their susceptibility to the extremist right as a poignant and even tragic part of their fatherless culture, literally and figuratively orphaned by the times. There's a winning lead performance from 13-year-old newcomer Thomas Turgoose playing a put-upon lad called Shaun in the run-down Grimsby of 1983. His dad was a serviceman killed in the Falklands and he's perennially getting picked on for this, and for his horrible flared jeans which make him look, as one bully cruelly puts it, like Keith Chegwin's son. Sloping and moping his way home after a standard-issue school day of humiliation, Shaun gets waylaid by some skins in a dodgy underpass, but instead of yet more battering, the gang give him sympathy and understanding; they become Shaun's only friends, and with a new Ben Sherman shirt and number one cut, Shaun has new pride and a new identity. The gang's leader is Woody - a cheerful, sparky performance from Joe Gilgun - and they have an African-Caribbean member facetiously nicknamed Milky, played by Meadows regular Andrew Shim; Shaun even finds romance with one of the group's girl-punk fellow travellers: a languid and rather elegant older woman called Smell (Rosamund Hanson) who earnestly explains to Shaun's mum that she is called that simply because it rhymes with Michelle. The idyll is soon destroyed with the highly unwelcome appearance of Combo, a ferocious and sinister skin warrior just out of prison, played by Stephen Graham. He demands the group join his National Front cell, and turn out for an NF meeting in a tatty pub, addressed by one of the movement's suit-wearing officer class, played in cameo by Frank Harper. Turgoose is the picture's heart and soul, and it's a terrifically natural, easy and commanding performance. Turgoose's open face radiates charm, and then, when he goes over to the dark side of racism, a creepy, anti-cherubic scorn: almost like one of the little blond kids in Village of the Damned. But Meadows is always concerned to preserve a sympathetic core to Shaun, and in fact to all the skins. Even the deeply objectionable Combo is shown to be suffering from emotional pain. Like Meadows' earlier pictures, Dead Man's Shoes and A Room for Romeo Brass, This Is England is about younger, vulnerable figures being taken under the wing of older, flawed men, and this personal theme here finds its richest and maturest expression yet. As to whether we should buy its implied leniency about skinhead culture: that is another question. The West Indian influence is advanced as proof that skins were not necessarily racist: yet it can't cancel out Combo's hate campaign against South Asians, the ""Pakis"" who ""smell of curry"", a campaign which goes quite unchallenged or even unremarked upon by any of the skins, good or bad. The skinhead identity is, after all, obviously supposed to be more aggressive than that of other tribes: I remember as a 10-year-old cowering on the terraces of Watford football club in the early 70s, as the Luton boot boys got stuck in, and my father grimly telling me that the reason they shaved their heads that way was so the coppers couldn't grab them by the hair. Whether or not that is true, it certainly made the wearer's head look like a big, third clenched fist. And it's still difficult to get a handle on them. Meadows appears to want to find emotional truths behind the bravado, to find reasons for the male rage. It's a valid quest, and there are telling and touching moments, particularly between Turgoose and Rosamund Hanson. I found myself wishing that their love story could occupy more of the film, maybe for the same reason that the Shane Meadows film I have enjoyed most is the one his real fans loathe: the comedy Once Upon a Time in the Midlands. But from the get-go of this drama, it is obvious that things are heading only one way: towards a climactic flourish of violence, and it's a glum business wondering to whom and from whom this is going to happen. This is a violent subject, and these are violent people, and yet I couldn't help feeling that Meadows is, as so often, more comfortable with machismo than with the humour and gentleness which play a smaller, yet intensely welcome part of his movies. However agnostic I confess to still feeling about his work, there's no doubt that Meadows is a real film-maker with a growing and evolving career, and with his own natural cinematic language. When I think of his films, I think, for good or ill: this is English cinema."
2197	2198	Mark Kermode's DVD round-up 	"rom the moment Danish anarcho-prankster Lars von Trier that he was ""a Nazi"" (an ill-judged joke referring to his late-life discovery that his biological father was not Jewish but German – boom boom!), it was clear that his end-of-the-world epic (Artificial Eye, 2011, 15) was going to be eclipsed by controversy. Von Trier has since vowed never to speak again in public, which is probably a good thing because it means the work will have to speak for itself. And whatever you may think of Lars's bull-in-a-china-shop humour (he compares himself charitably to the European folklore figure Clumsy Hans), the fact remains that this oddly operatic vision of the apocalypse is one of his most satisfying films to date. A less hysterical companion piece to the genital-slicing horrors of , paints a portrait of a depression so deep that it literally brings about the end of the world. The opening scenes depict the obliteration of Earth to the strains of Wagner, making it clear from the outset that everything is moving only one way and things are not going to end well. From here we flash back to the wedding reception of Kirsten Dunst's self-absorbed antiheroine, a typically strained affair that plays out in a massive mansion whose lavish grounds are slowly overshadowed by the appearance of a mysterious blue planet that may or may not be on a collision course with Earth. Returning to the idea that ""nature is Satan's church"", von Trier offers images of this cosmically misaligned character (who is clearly on some level a cipher for himself) drawing down the moon, basking naked in the eerie night-time glow of the titular planet that promises an end to all the evils of mankind. Meanwhile Charlotte Gainsbourg's jittery sibling becomes increasingly distraught about the fate of her children, her maternal instincts instilling her with the desperate will to live while her sister sardonically embraces her inevitable end. If all this sounds like an unbearably overwrought cross between and with a ponderous dash of thrown in for good measure, then fear not. Von Trier has already expressed discomfort with the ""double-cream"" aesthetic of his most accessible film to date, seemingly appalled by his own ability to make a movie with anything vaguely resembling ""mainstream"" appeal. Perhaps the whole Cannes debacle was a subconscious attempt to subvert the impending spectre of success, putting a gun to his own head before someone else placed a crown upon it? If so, it hasn't worked. Despite his best efforts to the contrary, has shown up on several influential ""best of 2011"" lists, faring far better than the strangely comparable , which looks positively flippant by comparison, and reminding us that there is more to von Trier's movies than cheap stunts. Sometimes. His next film is , which will apparently include porno penetration a-go-go but about which the director has promised to keep his mouth shut. Personally, I'll believe it when I see it. And in the case of , seeing is believing. Altogether less adventurous, (Universal, 2010, 15) divides its time between the 1960s and the 1990s, with playing a retired Mossad agent, famous for capturing and killing a renegade Nazi in East Berlin. As her daughter publishes a book celebrating her mother's exploits, Mirren and her latterday counterparts are thrown back into the murky past where the awful truth about their not-so-glorious escapades still lurks. It's perhaps unsurprising that the earlier sections of the drama work best, with rising star Jessica Chastain excelling as the young secret agent faced with a suitably slimy monster in the imposing form of Jesper Christensen. Like Laurence Olivier in , Christensen is at his creepiest when playing the role of genial medic, politely blending in with the crowd, hiding his horrible history. There are a couple of nicely staged action set pieces, not least the rail-stop heist sequence that director John Madden executes with energy and efficiency. Less satisfying are the later sections in which some of the tension dissipates and contrivance takes over, although the screenwriters (including Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman) wrestle effectively with the Israeli source film , on which this is based. Much to like, then, if ultimately not quite so much to remember. Like Taylor Lautner in the movies, Jason Statham is very good at taking off his shirt, and for maximum enjoyment his films should include at least one sequence in which ""the Stath"" is forced to wrestle a bunch of disrobed beefcake extras, preferably in a large pool of excitingly slippery motor oil. Such a scene is sadly absent from (2011, Entertainment, 15), which is not a remake of Sam Peckinpah's similarly monikered 1970s thriller, but, rather, a ""based (very loosely indeed) on a true story"" adaptation of Ranulph Fiennes's secret agents book . It's nuts-and-bolts fare, with De Niro earning the rent as Statham's kidnapped special-ops mentor, whose plight draws his protege out of retirement, and Clive Owen generally chewing the scenery and experimenting with fiendish hair. Heads are broken, plots hatched and smashed and manly backs slapped, all to suitably explosive visual backdrops. Ho hum."
2198	2199	How The Riot Club's Sam Claflin became a Buller boy 	npleasantness abounds in , a gruesome feast of deplorability and a vicious, unbridled portrait of privilege. Goldfish are swallowed, whisky is swigged from condoms, bodily fluids are smeared on furniture. One of the more memorable acts of depravity involves an initiation process in which blindfolded newbie Alistair Ryle, played by Sam Claflin, has to quaff some wine and guess the vintage. The catch is that the wine has been spiked with an extinguished cigarette, bogies, phlegm, piss and maggots; Ryle tackles it with vigour. This, though, is the light stuff: university japes, boys being boys. What happens next – both the developing degeneracy, and the political metaphor it stands for – is much, much darker. Directed by An Education’s Lone Scherfig and adapted by Laura Wade from her play Posh, The Riot Club is substantially inspired by Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club, the exclusive dining society whose tailcoated men behaving badly enjoy debauched bacchanalia at the expense of plebs. The film focuses on the annual club dinner, which involves members booking an unsuspecting restaurant, getting wrecked, trashing the place, then paying for the damage without remorse. Bullingdon’s membership between 1987 and 1992 boasted David Cameron, Boris Johnson and George Osborne, in an era so apparently awful that even a former member, David Dimbleby, has denounced the “disgusting, disgraceful things” they did. The now notorious photos of Cameron, Johnson and Osborne in all their preening Bullingdon glory came to light as Wade began working on Posh. Labour were in government, but the new breed of “posh Tory” was on the rise. Although she didn’t want to write about specific people (it’s not “a big stitch-up” she told the Guardian in 2010), she viewed Bullingdon’s destructive college high jinks as a metaphor for what people think they can get away with when they have money or power. Indeed, some might say that the students who once wrecked restaurants are now the people wrecking the country, and with a general election on the way and Johnson going for gold via a safe seat in Uxbridge, the release of the film is meaty food for thought. “Although they are still at university, the boys we are watching are the kind of people who will go on to hold positions of power in various different establishments,” says Wade of her characters. “They are the people who may find themselves high up in government, or banking, or in law. I suppose the question is: how much of who you are when you are that age remains when you are older, or is it just young people getting something out of their system?” This idea is personified by Claflin’s depiction of Ryle, the story’s burgeoning sociopath, who becomes increasingly unhinged as the film progresses. Claflin specifically asked to audition for the character as it was so far removed from the actor’s own experience and morality. “I’m not from that world, not even close,” he says. He describes a research tour around Eton, in which he met students and teachers to get a sense of the milieu. “It was something I could never fathom,” he continues. “I’d never been able to put my finger on how these kids turn out like this or what they go through. But what was really important to me was to portray Alistair as someone we can relate to. Sitting down with Laura and Lone and the cast, there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about how evil Alistair is, and I wanted to show where that dark side comes from. For me, it was about seeing him as a broken-down nobody, then being given a platform. When people are egging you on, you go one step further. Once he gets that power, he starts relishing that side of his personality.” Claflin is an earthy, unassuming sort; even acting hasn’t given him airs and graces. Born in 1986 to an accountant and a classroom assistant, he grew up in Norwich and worked as a paperboy and in Sainsbury’s before getting into drama school. To fund his three years at LAMDA (the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art), he swept the building’s floors. Still, he found a way of processing the elitist snobbery at work in The Riot Club. “This class, these type of boys have never known any different,” he explains. “It’s understandable that they are the way they are because they’ve been given everything in life, and if they have a problem they use money to get out of it. At the opposite end of the spectrum, you have people with no money who have never known any different, so they’ve had to learn to survive by other means.” The British class system may not be as rigid as it once was but Claflin confirms that in certain situations, one is still encouraged to know one’s place. “Only the other day I had one of those Pretty Woman moments when I was dressed casually, walked into a very high-end shop, and had people looking down their noses at me with a ‘You don’t belong in here’ glare,” he says. “Sometimes I find myself buying things for the sake of buying things because I know for a fact that if I try that jumper on and I don’t like it and walk out they’d go, ‘He couldn’t afford it, he looked at the price tag.’ I feel I’m constantly trying to prove to myself that it’s not all about class, it’s not all about the way people dress or talk, or it’s not all about money.” Nonetheless, Claflin’s career ascent has been swift. His first job, straight out of LAMDA, was on the 2010 miniseries The Pillars Of The Earth, and he was then cast in a supporting role in Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. After that he played the prince in Snow White And The Huntsman, and then, boom: the first Hunger Games sequel, in which he played Finnick Odair, a dashing, half-naked former victor who allies with Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss. There are similarities between The Riot Club and The Hunger Games: just as the former can be viewed as a damning indictment of those running the country, the latter makes a good fist of showing kids how power can corrupt, leading to abuse of the masses. Claflin appreciates how the franchise has made politics accessible to its audience, but he is “not in any way overly political” and those themes are not what attracted him. Surely, though, their politics must give him more to chew on than if the films were mere action fantasy? “Yeah, it gives a real depth to every character,” he agrees, and talks of Finnick’s distressing fortunes in the third Hunger Games instalment, Mockingjay: Part 1, which is out in November. “My character especially has been so damaged by the political system and by power that he’s a broken man. The power of the president basically ruined Finnick.” Politics aside, has canonised Claflin in the hearts of its devoted fan army, despite their initial concerns. When his casting was announced, there was dissension: he wasn’t hot enough, they said. Some, bizarrely, even said he was too fat. These days, though, he gets 9,000 retweets for a photo of himself in bed with insomnia. What’s the past year been like, suddenly becoming the apple of hormonal teenage eyes? “What’s great,” he says, “is that each character I’ve played has looked very different, so I’m not walking around with blond hair and my abs out like I am in Hunger Games.” He gets recognised only occasionally: “I kind of live incognito, in a great way.” Indeed, he arrives at our Soho interview looking effortlessly anonymous, rucksack on his back. “I’ve definitely experienced the other end of the spectrum through friends and peers and colleagues who can’t go anywhere, can’t leave the hotel, can’t walk to the bakery, can’t do anything that a normal person would, and it’s really quite a shame,” he adds. “I’m very lucky and thankful that I’m sort of left alone, or not noticed.” With three films out in as many months, he should make the most of that anonymity: between The Riot Club and Mockingjay, October sees him courting Lily Collins in romcom Love, Rosie, by which point those high-end shops will be falling over themselves to get him in their jumpers. It’ll certainly be interesting to see what the Finnick fans make of Claflin’s utter reprehensibility as The Riot Club’s Alistair Ryle. It’s a wretched character, and a truly hateful performance. The Bullingdon boys will probably love it.
2204	2205	A Useful Life – review 	"ore of a delightful hors d'oeuvre than a main course, this monochrome Uruguayan movie centres on the last days of the Cinemateca, an art house cinema in Montevideo. Attendances are falling, the projectors are beyond repair, the rent is in arrears, a sponsor is withdrawing subsidy because the place isn't making a profit and finally an eviction order arrives. It's a moving, pawkily funny movie about the end of an era, not quite the death of cinema, but a change in public taste that makes a certain kind of serious, dedicated cinephilia a thing of the past. Jorge Jellinek, a real-life Uruguayan film critic, plays Jorge, an ungainly, middle-aged bachelor who lives with his elderly father and has been the cinema's devoted manager for 25 years. We see him, a dedicated cineaste to the end, going about his business introducing speakers to small audiences, attending to the books and repairing the seats in one of the shabby auditoriums. In a highly amusing scene, he presents his regular slot on a cultural radio programme promoting the Cinemateca and introducing his colleague, the devoted cineaste Martínez, there to talk about the nature of true cinema. In a flat, didactic manner that shows little concern for the listener, Martínez unwittingly demonstrates one of the reasons the Cinemateca is in trouble, and ignores, or doesn't notice, Jorge's wind-up signals to conclude the talk. Meanwhile, Jorge is attracted to Paola, a youngish, but by no means beautiful professor of law. Sensing she may not entirely share his obsession with cinemas, he sets about improving his appearance, has a shampoo and haircut and proceeds to courting her. Perhaps now he will get a life. But he can't forget the movies, and as he waits for Paola on a university staircase, he dances up and down the steps in homage to James Cagney's scene at the White House in , and hears in his head the ""cavalry to the rescue"" bugle music from . Those who enjoy this elegiac film will enjoy it very much. I did."
2206	2207	Rosario Dawson on her new film Trance – and the father she never knew 	"hen she's on her own and suitably relaxed, you can hypnotise . Eighteen months ago she visited a woman who laid her down, wrapped a blanket up to her neck and started talking. Dawson's thoughts wandered, her temperature dropped and she drifted in and out of sleep: the sweet spot of a trance-like state. The hypnotherapist looked for tells, taking notes of every spasm and twitch. She talked and watched and picked apart what Dawson thought she wanted to explore from what was really on her mind. ""She was reading where I was, subconsciously, from my feet,"" says Dawson, who went through this bout of therapeutic dozing in preparation for her role in the new psychological thriller . ""I was reading in this book, [a body-language manual written by ex-FBI agent Joe Navarro] that your feet are your most honest part of your body. Over everything else. You lie with your face. It's the worst indicator of honesty. And as you go down the body it becomes more and more honest."" Dawson talks in long, fluid bursts. She smiles a lot, maintains eye contact near constantly, but her feet are planted square, saying little. Trance, 's first film since the success of last year's Olympics opening ceremony, is similarly cryptic. Dawson plays Elizabeth Lamb, a hypnotherapist hired by a crime boss ( ) to recover the location of a priceless painting from the mind of an amnesiac fine art dealer ( ). It's a strange film – garish and energised, almost overpoweringly bright: a series of woozy thrills strung together with a line of logic that evaporates after the waking dream is over. It's part , part . It's also the rare film that gives Dawson – hitherto cast as a squeaky clean muse ( ), a tsk-tsk maternal influence ( ), or a frenzied sexpot ( , , ) – the chance to skip between typecasting. The actor, who started a relationship (the couple have reportedly split since), is the film's linchpin. She plays Lamb as a femme fatale who uses her body and mind to manipulate and control. She's not vampishly sexy, nor comically evil. In a story full of violent men, going all in to reveal each other's hands, she is subtle and controlled, the best poker player of the lot. ""As smart as she is, and as understanding as she is about the subconscious and the mind, she's still dealing with very unpredictable characters and situations,"" says Dawson. ""She's constantly thinking on her feet and having to change her strategy. I really liked that. I didn't want to get to the point of being arrogant with her confidence. That nothing ever changed for her and that she was always so perfectly composed – that sort of femme fatale would be boring."" Dawson, born in 1979, is of Native American, Irish, Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban descent and was raised in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Back then, the neighbourhood's gentrification was still a decade away and she lived in a squat refurbished by her mum, a writer and singer, and her adoptive dad, then a construction worker. Her biological father had left after her mum became pregnant with Dawson when she was 17. This, it transpires, is the issue that prompted the trance-state foot-jerking. ""That was the question I had meeting the hypnotherapist,"" she says of her missing parent. ""It was the one I wanted to avoid asking, but it was still kind of there. I wonder if part of [this film] has been the landscape for finally being ready to ask the question?"" Hypnotherapy planted the seed of an idea, but it was Dawson's dabbling in another class of mind game that let the suggestion take hold. ""I did a session with a psychic,"" she says. ""She was really bold. She told me that my dad was dead and was speaking to me from beyond the grave. And I was like: 'I don't know if you're a good psychic, or if you're just pulling my leg – because I don't know this fact.' That was really wild. ""I'm so curious about stuff. I will research a character to the umpteenth degree. And yet there's this big gaping question mark in my own personal life that I have not looked at."" A few months ago, she hired an investigator, a $500-a-job guy who had helped a friend in a similar situation. He's already coming back with results. ""We think he died in 2001,"" she says. ""If he passed, I'm sad about that, but in some ways I think I'm slightly relieved. It's Pandora's box you're opening. And I think it would have been weird to have to feel like I need to create a relationship later. As an adult if you were lwhat's the point of doing that unless you're wanting to create something?"" Dawson doesn't find it too painful to think about the death of a father she never knew, because she never felt as if something was missing. She had a dad: , the man who married her mum when she was pregnant (the pair have since separated). Rosario describes Greg as ""a hero"" (""he chose me and wanted me""). And she's not worried that her search for her biological father will upset him. ""He met him,"" she says. ""He knew him. Apparently he [her biological father] had come into my life when I was four – no one thought to take a photo. My mum always said it was two weeks. I talked to my dad and he was like: 'No, it was a good month. He came over and you guys spent a lot of time together. You were so excited about having two daddies.' ""I was four, so I don't really remember any of that, but it was just nice that all these other stories came up . Curious things. This blurry figure starts to get crystallised."" It is because of Greg that Dawson got into acting at all. Her career was jumpstarted in the summer of 1994, when Vibe magazine was shooting a commercial on her block. Greg told her to go downstairs and get discovered. So the 15-year-old hung out on her stoop, shyly ogling her first crush: a grip (""His name was Michael Denzel, if I remember rightly"") who was working on the shoot. ""He wore the exact same outfit for three days straight,"" she says. ""It was disgusting actually, I should not have had a crush on him. But he was the reason I didn't just get bored and fuck off. I was hoping to get discovered by him to a certain extent."" So she sat, hoping Denzel was watching, when another man – homeless, long hair, bright blue eyes – approached and asked her if there was any room in the squat. They struck up a conversation, but Rosario was up on the step and this man was six feet down on the street. He was mumbling and laughing to himself and Dawson couldn't hear him but she was laughing when he laughed, trying to read his body language. ""I didn't know what he was talking about,"" she says. ""I remember thinking: 'This guy looks like Jesus and I'm humouring Jesus.' I thought that was the funniest thing. So suddenly I just guffaw-laughed. Probably really obnoxiously. And this group of people turned and started staring at me."" Among them was photographer and the writer and future film director . Clark, 52 at the time, had recruited 19-year-old Korine to write a teenage Aids story set in the New York skate scene. They were scouting for locations for the film that would become , one of the most controversial films of the 1990s, thanks to its frank (some would say irresponsible) depiction of teenage sex. Clark and Korine immediately took a shine to the girl laughing on her front step. They introduced themselves and (after checking with Greg) Dawson agreed to read for them. She was given the part of Ruby, and spent four days playing the straight-talking running buddy to character, an HIV-positive teen who spends the film trying to find her ex and warn him about her diagnosis. Kids was a hit at the following year's Sundance film festival, catapulting Sevigny and Dawson into the limelight. ""It just seemed like this nothing thing,"" says Dawson. ""Four days, one film and a high school theatre 101 class later, I have an agent and a movie out in theatres and I'm auditioning. And it's been my life ever since."" Since Kids you can roll the dice on the quality of a Rosario Dawson film. An appearance in Spike Lee's He Got Game (and a powerful turn in Lee's under-rated ) suggested she might make the jump to arthouse icon, as did. But those more challenging roles – along with intense turns in small, self-produced movies such as 2007's Descent (Dawson plays a college student who enacts brutal revenge on her rapist) – tend to get blindsided by second- or third-fiddle parts in bigger, blander fare. You may not remember her in Men in Black II or Pluto Nash, but she's there, bringing the energy, playing the game, clocking up the credits. Part of the problem could be Dawson's looks: she's very beautiful. It's the first thing her co-star, Vincent Cassel, talks about when I mention her. ""Years ago there was a director who asked me: 'If we cast a female lead – and knowing that you have to have this love affair with her – who would you like to kiss?'"" he says. ""There were three actresses. And she was definitely one of them."" (The second was his wife, Monica Bellucci. He won't reveal the third – he doesn't want to jinx it.) He's being charming, but it's telling where his focus lies. Still, Dawson doesn't seem too perturbed. ""I've tried to fight against it at certain times in my career,"" she says. ""Looks are fleeting, you know? Your face can change, or something could happen to me. And I don't want to feel like that's all I have to give, because that would be very fragile"". Plus there are worse things to be than very good-looking in the acting business. And you imagine she has a backup plan. All that reading about hypnosis? All the work clocking body language and decodifying behaviour? Could she fall back on hypnotherapy if the parts dry up? ""It is kind of seductive to think about learning it,"" she says. ""Even if it was for an occasional trick at a party"". She whispers: ""I know what you're thinking … you're getting sleepy …"""
2213	2214	Philip French's classic DVD: Thelma & Louise 	idley Scott's masterly road movie was a feminist thriller in the Cormanesque exploitation style but with a much bigger budget and greater poise. Ditzy, put-upon lower-middle-class housewife Thelma (Geena Davis) and her chum, tough cafe waitress Louise (Susan Sarandon), take off from their Arkansas small town in Louise's 1966 Thunderbird for a weekend's fishing. But when Louise kills Thelma's would-be rapist they go on the run, heading for Mexico. To a possible murder charge they add armed robbery, kidnapping a policeman and massive destruction of property. The only decent man around is a sympathetic cop played by Harvey Keitel. It's a film that appeals to the outlaw in all of us, with a freeze-frame reminiscent of . Pursuing a recurrent theme in his work (dutiful citizens rebelling against the conventional values in which they've been raised), Scott's movie stands alongside and . Strong supporting performances come from rising stars Brad Pitt and Michael Madsen. Callie Khouri won an Oscar for her original screenplay, her only work of note to date.
2223	2224	Tony Curtis: 'The king of cool is on his way up, with syrup' 	"The film world has been paying tribute after news of 's death at the age of 85, at home in Las Vegas. The Clark County coroner reported Curtis had a cardiac arrest. In his as a film actor, Curtis met and worked with almost everyone who was anyone in Hollywood's glory years, from James Stewart in Winchester 73 to Robert de Niro in The Last Tycoon. In between he was directed by the likes of Douglas Sirk, Stanley Kubrick and Billy Wilder. He married Janet Leigh and they were the golden couple of the early 50s before divorcing in 1962. In a prepared statement Curtis's daughter with Leigh, Jamie Lee Curtis, said: ""My father leaves behind a legacy of great performances in movies and in his paintings and assemblages. He leaves behind children and their families who loved him and respected him and a wife and in-laws who were devoted to him. He also leaves behind fans all over the world."" Tributes have come pouring in for Curtis, even if his acting career diminished in quality and quantity after its 1960s heyday. Sir Roger Moore, who acted with him in the TV series The Persuaders in the early 70s, said: ""We had a lot of laughs together for about 15 months, working together every day. He was great fun to work with, a great sense of humour and wonderful ad libs. We had the best of times."" Because of his colourful personality and reputation as a carouser, Curtis became a popular chat show guest. Sir said: ""He was an extraordinary man. Hollywood tried to make him into a sex symbol in the 1950s and 1960s but he was his own man. He was wonderfully indiscreet but he was very bright and did not take himself too seriously."" Although they never made a film together, Curtis and Sir became good friends. Caine said: ""When his time as a leading man was over he went off to Hawaii and painted. He had a very happy life. Every time I saw him he was the happiest man you could think of."" The Twitterverse went into meltdown, with Curtis's death following those of legendary director Arthur Penn and US comic Greg Giraldo. Marcgellen wrote: ""Last of the great old school Hollywood actors, what a cool guy"", while nixonshepherd tweeted: ""Classically handsome, unabashedly charismatic & sincerely genuine ... the bygone traits of Hollywood's golden age."" Laserblue summed it up best : ""Step aside Steve McQueen, the real king of cool is on his way up, with syrup."""
2227	2228	Cannes 2014: Timbuktu review – searing fundamentalist drama 	"bderrahmane Sissako's passionate and visually beautiful film Timbuktu is a cry from the heart – with all the more moral authority for being expressed with such grace and such care. It is a portrait of the country of his childhood, the west African state of Mali, and in particular the city of Timbuktu, whose rich and humane traditions are being trampled, as Sissako sees it, by fanatical jihadis, often from outside the country. The story revolves around the death of a cow, affectionately named ""GPS"" – an appropriate symbol for a country that has lost its way. These Islamist zealots are banning innocent pleasures such as music and football, and throwing themselves with cold relish into lashings and stonings for adultery. The new puritans appal the local imam, who has long upheld the existing traditions of a benevolent and tolerant Islam; they march into the mosque carrying arms. Besides being addicted to cruelty and bullying, these men are enslaved to their modern devices – mobile phones, cars, video-cameras (for uploading jihadi videos to the internet) and, of course, weapons. is no longer , the magical place of legend, but a harsh, grim, unforgiving place of bigotry and fear. Sissako creates an interrelated series of characters and tableaux giving us scenes from the life of a traumatised nation, historically torn apart and prone to failures in communication between its three languages: Touareg, Arabic and French. At the centre of this is the tragic story of one family: a herdsman Kidane (Ibrahim Ahmed), his wife Satima (Toulou Kiki) and their 12-year-old daughter. Kidane angrily confronts a fisherman who has killed his cow, with tragic results. Mali's new theocratic state must now rule on something that has nothing to do with infringements of its own proliferating religious laws – and its crass insensitivity and immaturity as a system of government is horribly exposed. There are some brilliant visual moments: the panoramic vision of the river in which Kidane and the fisherman stagger apart, at different ends of the screen, is superb, composed with a panache that David Lean might have admired. When a jihadi comes close to admitting he is infatuated with Satima, Sissako shows us the undulating dunes with a strategically placed patch of scrub. It is a sudden, Freudian vision of a woman's naked body, which is then made the subject of a bizarre, misogynist attack. Elsewhere, young men carry on playing football after football has been banned by miming the game. They rush around the field with an invisible football, earnestly playing a match by imagining where the ball should be. It is a funny, sly, heartbreaking scene, reminiscent of anti-Soviet satire. In another scene, a young man is being coached on how to describe his religious conversion for a video (for an awful moment, it looks as if it might be a suicide-bomber ""martyrdom"" video). The boy talks about how he used to love rap music, but no longer. Yet in the face of the hectoring and maladroit direction, the boy lowers his head: he finds he cannot mouth these dogmatic platitudes. In many ways, Sissako's portrait of Mali is comparable to Ibrahim El-Batout's portrait of Egypt and the Tahrir Square protests in his film Winter of Discontent. It is built up with enormous emotion, teetering between hope and despair."
2228	2229	Grace of Monaco review: Cannes opens with a royal biopic worse than Diana 	"It's traditional for Cannes to start with something spectacular. This is certainly no exception. It is a film so awe-inspiringly wooden that it is basically a fire-risk. The cringe-factor is ionospherically high. A fleet of ambulances may have to be stationed outside the Palais to take tuxed audiences to hospital afterwards to have their toes uncurled under general anaesthetic. is a stately and swooning homage to Princess Grace, formerly Grace Kelly, focusing on her alleged courage in keeping plucky little Monaco safe for tax-avoiding billionaires. This was during its supremely parochial and uninteresting 1962 face-off with Charles De Gaulle, who wanted to absorb the principality and its monies into France's national bosom. So can Grace, by finally sacrificing her movie career on the altar of this cockamamie Ruritanian state, and flaunting her martyred couture loveliness, win the respect of the Monégasque folk and even the grumpy old Général himself? The resulting film about this fantastically boring crisis is like a 104-minute Chanel ad, only without the subtlety and depth. Princess Grace herself is played by Nicole Kidman, wafting around the Palace with dewy-eyed features and slightly parted lips which make her look like a grown-up Bambi after a couple of cocktails, suddenly remembering his mother's violent death in the forest. It doesn't seem that long since we endured a horrendous biopic of Princess , that other super-rich blonde pasionaria — played by Naomi Watts. As audiences reeled into the foyer after that, they comforted themselves with the thought that surely things couldn't get worse. Surely they wouldn't be forced to endure another badly acted, badly directed film about a wealthy and self-pitying royal? How very wrong. I can now actually imagine a creepy science-fiction short story about someone going back to prehistoric days in a time machine, killing a tiny trilobite, and then coming to the present to find everything the same, only now it's Naomi Watts playing Grace and playing Diana. The movie begins with a sketch of jowly and adorable old Alfred Hitchcock (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) coming to Monaco hoping to tempt Grace back to the movies, proffering a juicy leading role in his latest film, Marnie. Two recent dramas about Hitchcock's troubled life — one for cinema, a better one for TV — have in fact begun in approximately the same way, but then followed the troubled director back to the US. Here, we stay with Kidman's Grace, who is effectively confronted by a dilemma. Should she return to her selfish, shallow life in Hollywood or build a new shallow, selfish life in Monte Carlo? And so the terrible mental turmoil begins. She pores over the script, late at night, in bed, with stylish reading glasses. During the day, she tries her darnedest to impress the wittering ladies of Monaco by entering into the spirit of charity galas and such. She worries about plotting against her at court. She consults her confidant, one Father Francis Tucker, a sorrowing priest who is evidently permitted the familiarity of calling her ""Gracie"", played with conviction by . Then, in order to bone up on the history and culture of Monaco — and perhaps because the situation is not yet sufficiently gay — Grace consults a local nobleman, Count Fernando D'Aillieres, played by . He scampers about the hillsides, with Grace in tow, filling her in on all the tiresome details, while also presuming to give her tips on acting and deportment. (Surely as an Oscar-winning star she knows this stuff already?) Jacobi has a little fun with the part, although it needed Ian McKellen to come on, playing the Count's ageing houseboy. But how about the people for whom it is all supposed to be about? Her, erm, husband and children? Well, the absolute indifference shown by Grace to her kids here is startling. And what of Prince Rainier himself, that fairy-tale prince for whom she gave it all up? He is played by Tim Roth, who gives a very cigarette-smoking, glasses-wearing, moustache-having performance. He is always leaning in his chair, leaning against door frames — looking through his glasses, and smoking. What is this remarkable head of state thinking about? As performed by Tim Roth, it looks like he is thinking about how much he regrets taking this appalling role, and how inadequate he considers his fee, whatever it is. An interesting, complex film could be made about a talented woman who decides to make the best of being trapped in an imperfect marriage. But such a film would have to stop curtsying, and really think about its subject."
2229	2230	Mike Leigh on Mr Turner: ‘He was an enigmatic character – conflicted. He was so driven. He never stopped’ 	any times over the past decade and in the middle of making other films , – Mike Leigh and his cinematographer, Dick Pope, would look at the sky and then at one another and say: “Oh God, we must make our Turner film.” A particular light, a moment’s radiance, a sunset – any of these might set them off. The idea of making a film about this country’s greatest painter, Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775–1851), in his last quarter century came to Leigh at the end of the 1990s and would not let him go. The difficulty, as always, was finding the funding. “But then recently we decided we’d go all out for it, and so we did.” Mr Turner is the outstanding result, a film that introduces the painter as a portly fellow with a top hat and a curmudgeonly expression in repose. Not that repose was Turner’s thing (there are more than 20,000 works in the Tate’s Clore collection alone). In the film, he travels the land and seashore, his painter’s kit slung over one shoulder. His is a solitary calling, and it is clear he needs the love of a good woman – anchorage. Turner is played by , who has already received the Cannes best actor award for a tremendous and disconcerting performance. For those who know little about Turner’s life, it’s a jolt to accept that the creator of paintings of genius was a faulty bloke with an intermittently uncivil tongue, a tendency to grunt and a contradictory attitude towards women. It is hard, on one level, to believe his sublime canvases come with a character attached at all. But the film tells the human story splendidly, and makes a companion piece to Tate Britain’s breathtaking exhibition, . I have not met before, although we’ve spoken on the phone, yet it’s like encountering an old friend or a relative (he can be slightly avuncular). But the main reason for the sense of familiarity is that one picks up so many clues about him from his films and plays: his liberal intelligence, satirical edge, good heart. I had been given unusually detailed instructions about how to find him in his Soho offices – as if he were in hiding rather than at work: “It looks a little unlikely but don’t be deterred, you’re in the right place. Just follow the stairs up to the poster and knock on the white door to the left… ” And once inside, life does seem fairly sweet. We are in a room with Georgian windows that face on to the street. The atmosphere is friendly rather than professional, as if a sitting room had been transported from Mike Leigh’s home and plonked down in Soho. It seems in keeping with his film-making style that there is no razzmatazz about Thin Man Films’s headquarters. Leigh is not so much a thin man as koala-bearish. He is beady-eyed, bearded and has a robust laugh. By far the most striking thing about him is his curiosity. I do not think I’ve ever met anyone more watchful, interested or quicker to turn an answer into a question. And he is not at all self-involved – he prefers to focus outwards. His beginnings can be outlined at speed: he was born in 1943 into a Jewish immigrant family (Leigh was originally Lieberman), the son of a GP. He grew up in Manchester, and even by the age of 14 he was into art. Does he remember his first encounter with Turner’s painting? “I had postcards of Picasso, the impressionists and even – dare I admit it – Salvador Dalí (I got over that). But Turner, Constable – I thought they were boring landscapes for chocolate boxes or biscuit-tin lids. I didn’t notice Turner until I was at Camberwell art school in the early 60s, when I started thinking about figurative painting. You couldn’t be a London art student and go around galleries without starting to ‘get’ Turner. But the scope, scale and remarkableness of his work has taken its time.” Later, he spells Turner’s importance out: ‘This guy was a revolutionary, anticipating the impressionists and 20th-century art – anticipating Rothko probably – and yet he was timeless.” Leigh mentions Camberwell – had he wanted to be a painter himself? “No, I wanted to direct and make films and write. To do that I went to Rada, acted for a short while in films, went to Camberwell on the foundation course, then to the theatre design course at the Central and to the London Film School at the same time. I did all those things in order to do what I do.” It sounds intensive – was Camberwell useful? “Very. It was curious in that it was the only thing I was doing that was not directly related to theatre or film. You did painting, pottery, sculpture, lithography, lettering, art history and, above all, life drawing – which was immensely good news. I might have gone to art school and wound up an illustrator or painter; my son is an illustrator – . I found art school immensely stimulating in contrast to Rada, which at that time – and I stress this is absolutely no longer the case – was dead. It was Rada at its most superficial and old-fashioned: you just learned the lines and tried not to fall over the furniture.” Then he says: “I remember standing in a life-drawing class towards the end of the year, in the summer of 1964, in what had been a Peckham infant school now used as an annexe. It was a room with about 20 kids in it. There was a great working atmosphere, it was intense, there was a commitment, something going on… I remember looking around the room and thinking: we never experience this at drama school, for one second, because here everyone is looking at something real and finding a way of expressing it. And that meshed with thoughts I had on the go about the possibility of what actors could do, and film-making and making theatre in an organic way.” It amounts almost to a manifesto: looking at something real and finding a way of expressing it. What Leigh is famous for is creating films that evolve through research, conversation and improvisation ranging from Beverly, the grotesque suburban diva (played by Alison Steadman, Leigh’s first wife), in to back-street abortionist Vera Drake (played by Imelda Staunton) or to Hortense in , a young adopted black woman (played by ) who goes in search of her birth mother. None of these films would have been possible without Leigh’s gift for scrutiny. It is the mix of watchfulness, dedication and unpredictability (the atmosphere of the art class) that informs his films and plays. But with the Turner film, wasn’t he in danger of being hobbled by art history? Or could he still approach the film in his usual way? is, after all, not Leigh’s first departure from fiction. In 1999 he made , about Gilbert and Sullivan. “Normally, everybody goes out and discovers from scratch what the film is, whereas here you start with a fixed set of premises.” They were assisted on the film by , an art historian specialising in 18th- and 19th-century painting who has worked at the Tate and was, for two years, a paid member of the team. The cast read and researched as much as possible (Leigh singles out James Hamilton’s biography and as starting points). They were given talks at the Royal Academy and the Tate, where they went backstage and were granted free access to the Turner archive. But do not be misled: Leigh’s fidelity to historical fact has not watered down his methods: it has been showbusiness as usual. “You can research and read for a million years and a zillion books, but it doesn’t make it happen in front of a camera. Everyone knows Turner went to the Royal Academy in 1832, on varnishing day [a sociable day just before the opening of a show to the public, which was a sort of unofficial private view, when artists gave their work a final lick and a promise, a coat of extra varnish at the very least], and put this red blob on a grey painting next to Constable’s, then turned it into a buoy and Constable said, ‘He has fired a gun’ and walked out. And that is fine, you can read that, but you’ve still got to make it happen and explore it on screen.” And Leigh does explore it as Turner shockingly adds his scarlet daub to the seascape as if he were vandalising his own work – until, with targeted panache, he turns the blob into a recognisable buoy. We see James Fleet’s dismayed Constable, fearing his own wings have been permanently clipped. “We did a massive amount of improvisation informed by what we had read and what we knew had to be dramatised,” Leigh says, and adds that the actors were all painters themselves: “We went out of our way to say, ‘OK, where are the actors who can paint?’ There are quite a lot of them around. They didn’t all get into the film because some of them can’t act, but the ones that could act and paint were there.” Timothy Spall has “always had an amateur notion of doodling” and studied with Timothy Wright, a “very good teacher” whose was in BP’s portrait exhibition this year. But the image-making in the film was a challenge, not least because one of the oddities about Turner, as Leigh explains, is that if you compare portraits of him, he looks different in each one. I check online and it’s true: in , at the National Portrait Gallery, he has uncommonly hairy black eyebrows, a receding hairline and a beaky nose. , its features fair and balanced. The Wass portrait, after Henry Raeburn, shows a young man with blue, marble-like eyes. “And if you look at the statue in the Royal Academy in Piccadilly, it doesn’t look like anything you know.” In the Tate’s exhibition, an 1846 oil by , shows a top-heavy man bristling with brushes, with grey sideburns and short legs. “He was a much smaller man than Tim Spall but I decided not to worry about that.” Dick Pope was honoured at Cannes with a technical award for his cinematography for bringing the paintings to life: the film is filled with Turneresque colour: rose, amber, palest blue… “It’s interesting,” Leigh says, “that this is the first full-length film we have made with a digital camera. If you take this tool and embrace it rather than whinge, it’s amazing what you can do. And that includes what you can do in post-production. Do you like the concocted scene where you see ?” I do, I reply. This was Turner’s 1838 painting of a gunship that fought boldly in the Battle of Trafalgar. In the film, Turner takes to the water to witness its destruction. Watching the movie, one cannot help but wonder what other liberties might have been taken. I read aloud a list of suspect details: did Turner actually welcome patrons into a candlelit antechamber so that when they were released into his studio, the luminous canvases would seem more brilliant? Did he spy on patrons and watch their reactions through a peephole? And did he, as a dying man, say: “The sun is God”? To my surprise, the answer to all these is: yes. “I don’t know if I’m good enough to have invented such things,” Leigh says, as though to himself. And yes, Turner spat at his own canvases to enhance them: “He blew mysterious brown powder at them too.” Snuff? “Nobody knows… ” There are three instances in the film where Leigh parts company with biographical fact or seeks imaginatively to extend it. “It is now disputed that Turner had himself strapped to the mast of a ship in order to paint a storm. He claimed he did, but people doubted it.” From Leigh’s point of view it was too dramatic to leave out: “We’re making a movie... ” And while Turner’s relationship with his father is known to have been close, there is no evidence that it was as demonstrative (lively kisses on the cheeks) as in the film. But the boldest dramatic licence is in proposing that Turner’s relationship with Hannah Danby, his housekeeper (played by Dorothy Atkinson) was sexual. It is possible but there is no firm evidence: “This grew organically out of rehearsal,” Leigh says. We watch Turner clawing at her, helping himself to her, as though a woman were necessary yet insignificant as a slice of bread. “Hannah stayed Turner and his father’s housekeeper for 40 years and was still there at the end.” Turner also had an estranged mistress, Sarah Danby (Ruth Sheen) – Hannah’s aunt – with whom he had daughters, and who in the film “fumes with grievances against him”. Turner hasn’t much time for either of the Danbys. “He was an enigmatic character – conflicted. He had a great capacity for emotion, for warmth and compassion, but at the same time was so driven by his project. He never stopped. We know he went to brothels, had a dysfunctional relationship with Sarah Danby and was in denial about his daughters.” Leigh tries to let Turner off the hook. He says that while he and I would never dream of failing to acknowledge our own children, he believes Turner was too preoccupied to think about them. It is a third woman, Mrs Booth, who is at the heart of the film. She was Turner’s Margate landlady, a widow who became his dearly beloved, and with whom he went to live, in secret, in Chelsea. The tender regard between Turner and Mrs Booth in the film is what has been missing from his other relationships with women. Their alliance is as heartwarming as the marriage between Jim Broadbent’s Tom and Ruth Sheen’s Gerri in Leigh’s (2010). One notes with surprised approval the cheery focus in Leigh’s recent work on the loving relationships of an older generation. There is a marvellous moment in the film when Turner looks directly at Mrs Booth and tells her: “You are a woman of profound beauty”, and you can see this makes her twice-married, 60-plus heart flutter, although she knows enough about the world to stay steady. She is superbly played with sparkling charm and warmth by Marion Bailey. I raise the subject of Bailey, who has been in three Leigh movies: , and . I once met her and she told me she used jokingly to refer to Leigh’s narrative interventions as “acts of God”. But I had been planning to ask him about her for another reason. I remember him telling me, in 2010, that he regarded Bailey as an exceptional actress who had not been feted as she deserved. I remind him of this, and praise her performance as Mrs Booth. And I suddenly notice that he is unable to disguise his pleasure: “Well, of course, the truth is I’m very biased because she is my partner, in fact. I am very biased indeed about this.” And so he feels he cannot say anything about her brilliance? “No, no, no, I can say it, from the bottom of my heart, because it’s true, you know.” Turner needed Mrs Booth’s sweetness in later life, when his work was subjected to mortifying hostility. “Some people are lucky enough to have someone to look after them,” Leigh broods. “Mrs Booth did not really know who Turner was, she knew nothing about painting.” And this must have been soothing for the great man. John Ruskin, who had championed Turner in his first book, , dismissed the late work – universally revered now – as proof of failing powers. In the film, there is a killingly funny vignette in which Joshua McGuire’s Ruskin, who cannot pronounce his Rs, purrs with self-satisfaction at his own ideas – the critic who got the cream. Leigh seems to be promoting the idea that criticism is generally irrelevant? He looks sheepish and laughs: “Look, were one to say Ruskin’s entire view were beside the point, it would be outrageous – ludicrous. However, we know he was a prude and I perceive him, to a certain degree, as a prick and smug and that is where we start. Look, we know Ruskin looked after Turner’s estate and is said – although it is now disputed by some academics – to have gone in and burnt erotic drawings he saw as pornography. Ruskin was raised by over-protective parents. He was encouraged to have pompous opinions at an early age; his mother actually went to Cambridge with him while he was at university. He was very cosseted, and that is what we captured. There are times when what he has to say is profound, but I thought: this is too good a trick to miss.” Watching the film, it is impossible not to have a sneaking suspicion that is, at least in part, autobiographical, or, at the very least, that it involves sympathetic projection, that it reflects Leigh himself. A 71-year-old film-maker considering a 76-year-old painter. They are, after all, in love with the same woman. But would Leigh have got on with Turner? “It is a question with no answer except that in the course of one’s many years on this planet, I am sure I have known various kinds of bohemian people. And of artistic, creative outsiders, so I think that probably I would be capable of getting on with him, but no question is more academic than that one.” He is grumbling benignly, like Turner in the film. But I’m pleased with his answer, coming as it does as late Leigh and late Turner collide.
2231	2232	William Hague found unlikely role as co-star in humanitarian campaign 	"It would have taken a bold scriptwriter to have imagined the arc of William Hague's four-year career as foreign secretary. He arrived in office with the image of a stolid traditionalist, suffered some early wounding setbacks but emerged at the end of it as a pioneering campaigner in partnership with one of the most glamorous film stars on the planet. Hague and Angelina Jolie's joint global campaign to bring an end to the use of mass rape as a weapon of war has been one of the most surprising double acts in political history. Jolie brought with her dazzling fame but also the reputation for risk-taking and danger in her private life. Hague is cautious, decidedly untrendy and deliberate, occasionally plodding in style. Just how much impact they will have on the epidemic of sexual violence on the world's battlefields will not be clear for years, but with a well-attended summit last month, they appear to have put the issue on the global agenda. Officials insist the campaign will continue after Hague leaves the Foreign Office. Any such legacy would have seemed unlikely in September 2010, just four months after Hague became foreign secretary, when he was fending off rumours of having had an affair with a young special adviser with a deeply personal statement about his struggle to start a family. Five months later, the Foreign Office was in the news again for all the wrong reasons. Planes sent to evacuate Britons after civil war broke out in Libya broke down, leaving some 500 stranded while other nations appeared to be successfully extricating their citizens. The malfunction of the plane was not the Foreign Office's fault but questions began to be asked about Hague's future in office. He responded in various ways. He became considerably less accessible to the press than any of his predecessors, certainly much less available than his Labour immediate predecessor, David Miliband. But whereas Miliband was seeking to rise further in his party, Hague had no ambitions for the top job. He had already had an unhappy stint as leader of the opposition. A side-effect of this reaction, however, was to make the Foreign Office as a whole a less transparent institution, its officials less confident about explaining foreign policy. At the same time, Hague went about building up the institution, which was in retreat and in deep financial trouble when he arrived. He was able to change the budget practice whereby the Foreign Office bore all the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and was able to ward off the worst of the budget cuts. By the end of his time in office he will have overseen the opening of 20 new embassies, high commissions and consulates, as well as a language school and a diplomatic academy. In 2012, he unveiled a new crisis centre in the basement of the Foreign Office for the co-ordination of overseas rescues, aimed at avoiding a repeat of the previous year's Libyan fiasco. Hague's most radical departure and possibly his most enduring legacy, however, was to use the Foreign Office as a launch pad for a global campaign. He had set out as a foreign secretary in search of a cause, inspired by one of his political heroes, the anti-slavery campaigner, William Wilberforce, whose biography he wrote, and he found it when one of his advisers showed him the 2011 film Jolie had made about the rape camps in the Bosnian war, Land of Blood and Honey. Their joint Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative involved drawing up a new international protocol, laying out standards for the investigation and prosecution of rape in conflict, currently rampant in Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. At the June summit in London's Docklands, 117 countries formally signed the protocol. Britain also pushed for military training around the world, especially for prospective UN peacekeeping troops, to include elements aimed at spotting and preventing the incidence of mass rape by armed groups. In committing the machinery of British diplomacy to the promotion of that cause, Hague may have created a more feasible model for UK foreign policy than the institutional obsession with ""punching above our weight"" by sticking as close to possible to Washington and vying to be the second biggest troop contributor in foreign adventures. Although that remains a bulwark of foreign policy doctrine, Hague, a fierce Atlanticist himself, may have set an alternative, shrugging off the last delusions of imperial greatness, finding a humanitarian cause to lead, in which even a middling power like Britain can make a difference."
2243	2244	Ukip will win Rochester and Strood byelection, says Douglas Carswell 	, the newly elected Ukip MP, has said that he expects his new party to win the Rochester and Strood byelection, adding it was possible that Ukip could win as many as 24 seats at the general election in light of polls showing it could take 25% of the vote next May. He said he would not indulge in bravado talk but added that things “could be very different” if Ukip won Rochester and that centre-left voters were starting to come his party’s way. He also hinted that a MP was willing to defect. Austin Mitchell, the 80-year-old MP for Grimsby, has denied he is the possible defector. Mitchell, a long-term Eurosceptic, is standing down next May, and has previously denied he will join Ukip. Carswell was speaking on Sunday amid a round of interviews follow last week’s byelections. , the London mayor, responded to the Ukip surge by saying it was axiomatic that the Conservatives would campaign to leave the EU if the UK cannot negotiate concessions with Brussels on the free movement of peoples across Europe. Labour’s deputy leader, Harriet Harman, also rejected suggestions there were any “wobbles” over Ed Miliband’s leadership, as party officials insisted the key lesson from Thursday’s byelections was that David Cameron no longer has a strategy to win a majority at the next election. Labour said it would not be shifting ground to curtail the free movement of workers within the EU, but would say more, on its own timetable, about the trio of immigration issues of integration, exploitation and contributions. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, admitted Labour had not gained extra votes in the way that it hoped in Heywood and Stourbridge byelection on Thursday. He conceded immigration was an issue, but added: “Ukip want to take their bat off the field and leave us powerless.” Carswell said he was not interested in bravado, adding he wanted a humane immigration policy based on humanity and common sense. The former Tory insisted that his new party was offering an optimistic vision of the UK’s future. “I think it’s important to remember that Ukip is not the Conservative party in exile; I’ve got good friends in the Conservative party and I’ve also got good friends in other parties,” he said. “If people who want change, and perhaps if they want to be true to the principles of Keir Hardie [Labour’s first leader], there is a party they can look to and a party that reflects the values of those who went into politics to improve the lives of their constituents.” Carswell also highlighted a more liberal tone than Ukip’s leader, Nigel Farage, saying no one was seriously suggesting screening immigrants for HIV. Farage only “quality” EU citizens without life threatening diseases, such as HIV or cancer, could be let into the UK, but later added they might be permitted to enter if they could prove they would pay for their own medical treatment. Carswell said: “The way the Tory party is retailing politics is a bit like the way HMV retailed music: it’s a defunct retail model. The Conservative party should be more like Spotify but the Conservative party can’t change and won’t change because there are too many vested interests that are against recall of MPs, open primaries, direct democracy and change. Why? Because if we had direct democracy many of the members of the Conservative party and the leadership would be replaced.” Speaking against the backdrop of one poll by Survation showing Ukip on 25%, Johnson said he did not believe EU partners would recoil in horror at British demands for renegotiation of free movement and the introduction of a points-based system linked to skills. He told the BBC1’s Andrew Marr show: “You cannot go into negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away so it follows that if you do not get the right solution then you need a better solution. I would certainly say there is nothing to fear in this argument and everything to gain.” He said Ukip was making gains among the electorate “because voters felt they were not being given a proper choice”. Johnson added that the original EU vision was first outlined when there were far fewer member states with similar wage rates. “The principle of uniformity across the [fatherland] has already been breached in our case pointing out that the UK already had different border arrangements through the Schengen agreement,” he said. Johnson, who is standing as Conservative candidate in Uxbridge, said people were too apprehensive about the possible downsides of leaving the EU. He conceded that some business would be apprehensive in the first phase after Britain’s exit, but he said he doubted many would leave the EU, pointing out the same warnings were made if the UK did not join the euro. The mayor said London had powered on outside the eurozone, adding that the city it continued to have great attractions. Johnson insisted the should not panic in the face of a defeat in Rochester and Strood byelection. He rejected talk of local pacts between Ukip and Tory sceptic MPs, saying the whole revolt against Westminster was based on a belief that Westminster is a stitch-up. “I don’t see how that works, No.”
2245	2246	Whiskers to a screen 	Topsy-Turvy (160 mins, 12). Directed by Mike Leigh; starring Jim Broadbent, Allan Corduner, Ron Cook, Lesley Manville At the beginning of Chariots of Fire, the future Olympic sprinter Harold Abrahams passes the Cambridge University Fabian Society's recruiting booth at a freshmen's fair to sign up with the University's Society. No doubt feels that with his socially realistic plays and films over the past 30 years, he has paid his Fabian dues and can turn his attention to Gilbert and Sullivan with a clear conscience. Not that Topsy-Turvy represents a radical change of direction for him. For it's about the kind of collaborative theatrical enterprise Leigh loves and the kind of eccentricity, English and otherwise, to which he has always been attached. Unlike Launder and Gilliat's 1952 movie, The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan, Topsy-Turvy is not a conventional biopic and doesn't touch on the absurd break-up of their partnership over the Savoy Theatre's carpets in the 1890s. Instead, it concen trates on the 15-month period between the first night of Princess Ida in January 1884 and the first night of The Mikado in March 1885. Both were triumphant occasions and the film is an opulently mounted, warm-hearted celebration of two great artists and of a dedicated group of actors, backstage personnel and front-of-house figures working together at the D'Oyly Carte Company. But this being a Mike Leigh picture, it isn't triumphalist in tone. All the performers have their professional worries, and in the case of the singer and future co-author of The Diary of a Nobody, George Grossmith (the excellent Martin Savage), the additional problem of being a morphine addict. Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), on the point of building the Savoy Hotel with profits from the Savoy Operas, fears that his two golden geese might split up. An unexpectedly hot summer brings the run of Princess Ida to an untimely end and The Sorcerer is hastily revived to fill the gap. Above all, W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and Sir Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner), despite being the most successful authors of comic operas in the world, are racked by doubt and discontent. The smooth, socially conscious Sullivan has been knighted by the queen and is courted by the aristocracy, but he wants to write serious music for the concert hall and the opera house, not make audiences laugh. Gilbert, a natural malcontent from a broken home, neither of whose parents take an interest in his work, wants to be taken seriously as a comic writer. He considers being called 'the King of Topsy-Turvydom' by the Times an insult. Both actors look the part, down to the last well-coiffed Victorian whisker, and they provide rich, three-dimensional portraits. The privately sybaritic Sullivan has a devoted mistress in London and likes to 'take exercise' on the Continent, his euphemism for consorting with whores. The married, childless Gilbert is devoted to his simple wife Kitty (Lesley Manville), but indifferent to her needs. In two brilliant scenes, their public selves are revealed: the kindly Sullivan tactfully corrects the orchestra after conducting a run-through; the brusque Gilbert undiplomatically distresses the company with his harshly comic comments after a dress rehearsal. At the centre of the movie is the genesis of The Mikado, which comes about as a result of Kitty Gilbert dragging her husband to London's first major exhibition of Japanese arts and crafts. In a magical sequence, the couple watch a Noh Play, take part in a tea ceremony, and gasp as ferocious samurai swordsmen do battle. A germ is planted in the writer's mind that rapidly flowers, and in turn the composer is inspired to produce one of his wittiest scores. But Gilbert's 'Entirely New and Original Japanese Opera' as he called it, represents an anglicisation of the Orient, the imposition of Victorian values on Japan. This aspect of the work is subtly remarked upon when a pair of English singers talk approvingly of the need to mount a punitive expedition against the Mahdi for killing General Gordon at Khartoum, and a Scottish colleague draws their attention to the similar slaughter of islanders on Skye by the English militia. Many members of Topsy-Turvy 's wonderful ensemble cast have worked with Leigh before, Timothy Spall and Alison Steadman among them. And while the performers in the D'Oyly Carte Company didn't create their roles in the way they do in a Leigh play, the rehearsals for The Mikado reflect the spirit of his enterprise. In one particularly exquisite scene, Gilbert brings three Japanese women along to show the singers playing the three little maids from school how to walk and manipulate their fans. As well as looking a rare treat, thanks to Dick Pope's photography, Eve Stewart's production design and Lindy Hemming's costumes, the movie has great music orchestrated by Carl Davis that draws on at least 10 Savoy operas as well as other works by Sullivan. There are marvellous visual jokes, like the primitive telephone by which Gilbert receives coded message about box-office receipts, and the dialogue is consistently elegant and funny. 'This is not grand opera in Milan. It is merely low burlesque in a small theatre on the banks of the River Thames,' the perverse Gilbert tells an actor. The inseparability of Gilbert and Sullivan is underlined when Grossmith, in rehearsal for The Mikado , anticipates a sublime partnership of the next century by accidentally getting wrong Gilbert's line. Instead of 'A nice mess you've got us into', he says 'Another fine mess you've got us into'. Only once does Leigh's text seriously jar, and that is in the otherwise highly amusing moment when Sullivan pompously remarks that a proposed plot 'consists entirely of an artificial and implausible situation'. The exasperated Gilbert replies: 'If you wish to write a grand opera about a prostitute dying of consumption in a garret, I suggest you contact Mr Ibsen in Oslo.' Between 1624 and 1924 Oslo was, in fact, known as Christiania.
2258	2259	Ukip accused of politicising child sex abuse scandal by blaming Labour 	"The UK Independence party is being accused of exploiting the scandal of sexual grooming gangs for political gain after the party's byelection candidate blamed the abuse of white girls mainly by Asian men on Labour's reluctance to upset ""immigrant"" communities. John Bickley, who is standing in the Greater Manchester seat of Heywood and Middleton, has used a campaign leaflet to accuse Ed Miliband's party of betraying working-class girls and highlight Labour's ""love affair with immigration, political correctness and multiculturalism"". His comments have drawn up new, racially charged battle lines in white working-class seats where Ukip hopes to challenge Labour's dominance. A BBC Countryfile presenter who won an ageism claim against the broadcaster, Miriam O'Reilly, will head a list of candidates at a constituency hustings on Monday night. Heywood and Middleton are seen as particularly volatile to issues around race and immigration. Nearby Rochdale became the centre of media attention in 2012 after a sex-trafficking gang of men of mainly Pakistani origin were found to have preyed on at least 47 girls, all of whom white. Many of the victims and their families come from Heywood. Lee Rigby, the fusilier murdered in May 2013 by two Muslim converts near Woolwich barracks in south-east London, came from Middleton, where members of his family still live. The election is due to be held on 9 October and Ukip hopes to overturn the 6,000 majority of the . The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has pledged to fight hard in the seat where the BNP previously won more than 3,000 votes. The Rochdale Labour MP, Simon Danczuk, whose constituency borders Heywood and Middleton, described Bickley's claims as incendiary and incorrect. ""It's now clear that Ukip will try and turn grooming and the death of Lee Rigby into a political football. They're playing politics with horrendous crimes that shocked Heywood and Middleton at a time when the wounds of these events are still healing in our town,"" he said. ""They have got nothing to offer for the victims of abuse, nothing to say about how we face up to years of failure across the country to properly protect children. It's just shameful opportunism and pathetic posturing."" Danczuk, who first named Cyril Smith as a child abuser in the Commons and has campaigned on sexual exploitation gangs, added: ""I'm very clear in that child abuse is not a party-political issue. There have been massive failings everywhere from Oxford to Rochdale and Rotherham to Peterborough. But Ukip want to politicise it."" The leaflet, distributed by the local party in a white working-class area, blames Labour for betraying white victims for fear of upsetting immigrant communities. Bickley is quoted in the leaflet as saying that his father was a Labour trade unionist and worked hard to give his family a good start in life. ""The Labour party of today would be unrecognisable to him,"" Bickley wrote. ""They have betrayed ordinary working people through their love affair with immigration, political correctness and multi-culturalism. ""Labour's betrayal is no more apparent than with the young white working-class girls of Rotherham and Rochdale where rather than upset immigrant communities, years of abuse were ignored and complaints swept under the carpet. ""Meanwhile, the Tories have stood idly by as immigration has driven wages down, created housing shortages and made the life of ordinary people tougher every day."" Warren Mitchell, the chair of Ukip's Rochdale branch, denied the party was trying to exploit racial divisions in the area or the victims of grooming. ""That is not something we would do,"" he said. Ukip is rising in popularity in the runup to the party conference season, according to a poll released on Friday. The party has jumped two percentage points in the past month to stand at 15%, its equal-highest level, while the bigger parties have failed to make significant headway, Ipsos Mori found. Miliband and David Cameron had hoped that the anti-EU party would dwindle in the polls after its victory in the local and European elections in June. Ukip hopes to gain its first parliamentary seat on the day of the Heywood and Middleton election. It is also seeking to win a byelection in Clacton where the sitting Tory MP, Douglas Carswell, resigned after joining Farage's party. There is understood to be unrest among Labour activists at the way local candidates have been overlooked in favour of O'Reilly. Richard Scorer, a solicitor who represents some of the Rochdale abuse victims, has been kept off the final list."
2265	2266	Rochester byelection: local health concerns overshadow Europe 	In a grocery shop near Rochester high street in Kent, Wayne Bywood, 34, is still seething about his experience at Medway Maritime hospital two nights earlier. “I got hit on the face, chest and shoulder by a brick that came through my car window when I was driving,” he says. “I was bleeding, had skin flapping off my face and was semi-conscious. Even though I arrived at 8.20 I didn’t get seen until 11.20 and didn’t get out until 1.20 because I ended up having stitches. “The service was slow and terrible. I didn’t get an x-ray until I moaned that my shoulder was sore and I went from the minor injuries unit to be assessed to the A&E unit for my x-ray and then back again to minor injuries to be stitched.” His mother’s similarly poor experience of the hospital meant that, after going there after the first of her three strokes, she instead went to the Darent Valley hospital in Dartford, 14 miles west, for subsequent treatment. “I would rather spend £10 or £15 on diesel going there or the William Harvey hospital in Ashford [27 miles east] and go to a hospital where staff treat you properly and talk to you nicely,” Bywood says. Stories like his are not hard to find among the 80,886 voters in Rochester and Strood who will choose the Kent seat’s new MP in a byelection on 20 November that is widely seen as one of the most significant for many years, especially for the Conservatives. In La Torretta cafe, next door to the campaign office of Mark Reckless, the Tory MP whose defection to Ukip triggered the poll, one coffee drinker says: “The Medway is infamous. People here say that if you get a diagnosis there, it’s best to get it double-checked.” When shadow chancellor Ed Balls visited recently to support Labour candidate Naushabah Khan, one elderly woman told him she was scared to fall ill in case she ended up in the hospital. The national narrative is that the Rochester byelection will be a verdict on the parties’ stances on immigration and . But voters say the ex-naval hospital is also a major focus. One poll even ranked the state of the health service as their top priority, ahead of “the impact of immigration on your local community”. After a party conference season in which health funding pledges were prominent, and with the set to feature heavily in the runup to the 2015 general election, the byelection is a portent of political battles to come. The Medway has been one of England’s worst-performing hospitals in recent years. Deeply ingrained problems resulted in it being placed into special measures in July last year; its chief executive and chairman were pushed out earlier this year. After a July inspection, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said its A&E unit, surgery department and overall quality of care were inadequate; its medical care, maternity services, end of life care and outpatient clinics required improvement; it relied on constant “firefighting” by staff; its A&E was “in a state of crisis”, with patients being “stacked”, unable to be seen; planned operations were often cancelled; and surgical patients faced delays getting back to their wards. In the window of Reckless’s busy HQ, a former crystal healing shop, a leaflet says he is “backing Medway’s NHS” and features praise from Dr Sanjeev Juneja, a local GP, for Reckless’s “dedication” in helping to save his Marlow Park surgery in Strood from closure. Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst’s six-point plan pledges that if elected, “with our next-door MPs, I’ll bring hospital staff and the national government together to get Medway hospital out of special measures as soon as possible. That hospital saved my life last year and the people there deserve our best efforts.” She was treated for a twisted bowel and recently told the Kent Messenger: “The staff there literally saved my life and without them I wouldn’t be here today.” In her small office near Rochester Castle, the Labour hopeful, Khan, says: “Health is 100% the subject that comes up on the doorsteps. It’s the one issue that people of all ages relate to and have a story to tell about.” When shadow health secretary Andy Burnham visited last week, voters detailed concerns about a range of health issues. “It’s about more than the hospital. People talked about inadequate mental health services, their real frustration at getting to see a GP – sometimes they wait more than a week for an appointment – and the fact that some GPs will only let them talk about one issue at a time, which is madness,” says Khan. She is sceptical about Reckless’s bid to be seen as an NHS supporter, and sees his backing for Labour MP Clive Efford’s private member’s bill to prevent privatisation of health services as close to opportunism. She says: “It’s interesting he’s doing that because when, as an MP, he had the chance to stand up and say NHS privatisation was wrong, he didn’t do so, and now he’s saying he will vote to stop that privatisation. That’s frustrating. And he voted for the Tories’ top-down NHS reorganisation”. Having realised the NHS is such a big issue, the former MP is now “using it as an opportunity to gain leverage”. Khan is running a poor third behind Reckless and Tolhurst, on just 16%. Polls show that 33% of those who voted Labour in 2010 intend to back Ukip. However, Paul Francis, political editor of the Kent Messenger Group, believes that is down to Ukip’s stance on immigration, not the NHS. But given Labour’s plans for the NHS, including a £2.5bn-a-year fund to hire more staff and the fact that health is usually the party’s strongest suit, he is puzzled why it has not made much more of the health service in the campaign. “I’m surprised by that. Ed Miliband’s keynote speech when he came down was about immigration, which he obviously felt Labour needed to clarify its message on,” Francis says. “But, apart from Andy Burnham’s visit, Labour haven’t done much on the NHS. I’m a bit puzzled why they’ve not seen it as a good opportunity to get ahead of the Conservatives and Ukip. They have missed an opportunity here, in my view”.
2274	2275	10 good reasons not to vote for Ukip 	"f the polls are right, and they probably are, legions of ordinary British people, decent in so many respects, will back Ukip in the forthcoming . Some will tick the Farage box because they believe the party to be the future, setting out with clarity our country's political, social and economic future. Others will give their endorsement because they have come to despise the other parties and the establishment. Indeed Farage has been encouraging them to turn away from the political elite and to see Ukip as a new way of doing things. There will be those, genuinely unhappy, who wish for tougher action on migration and a handbrake turn away from Europe. Both are hot-potato issues and Ukip serves up a mash more easily digestible than that available elsewhere. And then there is the contingent that thinks some or none of these things but will vote for the party as a form of interactive entertainment. ""That Farage, he's a good bloke,"" they will say. ""You can have a laugh with him."" Ukip will do well because it can best survive in the polluted atmosphere that engulfs debate about migration and Europe, but also because it's a perfect vehicle for a protest vote. No one takes it very seriously. And that's the sadness. Because Ukip isn't and has never been much of a laughing matter. Here's why … It appears to dislike everything about the European parliament, except, of course, the money EU taxpayers make available to its representatives (of which more later). Anything born of the EU seems bad. Let's consider some of the things that have been bad in the recent past. In the past few months Ukip has voted against updated rules on cab design and safety, which would make it easier for the drivers of lorries to spot pedestrians and cyclists. Also against requirements that MEPs who draft legislation should publish which lobbyists they have met and their influence on the legislation. It opposed greater transparency for clinical trials data and greater protections for holidaymakers buying package holidays. Also legislation to tackle money laundering and calls for greater public access to EU documents. Things are moving in the right direction, perhaps. The , which Farage has called ""drivel"", called for taxi drivers to be required to wear uniforms, dress codes for the theatre and for the Circle line on London's underground to be made a circle again. Farage seems a laugh in that ""hail fellow well met"" way. But you can tell a lot by the friends he keeps. And some of the types he hangs out with in Brussels would be seen as a rough crowd here. There are the figures in the xenophobic and rightwing Italian , the second largest grouping in the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group, which Farage chairs. , its founder, once called for illegal immigrants to be shot. Farage knows they can be a bit unreconstructed. He had to expel one of its MEPs from the group last year after racist comments about Cécile Kyenge, Italy's first black minister. She was, , more suited to being a ""housekeeper"" or a low-level council official than a minister and would impose African ""tribal traditions"" on Italy. The True Finns are firm friends too. One of them collided with a spot of bother for floating to make it easier for police to identify them. The Danish People's party: more ghastlies. In 2002, MEP Morten Messerschmidt was one of a group convicted of racially motivated offences. Frank Vanhecke is there too. He's the former leader of Belgium's Vlaams Blok, the far-right party disbanded after a court said it broke anti-racist laws. He appeared at a student rally with the BNP's Nick Griffin in 2010. None of them are as obviously clubbable as Nige and he may want shot of them after the election. But they have been his Euro-mates for a while. Domestically Ukip talks a good game. We only want respectable types, it says. But , it does seem effortlessly able to attract – among the decent – a proportion of rum characters. When they say racist, Islamophobic or plain offensive things, Farage wields the stick. But even he must wonder why they pitch up on his party's doorstep in the first place. . Having starred in the latest Ukip TV ad, he was outed for dismissing Ed Miliband as ""a Pole"", asserting that Enoch Powell was right, Islam was Satanic and that Africans should be left to ""kill themselves"". He has since been suspended. And then there was , the councillor who attributed the winter floods to gay marriage. popped up this week, calling for Lenny Henry, who seeks equality in the creative arts, to emigrate to ""a black country"". These were outriders, perhaps. But what about fellow MEP , who called for British Muslims to sign a special code of conduct promising not to engage in violent jihad. . But Batten's still there, Ukip MEP for multicultural London. And would any other party have welcomed to a senior post Neil Hamilton, the disgraced poster boy of the cash for questions scandal? , but he's still deputy chair. At the weekend, he was on the BBC wearing his party hat and preaching the Faragian gospel. A strange choice to hoist on to the Ukip soapbox, but not the strangest. Is it worth mentioning that two of Ukip's 2004 intake ended up in jail for EU expenses fraud? The party that isn't like the other parties seems to be like the other parties after all. Recently the party has taken the stick to those who might tarnish its journey into the electoral mainstream. Perhaps that is because with favourable polls comes harsher scrutiny. But hitherto, it seemed to have little problem with those who caused outrage or offence. Poor Godfrey Bloom had to to get himself disciplined, but prior to that, the were viewed benignly. In 2010 we encountered . He was London chairman of Ukip when he thought to website, addressing those whose views were different. ""You leftwing scum are all the same,"" he said. ""Wanting to hand our birthright to Romanian Gypsies who beat their wives and children into begging and stealing money they can gamble with, Muslim nutters who want to kill us and put us all under medieval Sharia law, the same Africans who sold their Afro-Caribbean brothers into a slavery that Britain was the first to abolish (but you still want to apologise for!)."" Like Lampitt, he was suspended. And then he was selected as Ukip's London North East candidate for the London assembly in 2012. He did not win. The Times and Farage have tussled about all the money he claims from the European parliament, in addition to the average £83,000 salary. It is my entitlement, he says. I use EU money to hasten its demise. Much of the focus has been on the monthly fixed-rate allowance of £3,850 and whether it is used to fund his activities as an MEP or party work. But attention has also been paid to the fact that Farage is one of 38 British MEPs in line for a second EU pension, which could reap them £41,000 a year in addition to the basic EU fund. ""It is not a system that I defend but it is the system,"" . His take on the allowances, , is clear and may be instructive. Is this above board, he was asked. ""I think I've kept just the right side of the line, albeit pushing right up to it,"" he replied. Everywhere contradictions. Last week . Having been elected and having pledged to topple the EU from within, one might think the Ukipians would be assiduous attenders, the better to disparage and critique it. Instead, they are . This seems a badge of honour. They get elected to the European parliament, receive a salary and allowances for being members of the European parliament. And then restrict appearances there on the basis that regular attendances would lend the place legitimacy. Ukip's deputy leader, Paul Nuttall, set out the position after his spotty record in the EU parliament was flagged up in the Telegraph. ""I'll hold my hands up,"" he said. ""My attendance record is flaky to say the least. But so what?"" Dispatched to Brussels, his focus is actually his UK fiefdom. ""I treat Brussels with the contempt it deserves."" Much of the criticism of what Farage calls the establishment elite boils down to influence and money. He says that the other parties are in hock to vested interests and that chimes. No one wants to see the political process skewed by interests with fat wallets. So what is one to think of the Ukip poster campaign? The multimillionaire has been generous, as previously he was to the anti-EU Democracy Movement and to the Conservatives before he fell out with them. But the £1.5m publicity campaign – the most visible in the party's history – is as much his as Ukip's. He funded it. Prudent perhaps. One of Britain's richest self-made men, he didn't become rich by wasting his money. But if his input is that important, who calls the shots? Leave aside the now acknowledged mistake of featuring Lampitt in the party political broadcast. And the fact that another person described as an ordinary voter in a manifesto document turned out to be a party employee who works for Farage. And the fact that one man featured in the poster campaign turned out to be a migrant actor from Ireland. And the fact that former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt condemned the image of the British flag on fire. Consider the central implausibility of the central claim: that 26 million of the European unemployed are gunning for jobs in Britain. Two million from the total are British anyway. Consider that if an entity save for a political party enjoying exemption from the advertising code of conduct ran that misleading ad, it would have been forced to withdraw it. Then consider this, from the Sun on 12 April. ""In an article MoT fix axe fears (March 30) we quoted a letter from Ukip containing claims that thousands of MoT test centres could close under EU proposals forcing motorists whose cars fail to go to a different garage for repairs. We have been informed that no such EU proposals exist and are happy to set the record straight."" Has there ever been a major party so dependent on one sellable character? Farage is, without question, the most dominant and effective party leader in national politics. Erase him from the canvas and what is left? EU stayaway Nuttall? ""Liar and a cheat"" Hamilton? The cult of Farage is rivalled only in its potency by the cult of Boris, for like him, Farage is a vivid brand deployed to politics. Both trade illusions. Boris projects slapstick and shambles when all the time beneath is ambitious focus and a keen-eyed grasp of modern politics. Farage is Everyman; all booze and fags and antennae for the cares and fears of ordinary people. This from the son of a stockbroker, with an often-lamented career in the City behind him; children all privately educated; . Quite the biggest achievement of Ukip has been to shape the ground on which we discuss two touchstone issues, Europe and migration. Both are complex. Both bring benefits and present challenges. But Ukip's reductionist approach has made reasoned and nuanced discussion of both virtually impossible. And so, frightened of being eclipsed, and mindful that a simplistic answer will always trump a detailed one in the 24-hour news cycle, politicians in Farage's slipstream distil their own arguments, minimising maturity and sacrificing logic. Those who present a reasoned argument are howled down or judged to have lost the argument. Perhaps the least amusing aspect of Farage is the impact he will have on parties other than his own."
2276	2277	Nigel Farage: Ukip will keep the NHS free at the point of use 	 has said Ukip will keep the NHS free at the point of use after he was caught on camera saying it should move towards an insurance-based system run by private companies. The recording, uncovered by the Guardian, shows Farage saying he thought the marketplace could deliver better value for money when it comes to spending on the . After the Labour leader accused Farage of wanting to privatise the NHS, the Ukip leader challenged him to a one-to-one television debate and hit back in a column for the Independent. He said he was fed up of Miliband’s “mud-slinging” and criticised for thinking it owns the NHS, as well as claiming reports of Ukip’s NHS policy were not accurate. “Because I’ve suggested that government ministers like Jeremy Hunt, Andy Burnham, and Kenneth Clarke aren’t necessarily always the best arbiters of how healthcare is provided, suddenly I’ve been accused of calling for an “American-style” healthcare system. The leftwing press have lapped it all up,” he wrote. “Alas for them and their spin doctors; it’s untrue. I don’t want to hand faceless private-sector companies control of our health service. We’ve now have two successive governments who have done that and it is clear that it doesn’t work.” He did not directly address the video, made in September 2012 on his Common Sense tour of the UK, which contrasts with Ukip’s new claims that it is opposed to privatisation of the NHS. Speaking to a meeting in Sussex, Farage said: “I think we’re going to have to think about healthcare very, very differently. I think we are going to have to move to an insurance-based system of healthcare. Frankly, I would feel more comfortable that my money would return value if I was able to do that through the market place of an insurance company than just us trustingly giving £100bn a year to central government and expecting them to organise the healthcare service from cradle to grave for us. “I just feel with the whole healthcare service, one promise Blair did keep is that he would increase expenditure. We’ve doubled expenditure on the NHS in 15 years and we haven’t got frankly double the return. “If I had a magic answer, I could glibly say, don’t give the EU £50m quid a day and spend it on British pensioners. That would get a clap round the audience but actually even that would not be sufficient to deal with the scale of this problem. That is me being completely honest with you.” Asked about the video, a Ukip spokesman said the NHS was an area where the party’s policy has developed the most over the last few years and Farage’s comments in Sussex no longer represented his views. “Obviously things have moved on significantly since then. That was then and this is now. It doesn’t stand up to say that’s still his view.” The Ukip spokesman said there was some truth in the idea that something has got to give in the NHS but it would be reckless and impractical to go that way in the foreseeable future. He also pointed out Ukip has taken the radical step of aligning with the trade unions to oppose TTIP – a US-EU trade deal that its opponents say could allow American private health firms into the NHS. “We have people in the party who know significantly more about the NHS than we did at that time,” the spokesman said. The NHS has become a huge battleground in byelections between Labour and Ukip, which is trying to appeal to the disillusioned left. Farage’s party fought the Heywood & Middleton byelection and is battling to win Rochester & Strood next week on a platform of protecting the NHS. However, Labour has pointed out on its leaflets that Ukip MEP Paul Nuttall, posted a letter on his website a few years ago praising the coalition for bringing a “whiff of privatisation to the NHS”. Farage has also got into hot water previously for telling the Telegraph that he thought a big businessman could be better at running the NHS than its current officials.
2277	2278	Nigel Farage selected by Ukip to fight South Thanet constituency in 2015 	"The east Kent constituency of South Thanet has been catapulted to the forefront of British politics after local Ukip members selected the party leader, , to be their general election candidate, setting up an intriguing battle with a Tory candidate who once headed Ukip himself. In many ways ideal Ukip territory, the Conservative-held constituency – described by one expert as ""an economically stagnant coastal seat, where there are lots of older, white and angry voters"" – has long been regarded as Ukip's best chance of getting an MP. While Farage had insisted he was ""no shoo-in"" before Tuesday night's selection vote in central Ramsgate, he was the only one of the four nominees to have been tailed around the town's historic seafront by a BBC camera crew; even in the driving rain, voter recognition was strong. ""I hope you'll be representing us Nigel,"" RAF veteran Paul Stoner shouted across a street as the Ukip leader walked by, cigarette in mouth. For Stoner, Farage would be an ideal MP due to ""talking common sense"". Echoing a sentiment among others who encountered Farage on his walkabout, the pensioner added: ""I am not a prejudiced man but I think we are overpopulated and have too many immigrants here, and that includes Ramsgate."" Further along the promenade, Farage and his small entourage stopped in Corby's Tea Rooms, where he was given a warm reception by owners Len and Pat, who cited local concerns about overcrowded schools and NHS. ""There are a lot of people, and not just here, who see their country going to pot and they feel that he can do something about it,"" added Pat, formerly of Bermondsey, south London. Pat said she no longer felt the district was ""my town"" when she returned. ""A lot of people do agree with him and a lot of people are offended by him but I think it's horses for courses, isn't it?"" To Farage, the constituency is familiar territory; he contested it in 2005, though won just 5% of the vote. As he strode the harbour front on Tuesday however, he was confident that the wind was in his sails, pointing to factors in his favour ranging from Ukip's recently elected crop of local councillors to the impact on the area of decisions made elsewhere. ""You see a place with an amazing heritage in history, and people are rightly proud of where it is and what it is,"" said Farage. ""And yet it feels like the end of the line, that something has gone wrong. The mining has gone and manufacturing, Pfizer, has gone. ""Support for us on Europe is 100% here,"" he said, gesturing to the harbour. ""Yes there are some pretty nice boats owned by rich people but you have a fishing industry that has been wiped out by European policy."" Admitting that voters in the past had not seen Ukip as a credible alternative, he added: ""Messages have their time and you can be too early with them. But the other factor is that it's not just about the policy. It's about having a credible organisation in place."" A poll conducted in July by the Conservative Lord Ashcroft showed that Ukip was currently ahead in the constituency, with 32% against 30% for the , who will be represented by Craig Mackinlay, who led Ukip in the late 1990s but defected in 2005. Labour, on 27%, are also likely to fancy their chances of gaining from a split rightwing vote. At the last election Laura Sandys won the seat for the Tories with a majority of 7,617. But she has decided to stand down, citing family demands. The constituency is in many ways ""classic Ukip territory"", according to Matthew Goodwin, an expert on Ukip and co-author of Revolt on the Right: Explaining Support for the Radical Right in Britain. Citing the area's economic difficulties and Ukip-friendly voter demographic, he said: ""The local political factors play to Farage as well; the local Conservative MP is standing down, removing any incumbency factor, while the Tories have decided to stand an old Ukip activist as their candidate, which risks alienating anti-Ukip tactical voters who might otherwise have flocked behind a more centrist candidate. ""Add to that the fact that Ukip have been fighting the seat since 2001, that Farage knows the seat like the back of his hand and has lots of activists in the Kent area who can be pulled in to support his campaign, and you begin to see why the seat offers something of a perfect storm to Ukip's increasingly confident leader."""
2278	2279	Tory MP Douglas Carswell defects to Ukip and forces byelection 	"A hand grenade has been thrown into David Cameron's general election campaign after the Eurosceptic Tory MP defected to Ukip, triggering an early byelection. A leading member of the new generation of Tory Eurosceptics who has campaigned openly for a British exit from the EU, Carswell said he had endured sleepless nights in the runup to his decision, which was prompted by the prime minister's failure to deliver change in the EU. Carswell indicated he would shortly resign as MP for Clacton, Essex, guaranteeing a difficult byelection for the Tories. As the sitting MP, Carswell will have an immediate advantage in a seat described by the academic Matthew Goodwin as the most Ukip-friendly area in the country. It is the first time since 1982 that an MP has resigned their seat to fight a byelection on behalf of another party. Criticising the Tories for failing to deliver change, Carswell said: ""They are not serious about real change. It's above all the failure to deliver on the promise of political reform that has driven me to be here today. ""Europe's the one continent on the globe that is not growing … yet who in Westminster, who among our so-called leaders, is prepared to envisage real change?"" . will now be heading to Clacton to call a by election William Hague, the leader of the Commons, led an immediate Tory fightback against Carswell as he declared that his former colleague's defection would make an EU membership referendum less likely by increasing the chances of an Ed Miliband victory. Hague told The World at One on BBC Radio 4: ""It is a regrettable thing and it is a totally counterproductive thing to do because the only chance of real change in Europe, the only chance of having a referendum where people can decide to stay in the EU or leave the EU is having a majority Conservative government at the election next year. Anything that makes that more difficult damages the chances of change in Europe or the people in this country having their say."" But Nigel Farage, who unveiled his new party member at a Westminster press conference after secretive negotiations, said he expected further defections. Farage told The World at One: ""We have talked to Tory and Labour MPs over the course of the last six months who very very strongly support everything Ukip is trying to do. The real answer to [the] question – how many others – will all depend on this byelection. This byelection is going to be a High Noon moment."" Carswell's announcement hands the prime minister a major pre-election headache on the eve of the return of parliament from its summer recess. Ukip will receive wall-to-wall coverage in the runup to the byelection, where it will start as the favourite in a seat where Carswell had a majority of 12,068 at the last general election. Carswell's move may also encourage other Tories to jump ship. Eurosceptic Tories who remain in the party may feel emboldened to challenge the PM, possibly by declaring in their general election addresses that they would campaign to leave the EU in the referendum planned by Cameron in 2017. Carswell said he had welcomed the prime minister's EU speech in January last year, in which Cameron pledged to hold an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership by 2017. He said: ""No one cheered DC's Bloomberg speech more loudly than me … but there's been nothing since. They haven't thought it through. There is a world of change and opportunity out there. Ministers are simply not up to giving us the kind of realignment we need. . : with the news on , ""David Cameron might come back from holiday again."" ""I've had more sleepless nights than you can possibly imagine. I am standing here precisely because I know that neither side wants real change [on the EU]. Ed Miliband has been honest enough to say he doesn't want real change. The Conservative leadership is not serious about change … David Cameron has made up his mind that he wants to stay in."" Carswell, who voted for Cameron in the 2005 leadership contest, said he had no personal difficulties with the PM. ""I happen to like David Cameron – I am not expecting him to now reciprocate my feelings. He is fun, he is a likeable person. He is a nice, decent person. He is just not serious about the change we need."" Sitting alongside Farage, Carswell joked about his record as a rebellious Tory MP. ""It's nice to have a leader with whom I agree."" Farage joked: ""It is early days though."" The Ukip leader praised Carswell for his bravery as he became the first MP since the late Bruce Douglas-Mann in 1982 to resign a parliamentary seat in order to trigger a byelection where he will stand for another party. Farage said Carswell had made the ""bravest and most honourable"" decision he had seen in British politics. It is unclear when the byelection will be held. Carswell did not say when he would be resigning his seat. The writ for any byelection would be moved by the Tories. The defection of Carswell will not cause great surprise in Tory circles, but his decision will fuel fears that the party may be heading for an historic split on Europe. Some senior Eurosceptics have said the party will undergo its most damaging split since the Corn Laws of the mid-19th century if the prime minster holds his in/out EU membership referendum. Miliband tweeted: ""Douglas Carswell's defection is not just a blow to David Cameron. It shows the Tory Party too divided to stand up for hard-working families."" Carswell is respected across the board at Westminster for the clarity of his thinking. He is a strong supporter of greater transparency in politics and has campaigned for parliamentary candidates to be selected in open primaries and for a power of recall of MPs to be introduced. He says his stance on EU withdrawal developed out of a belief the organisation is run by unaccountable and undemocratic institutions. On Tuesday, Farage in Kent at next May's general election. Douglas Carswell MP Photograph: Paul Grover/Rex Features A frequent Tory rebel on Europe, Douglas Carswell first stood for parliament in 2001 against Tony Blair, as the Conservative candidate for Sedgefield. He apologised for coming second, but managed to cut Blair's majority by over 7,500 votes. The Clacton MP entered parliament in 2005 and helped write a publication, Direct Democracy: an Agenda for a New Model Party. The publication was described by the Spectator as being ""one of the founding texts of the new, revitalised Toryism"", which had ""argued compellingly that the party should embrace radical localism"". A number of ideas outlined in it have since become mainstream Conservative thinking; the call for directly elected police chiefs is now party policy and the use of open primaries to select party candidates. Carswell, often described as a libertarian, gained notoriety at Westminster when he led a campaign to remove Michael Martin, then the Speaker of the House, for a failure to ensure greater transparency on how the Commons is run. In December 2009, Carswell introduced a bill requesting a public referendum on British EU membership. During the 2009 expenses scandal, the Daily Telegraph revealed he had claimed among other things a £655 ""love seat"" and had flipped his second home. He lived up to his law and order credentials by turning crimefighter in his own constituency in January, breaking the news on Twitter. ""Just chased and caught a shoplifter in Clacton … waiting for police."" Seven minutes later, he tweeted again: ""Police response time pretty effective. Arrested. Now off to my advice surgery."" Carswell later explained: ""I was in the centre of Clacton going from one constituency appointment to the next as MPs do on a Friday. I heard someone shout and saw someone trying to run away. There was a store detective shouting at them."" Born in 1971, Carswell grew up in Africa where his parents worked as doctors among some of the world's poorest people. His father, Wilson Carswell, a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, diagnosed the first cases of HIV/Aids in Uganda in the early 1980s. Carswell went to St Andrew's School, Turi, in Kenya and then Charterhouse in the UK. He read history at the University of East Anglia and at King's College, London. Before politics, Carwell worked in television and then investment management. He also worked in the Conservative party's policy unit, run by David Cameron."
2287	2288	Ukip MEP apologises for apparently calling charity boss a paedophile 	A Ukip MEP has been forced to apologise for apparently calling the head of a Christian charity a paedophile on Twitter. Jane Collins, one of Ukip’s leading politicians, agreed to make a donation to the charity after she implied that Mark Russell was a criminal on the social networking site on Thursday. Russell, who is a Labour party member and head of the Church Army charity, had posted support for his party’s candidate in the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner byelection. But Collins replied, telling Russell: “Yes because we’d soon stop your criminal activity. Paedos leave our kids alone. #Ukip.” The byelection was prompted by the resignation of the Labour police commissioner Shaun Wright in the wake of the Rotherham child exploitation scandal. Collins initially refused to apologise for her paedophile implication, saying: “It was aimed at the paedophiles not you.” But she agreed to delete the tweet because it “read wrong”, explaining: “I’m a bit hot headed sometimes.” She later added: “I apologise for associating you with paedophiles but you’re still supporting a party that has failed our children badly.” However, Russell said the Ukip MEP was turning her mistake into party politics and threatened her with legal action. Eventually she conceded: “I am in the wrong … I unreservedly apologise for implication.” Russell told the Guardian the tweet was highly damaging to his work, which includes supporting vulnerable people. It was made worse because Collins’s accusation was retweeted many times by Ukip supporters, he said. He told Collins: “I’ve dedicated my life to helping kids and your tweet was as hurtful as offensive … this is my reputation. “I merely encouraged my fellow South Yorks residents to vote for Alan Billings, the Labour candidate.” Russell is the head of Church Army, an evangelist charity linked to the Church of England that has the Queen as its patron. He said the MEP had offered to make a donation to the group after he threatened to sue her. Collins’s tweet follows accusations that Ukip exploited the suffering of Rotherham sex abuse victims for political gain in the police and crime commissioner byelection. One victim denounced the party’s tactics as “disrespectful” after it launched a “1,400 reasons to vote” campaign, in reference to the estimated number of victims in the city between 1997 and 2013. Collins did not respond to emails from the Guardian.
2299	2300	Ukip councillor: immigration ‘overload’ has made UK racist 	The Ukip leadership has moved to distance the party from remarks by one of its councillors claiming an “overload” of immigrants had turned Britain into a racist country. Trevor Shonk, who represents Ukip on Kent county council and Ramsgate town council, blamed Labour and the Conservatives for allowing in more immigrants than the country could cope with. “The two main parties that have been running this country have made the country racist because of the influx that we have had,” he told BBC Radio 4’s The World at One. “When I’ve done leaflets every shopkeeper, whether they are Asian or English-born, they’re concerned about the influx. “It hasn’t been staggered; it’s just overload. We haven’t got the care homes, we haven’t got the houses for our own.” However, the Ukip deputy chairman, Suzanne Evans, rejected the suggestion that Britain was racist and said that Shonk “didn’t express it as well as he could”. “I think Britain is actually a very accommodating country and I don’t think by any stretch of the imagination can be termed racist,” she told The World at One. “I know what councillor Shonk meant. Perhaps he didn’t express it as well as he could. There has of course been a massive increase in immigration, which people find incredibly difficult to deal with.” The latest comments come after Ukip parliamentary candidate Kerry Smith was forced to stand down over racist and homophobic comments he made. Meanwhile, another Ukip councillor in Kent, Martyn Heale, was reported to have spoken of his regret at having been a member of the far right National Front in the 1970s. Heale, who was a Conservative activist for 20 years before joining Ukip a decade ago, would not be interviewed for broadcast, but told the BBC that it was really depressing to be reminded of his past. “I obviously regret what I did,” he told the BBC. Evans complained that media reporting of Ukip was unfair, pointing out that Labour had councillors who had previously been in the National Front or the BNP while crimes involving councillors from other parties often went unreported in the national media. “The media reporting of Ukip is not fair,” she said. “I think the establishment is very upset with Ukip and the fact that it is shaking the cosy status quo, the stitch-up the three old parties have had between them. “Ukip is standing up for things that good, honest, decent people care about.”
2300	2301	Nigel Farage claims in video MEPs can earn like a Goldman Sachs banker 	"A video of shows him saying that as an MEP he could earn as much as a Goldman Sachs banker through claiming expenses and employing his wife. The clip, thought to have been filmed in 1999 or 2000, shows him holding a wodge of cash as he speaks about being able to claim more than £250,000 a year. While criticising the MEP expense system as ""wrong"" and ""monstrous"", particularly the generous travel allowance, he goes on to say: ""It's a good job, this. I reckon, I worked it out that because so much of what you get is after tax that if you used the secretarial allowances to pay your wife on top of all the other games you could play, I reckon this job in sterling terms is worth over a quarter of a million pounds a year to you - that is what you would need to earn working for Goldman Sachs or someone like that."" Ukip has repeatedly accused the Conservatives of being part of a campaign to smear its politicians. A Ukip spokesman said: ""Ukip membership has just hit an all-time high of 34,320 and our poll ratings are bouyant. The political establishment clearly doesn't like it."" Farage's wife, Kirsten, is employed by Farage as a ""local assistant"" using EU allowances. MEPs have not been allowed to employ their husbands or wives since 2004 but those already in employment were allowed to remain on the payroll."
2306	2307	Ukip to give priority to council house applicants with parents born locally 	"Council house applicants whose parents or grandparents were born locally should be given priority on waiting lists, according to a new policy from the UK Independence Party. The proposal, to be launched at the party's annual conference which begins on Friday, will be seen as a direct appeal to voters concerned by much-reported claims that immigrants are able to move to the top of housing priority lists. But it will also draw criticism that Nigel Farage's party is appealing to beliefs which are allegedly based on scant evidence. Andrew Charalambous, Ukip's housing spokesman, said the proposal would strengthen local communities, particularly in , because many people are being encouraged to move out to obtain cheaper housing. This problem, he claimed, has been exacerbated by influxes of immigrants, some of whom apply for social housing. ""With the 2011 census showing almost three million people or 36.7% of London's population are foreign-born, making London the city with the second largest immigrant population after New York City, it is likely that the inflow of migrants has been a massive factor in the overcrowding of the city's social housing. ""It is imperative that the issue is tackled. We need to see more social housing made available and priority given to British families and those who have contributed to the system over a number of years."" In March, David Cameron made a similar pledge. He said ministers, through new statutory guidance, would ensure that people lived in the same area for between two and five years before they would be allowed on to a waiting list for social housing. Ukip's new policy, party insiders say, takes that one step further. It proposes that an applicant be given priority if their parents can be shown to have been born in the borough. This would be expanded to grandparents on a sliding scale if there are a number of similar applicants. A party source denied the policy appeals to racist sentiments. ""Many black and minority ethnic people in Britain are second and third-generation city dwellers. We are appealing to them as well as others,"" he said. The party has thrived not only because of its Eurosceptic stance but also because of its hard line on immigration, particularly on people from countries which have recently gained access to the EU. At the conference, Ukip will also publish a number of freedom of information requests to London boroughs to bolster claims that many people who are not British successfully apply for social housing. Ukip said Camden council figures show that of the borough's 22,817 tenants, about 8,000 describe themselves as British while some 6,000 say they are foreign nationals. The remainder declined to define themselves. A council insider said Ukip may be seizing upon incomplete data to make a simplistic political point. ""A vast majority of people who live in our accommodation have been there for a long time and have grown up there and stayed there. If they are not British nationals, they may well be British residents and this is not reflected in the data,"" the official said. Farage will use the conference, on the party's 20th anniversary, to solidify his surge in support over the last nine months to become the country's third most popular party in the polls. Some senior members hope Farage will try to instil some party discipline and draw up some new policies as they come under greater scrutiny. Recent gaffes have included footage – which was discovered by the Guardian – of the MEP Godfrey Bloom alleging that UK aid goes to ""bongo bongo land"". Some council candidates have written offensive comments while using social media. These embarrassments have done little to dent Ukip's popularity. The surge has taken on greater significance after polling from Lord Ashcroft this month found that the party has helped to squeeze the Tory vote in many key marginals, providing Labour with an 8.5% swing since the 2010 general election. The results fuelled demands by some Tory MPs for the party to strike a general election pact with Ukip before the polls in 2015."
2314	2315	Farage under attack over calls to scrap anti-discrimination laws 	The leaders of Britain’s three main political parties have closed ranks to condemn after the Ukip leader called for the scrapping of the bulk of the country’s anti-discrimination laws. David Cameron said Farage was guilty of attention seeking while Ed Miliband branded the remarks by the Ukip leader as “wrong, divisive and dangerous”. said Farage was guilty of instilling fear in people by conflating various sensitive issues, including warning that some Muslims want to form a ”fifth column” and calling for the scrapping of most of Britain’s anti-discrimination laws. The deputy prime minister accused Farage of acting in an irresponsible way by mixing fears about violent Islamist extremism with concerns about immigration from eastern Europe. “He instils fear by confusing a lot of these things,” Clegg said on his weekly radio phone-in programme on LBC. Farage replied to the criticisms by tweeting the prime minister and the Labour leader in defence of his remarks that were made in a Channel 4 interview with Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the equality and human rights commission. In his tweet to Cameron, Farage said: In his tweet to Miliband, the Ukip leader said: The row erupted after Farage told Phillips that who did not want to integrate. “People do see a fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us,” he said. Farage also said race and other anti-discrimination legislation should be abolished on the grounds that people were “colour blind”. He said employers should be entitled to discriminate in favour of a British, rather than a Polish, worker. Pressed on which discrimination laws he would get rid of, the Ukip leader said: “Much of it. I think the employer should be much freer to make decisions on who he or she employs.” Asked whether there would be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour under Ukip, Farage added: “No … because we take the view, we are colour blind. We as a party are colour blind.” The Ukip leader hit back at his critics and said he had not been talking about race. He insisted that he had simply raised concerns about two matters: extremists and the way in which EU laws meant that a Polish worker had the same employment rights in the UK as a British worker. Farage told LBC before the Clegg phone-in: “The first thing I said was that we’ve never before had a migrant group come to Britain who have tried to change our culture. And unfortunately there are a small number in the Muslim community who genuinely want to introduce sharia law to Britain, etc. That is a wholly uncontroversial comment. “The second thing I was saying was this: small businesses … feel very, very pressured by continued legislation and in many cases fearful of taking on staff. What I said is if a British employer, a small business, wants to be employ a British person over somebody from Poland, they should be able to do that without fear that they have contravened discrimination laws. That is all I have said.” Clegg responded to Farage by telling LBC that the Ukip leader was instilling fear in people by conflating various sensitive issues on immigration and extremism. The deputy prime minister said: “He is mixing sharia law, violent extremist, red tape, how small businesses run their businesses, into one great – he is skilled at this – mix. “It is a fact to say there is a very, very worrying phenomenon of extremism, and in some cases violent extremism, within parts of our Muslim communities. That is quite different to saying you scrap all [anti-discrimination laws]. It is very, very unhelpful to conflate the decision a baker in Orpington can make about a Polish or a British worker with violent extremism that you see in Iraq and Syria. That is what is so irresponsible about the way in which Nigel Farage handles these issues. He instils fear by confusing a lot of these things.” Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, said: “This is one of the most shocking things I have ever heard from a mainstream politician and demonstrates breath-taking ignorance. “We have made huge progress on tackling racial inequality and discrimination in this country, partly because of Labour’s strong anti-discrimination laws, but things are still far from perfect. When my parents moved to London they frequently saw signs saying ‘no blacks, no dogs, no Irish’; what Ukip is suggesting would take us back to those days.” Ukip took a bullish approach to the criticisms. In addition to Farage’s tweets the party highlighted a Facebook advertisement for a job by the Dutch offshore energy company advertising for riggers and forklift from the Baltic States to work on a project in the UK. “Baltic nationality is required,” the advert by Oceanwide Vlissingen says. This would be illegal under the EU laws Farage is complaining about which say that all EU citizens have to be treated equally. The Ukip leader said: “It is this sort of anti-British worker discrimination that shows the disadvantage that British workers are facing in the jobs market.”
2317	2318	Greens ahead of Liberal Democrats in YouGov poll 	The Green party is ahead of the in a national opinion poll – a finding that intensified pressure for the Greens to be represented in a general election TV debates between party leaders. YouGov research for the Sun has Labour on 34%, three points ahead of the Conservatives, Ukip on 17%, the Greens on 7% and the Lib Dems on 6%. The poll findings maintain Ukip’s surge in popularity, which saw the Eurosceptic party come top in May’s European elections and leave it on course to take a second Commons seat from the Tories at the Rochester and Strood byelection next month. The Greens have been ahead of the Lib Dems in polls before, but never with YouGov. The BBC has cited such a “ ” in Ukip as justification for including its leader, Nigel Farage, in one of the live debates proposed by broadcasters. Farage is slated to appear alongside David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband in a four-way confrontation – with the three established Westminster party leaders in another and just the prime minister and opposition leader in a third. – after the party received significant support online for its demand to be part of the lineup – the BBC said they had “not demonstrated any comparable increase in support in either elections or opinion polls”. Even if the party were to outpoll the Lib Dems, the starting point would be the junior coalition party’s performance at the 2010 general election, which was “substantially ahead of the Green party”, it suggested. The BBC “will continue to keep any new evidence of increased support for the under close review”, the broadcaster said. The party’s leader, Natalie Bennett, said the “would seem to be concentrating too much on past performance rather than looking at current interest in the Greens”.
2319	2320	How Tony Blair's team fought and failed to see-off Gordon Brown's coup 	"It is an account, relying on contemporary vivid emails, of the minute-by-minute battle inside Downing Street in the first week of September 2006 to stop supporters of the chancellor, , forcing Tony Blair to quit after nine years as prime minister and three election victories. It is an episode that in the end humiliated Blair, revealing his political weakness, and has come to shape many voters' views of Brown himself. The contemporary party still bears the scars of that week. Blair had been elected to a historic third term only 15 months before, but within months of the re-election Brown and his allies were mounting a highly organised backstage campaign to extract a specific public date for Blair's departure – an orderly and stable transition. Brown, long scarred by his rival's success, was certain that after the Iraq war Blair had lost the voters trust irrecoverably, and he wanted copper-bottomed public guarantees that Blair would stand down by a specific date in the third term. He felt he had been misled by too many evasive promises in the past, and also feared that Blair was secretly manoeuvring to betray him by supporting a successor other than Brown, probably David Miliband, then the environment secretary, or John Reid, then home secretary. The spark that led to the rebellion was an interview in the Times in which Blair tried carefully to balance his determination to continue without a fixed departure date with his willingness to make good his promise to go in ""ample time"" for his successor. Through the first week of September, after returning from holiday, Brown's allies demanded not only a date for Blair's departure, but also Blair's endorsement of Brown as his anointed successor. The emails show the doubts in the Blair camp over how to fend off the demands for a resignation, as well as their anger at what they saw as a coup. They were thunderstruck at the leak of internal No 10 emails suggesting Blair might go out with ""the crowds demanding more"". They also revealed the extent to which No 10 was caught largely unawares at the scale of the organised rebellion mounted by Brownite MPs. In the midst of the crisis 17 MPs called for his resignation, including four parliamentary secretaries. Downing Street then belatedly, desperately, fought back, trying to rally loyalist opinion inside the parliamentary party and in the media. Blair's own anger at what he described as the ""machinations"" are revealed, as well as his frustration that Brown would not agree to a joint policy programme. At times the aides became so infuriated they proposed to end all co-operation with Brown, and promised to fight to the end. On the Thursday of the dramatic week, Blair capitulated. On a pre-arranged visit to a school in London, the prime minister, using words drafted by shattered aides only hours before, apologised to the country for his party's behaviour and confirmed promises made by Miliband earlier in the week that he would quit within a year. With no questions permitted he issued a short statement: ""I am happy to confirm in public what I have already told senior colleagues in private: that Manchester will be my last conference as party leader."" His dignity was only half intact: he had rebuffed calls for a specific timetable, but been forced to specify an end point. Still seeking some running room, he said: ""I will do that at a future date; and I'll do it in the interests of the country and in the circumstances of the time."" In the words of , Blair's chief of staff, they had kept the ship afloat, but only just. Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, who was the Downing Street director of No 10's strategic communications unit (SCU), was very much in the thick of it. Reflecting on those days, he says that the response from Team Blair to the Brownite letter writing campaign ""was remarkably naive; co-ordinated through random email chains, conference calls and impromptu meetings"" while Team Brown were running a ""more disciplined war room"". from to (BBC political editor): I'm back and on the case. Just had 4 weeks off. Should we have a chat on the phone on Tuesday? from 4 weeks. What a delight. I'll call. . from (deputy chief of staff in No 10) to : Did you spk to him? He is mulling a tougher line than this. from to : I did. I know he wants to go much further. ""This is the debate. These are the choices. We need to get on with this. I have given more clarity on timing than my predecessors. If this nonsense does not come to an end all bets are off."" While this is all fine the danger is that he seems a) wildly out of touch b) it precipitates a more formal challenge. I think also internally we need a line and need to discuss further, without him, to clarify what we think. from to others in Blair's office: I have had another idea. A potential concession which strengthens. from : Phase 1 Times interview. Make argument that by giving a date undermines position of PM. ""If I thought that speculation would come to an end if I name a date, then I would consider that. I will be taking soundings and listening to the people in the run up to conference."" Phase 2 Letter from cross section of MPs saying PM has made clear to be happy to indicate when he intends to leave office if the speculation came to a end. Phase 3 At conference or maybe before (but conference better because it keeps GB guessing). ""People have made clear that the instability will come to an end if I gave an indication of when the next leadership elections will take place. In politics you can never be certain of anything, but i have informed the national executive that they should be making plans to hold an election early next autumn."" If this was seen as to be reasonable and sensible there is a chance that things might die down. from : I thought of a different formulation. ""GB knows perfectly well when I am stepping down as I have discussed it with him."" I don't really like your formulation because it does not look as if he is in control of his destiny – but maybe this is a small price to pay for peace and another 9 months. from : I know but if things don't take a turn for the better by mid-September then it might not be a bad option. from : I am now the benefactor of hourly phone calls from [ ] Milburn and [ ] Byers. They have been in touch with the ex-ministers group and they have suggested a letter to the Guardian. The obvious danger is that we get into willy waving with the other MPs saying TB should go. from : ""The PM has made clear he will not be setting out a timetable for when he leaves office. He has given more clarity on the issue than any other previous prime minister in office he will not be going on and on like Mrs Thatcher. ""He will not be serving a full third term. He will be giving his successor ample time. ""There are three groups of people who are demanding the PM goes further than this. Those who are concerned by the polls ... Those who are concerned he will be going on and on – he has dealt with those in his interview. ""The biggest concern is amongst those wanting him to leave is that they want a change of direction and that is why we need a genuine debate about the future direction of the party – there are big issues which the party needs to face up to anything from immigration security and the future of our pubic services. These are the issues that the PM intends to address in the coming period."" from : Reflecting some discussions with middle ground MPs, there are some things that it would make it easier to hold where we are. An explanation for why TB does not want a timetable but at the same time seems to be pointing to one next year. The most potent arguments are 1 For TB to be seen to be forced into a timetable would lead to paralysis and be counter-productive both for party and government, and it would not anyway satisfy the Compass group tendency . 2 To give the opposition advance knowledge of when our leadership contest will be would be inept.. ... We need a progressive and friendly account of why TB wants to steer through policy reforms [about academies and the NHS] …It is vital that by the time of conference we have a substantive and strong account of what TB wants to do in the autumn and new year. from to : Yes it would be good to have Ruth [Kelly] out there saying TB's position totally reasonable, made clear not going on and on, ample time offered, big important debate to be had about the future of the government, and that is the one RK is engaged with. from : Spoken to Alan Johnson read the Times and thinks he is being eminently reasonable and acting in the interests of the party. Thinks it is obvious that TB is talking about sometime in 2007, but the moment of choosing should be his, it is not in GB's interests that TB is pushed, or that he goes before the Welsh or Scottish elections. AJ is talking to Nick Robinson off the record and is talking to David Hill about doing interviews/clips. from : Is it not worth getting some people like Buck etc to write letters to their CLP chairs which they can then put up on their websites and release to the media? from to : Julie has called to say Ruth is willing to do whatever is needed. I have said we should try and get her on some shows. from : The Downing Street team are discussing conference slogans. Peter Hyman (Blair speechwriter) suggests something along the lines of ""Building for the future to reclaim future."" from : GB will not have the word ""future"" in the line at the moment. from : So BBC chose Sarah McCarthy-Fry, Julie Morgan and George Mudie who are hostile rather than Mike Gapes, Ann Clwyd and Karen Buck [who] are reasonable and supportive. This is a campaign organisation and not a news outlet! from Did we publish his three foreign policy speeches as a pamphlet? TB wants to send to Murdoch. from : I AM GOING MAD I HAVE HAD TOO SPEAK TO THE PRESS FOR THE PAST 3 HOURS. from : Is Guardian true re Chris [Bryant] and Sion [Simon]. Am happy to do any TB boosting if you need anyone? from : I drafted this internally and sent it to a handful of people. It is strange that the Mirror did not know who wrote this, which suggests they had a paper copy, without the email. from : TB wants to be very hard on the memo. TB never saw the memo nor did senior staff ... Off the record he wants to brief that he has told his staff there is no point trying to restore this aspect or that of his image. He wants to concentrate in the final period of embedding the public-service reforms. from : Attached is the statement [the counter letter]. Aiming for 30 plus names by lunchtime trying to get MPs to ring other MPs so it does not look like all from here. Can we all send names to Razi , and Razi can you update every 30 mins on the names we have, plus any people that have refused? from : Can we continue to try to get MPs to ring each other? We won't be able to pretend this is spontaneous but we want it to be seen we are co-ordinating an MPs effort rather than driving it from here. from : At 11.30am we have 17 names. from Wegg-Prosser [Karen] Buck is next port of call we need her up and about very quickly. Her phone [is] switched off and we are chasing her. If Buck does not come through in an hour we will need to identify another candidate to lead on this. Lunchtime news confused, but tone not good. from : Treachery. Sion has signed the letter. from : Currently we have 34 names doc attacked from : I am working hard behind the scenes to keep the unions out of all this turmoil and want no pretext for them saying we are fingering them. from : Can we aim to have a definitive list of MPs by 5.30?

List attached. from : add Mary Creagh and Jim Sheridan. from : Sheridan IS ON THEIR LETTER from : I know a real unravelling, Anne Moffat in Scotland persuaded Jim. from : now 57 MPs from : What about getting some of the old timers - Kauffman Barron, Blunks including peers - to organise a letter to the Times saying we been here before with Labour tearing itself apart 18 Tory years, getting rid of leader meant tory civil war, have we not learnt anything? from : I just spoke to Karen [Buck] who made the following points. nervous about being a Number 10 operation and is concerned names all cronies. I said we are relaxed re No 10 and pointing out that she had resigned a few months ago.

2322	2323	Green party membership doubles to 27,600 as Ukip’s reaches 40,000 	Membership of the of England and Wales has doubled since January this year to reach 27,618. Ukip has seen its membership rise to 40,000 in October; close to that of the , suggesting a trend away from mainstream Westminster parties to smaller parties. Both Ukip and to a lesser extent the Greens have been given a fillip by increasing publicity, including over . The Greens said they had recruited an extra 500 members – powered partly by , leader of the Green party of England and Wales, putting on a strong performance on BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions. The party is polling about 6 to 7% in latest polls, just behind the Liberal Democrats. A Green party spokesman said the party was committed to standing in at least 75% of constituencies in the 2015 general election – meaning 50% more people will have the opportunity to vote Green in 2015 than did in 2010. Nearly half of the Green party membership is aged under 40 and more than 50% of the growth in membership this year took place in October and November, possibly a spillover from the Scottish referendum or a response to the publicity the party has received as a result of being excluded by broadcasters from the TV leaders’ debates. Although its largest membership areas are in the south and south-west, the party’s largest percentage rise this year has occurred in the north-west, Yorkshire and Wales, suggesting it is putting down stronger regional roots. The Scottish Greens also increased its membership to over 5,000, more than doubling its previous numbers. Labour insists its membership is stable, but has conceded it has a job on its hands to ensure the Green surge does not split the vote on the left allowing the Conservatives to hold seats they would otherwise have lost. Bennett said: “This is a real landmark in the Green surge. To have doubled the membership of the party in less than a year is a real marker of the way in which people in England and Wales are seeing that we need real change in our society, not the business-as-usual politics offered by the three largest parties. “Talking to new members around the country, their reasons, and the trajectories that brought them to the Green party, vary a great deal. There are many former Labour and Lib Dem members who are fed up with parties that are happy to see society continued to be run for the benefit of the 1% and the continued trashing of our natural environment. Others are former non-voters, who see that to create the rapid change we need we need a new kind of politics. Some are former Tories, horrified by the government’s fracking fantasy or worried by its failure to tackle our fraud-ridden, corrupt, reckless financial sector. “These new members are putting their grassroots efforts and their financial support, as are many other supporters around the country, into making the 2015 general election transformatory. They understand there is a unique opportunity for a peaceful revolution delivered by enthused, energised voters.” All political parties tend to experience an increase in membership ahead of an election, and then subside in the intervening years, but the Greens appear to be achieving a kind of breakthrough. The party has been waging a long battle to persuade the broadcasters to allow the Greens into the election TV debates alongside Ukip and the other Westminster parties.
2323	2324	Paul Sykes bankrolls Ukip campaign for European elections 	"One of Britain's wealthiest men, Paul Sykes, has pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure Nigel Farage's UK Independence party triumphs in next year's elections to the European parliament. The Eurosceptic businessman, a former Conservative Party backer, is promising to bankroll Ukip's campaign in an election in which it is already expected to do well. His intervention will heighten concerns in the Tory ranks that the seemingly inexorable rise of Ukip could scupper any hopes they have of securing an outright majority in the 2015 general election. In his last significant foray into the political arena he donated a reported £1.5m to Ukip's 2004 European election campaign. His backing helped secure a stunning result for the party, which increased its number of seats from three to 12. Sykes, who has previously been estimated to be worth £650m, has given no indication of how much he is prepared to donate this time other than to say he will do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure Ukip is the largest UK party in the European parliament. ""I believe we have one last chance to stop the gradual erosion of our national independence. And that chance comes with the ,"" he said in a statement. ""If, as I hope and believe, Ukip score a stunning national victory, then the leaders of the other main parties will have no choice but to abandon their slavish support for the EU. ""Nigel Farage and Ukip are the last best hope for Britain. I am prepared to do whatever it takes to propel them to victory next year."" Farage said the backing of Sykes would help his party cause an ""intended earthquake"" in British politics. ""Paul Sykes has a long record of defending British democracy, ""he said. ""His involvement in this campaign is a significant boost for Ukip and will help us to cause our intended earthquake in British politics in the European elections next May."" There will be concern among Conservatives that a strong showing by Ukip next year will give them renewed momentum going into the general election. Many Tories fear that they will draw enough votes to deny the any chance an overall majority. Sykes was a strong supporter and backer of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s but broke with the party in 1991 over John Major's stance on the Maastricht Treaty. In the 1997 general election he selectively funded individual eurosceptic candidates. In 2000 he briefly returned to the Tory fold under William Hague only to be expelled the following year over his hardline views on Europe. He is reported to have given millions of pounds to various eurosceptic causes over the years. He said that he hoped success for Ukip in next year's election would compel the other parties to accede to calls for an early referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. ""So far they have stubbornly refused to listen. Maybe a comprehensive thrashing at the polls will bring them to their senses. Far better would be to accelerate the whole process and have that in/out referendum on the day of the general election in 2015,"" he said."
2324	2325	Ukip urged to cut ties with Christian group over gay ‘depravity’ comments 	A Ukip-authorised Christian group has been condemned for distributing a newsletter that refers to gay people as depraved sodomites and argues that they could be converted from a state of vice. On Tuesday night, the party distanced itself from the publication by the Christian Soldiers of Ukip but was facing calls to categorically cut all ties with the group, which holds events annually at the party’s conference and has previously published articles by the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage. The comments emerged in an article about last year’s Manchester Pride event, which was described in the Christian Soldiers newsletter as an “annual parade of depravity”. It said: “Thousands of people proclaiming their pride in their depravity paraded through the streets watched by multiple thousands of supporters applauding the display of wickedness and seeking to drown out the voices of the few crying in the wilderness. It went on to suggest that gay people can be “converted” away from their “vice”. “There are those who say that we shouldn’t be witnessing at these events because they are given over by God to this vice as per Romans Chapter 1. While this is undoubtedly true of many, it is not true of all because homosexuals are being converted. The same could be said of most sinners. “Please write to Asda and tell them that as a Christian you will no longer shop with them because of their support for the ‘gay march’ in Manchester which took place in front of little children during the day.” The newsletter drew attention to the presence of police officers and teachers at the parade, suggesting this was inappropriate. “There were two floats representing teachers unions: the NAWT and the NUT. As the NUT passed the witness, one of their number taunted the Christians over a loudspeaker. He kept repeating: ‘We teach your children.’ One wonders just how many Christians who send their children to state schools are bothered by this. Well they ought to be!” Ukip has been attempting to stress its openness to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender members despite its opposition to same-sex marriage and controversies over homophobic comments made by some associated with the party. A Ukip spokesman described the Christian Soldiers group as “authorised but not official”, adding: “They do not represent the party or its policies. This leaflet was recently brought to our attention. Authorised groups are not allowed to invent Ukip policy and we do not consider that this leaflet is of an acceptable standard to be associated with the Ukip brand.” Peter Tatchell, a leading gay rights campaigner, called on the party to go further and discipline those involved in the homophobic remarks. “These intolerant, inflammatory views are very similar to those expressed by the British National party,” he said. “These opinions are not isolated and they are being repeated by Ukip members all over the country.” Elizabeth Biddulph, a leading member of Christian Soldiers of Ukip, stood by the group’s decision to publish the article, which she said objected to the way some teachers on the pride march had shouted at Christian protesters. “It’s the shouting. It was the way these men who were half dressed were taunting the Christians who were there singing hymns,” she said. Asked about whether it was endorsing the idea of gay people being “converted” away from vice, she said: “It’s for Christians. Most of them are born again and that is their belief. It’s free speech between people who share the same view unless we live in Soviet Union or Nazi Germany censoring what people believe.” She added that the newsletter had a disclaimer on the back making clear that its views should not be taken as those of Ukip and the party had not previously objected to any of its newsletters.Meanwhile, a Ukip general election candidate has quit in relation to an internet posting that referred to gay people as “perverts” and “paedophiles”. Donald Grewar apologised for his “foolishness” after it was reported that he backed a post about same-sex marriage on the BNP website and another post by the English Defence League calling for “no surrender to militant Islam or political correctness”. Ukip also found itself at the centre of a controversy about religious rights after the party backed the British Veterinary Association and RSPCA in calling for a ban on non-stun slaughter. A Ukip spokesman said on Tuesday : “We see no reason why religious groups should not take into account the concerns of animal welfare when carrying out slaughter. We find the government response to this issue is weak, lazy and bordering on spineless. It says it would ‘prefer’ animals to be stunned before slaughter but that it must ‘respect the rights of Jewish and Muslim communities to eat meat in accordance with their beliefs’.”
2339	2340	Green party threatens legal action as Ukip gets seat on TV debates 	The major TV broadcasters faced a deluge of criticism and threats of legal action on Monday when they proposed to include Ukip, but not the , in the planned TV leader debates in the general election next year. The plans were rejected by David Cameron, the , George Galloway and the nationalist parties, suggesting the apparent fracturing of the three-party system is going to make it harder than in 2010 to secure a cross-party political consensus capable of seeing a repeat of the pivotal 2010 TV debates. Sky, the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 set out a joint proposal that Nigel Farage should join Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and for one debate. In addition there would be one debate involving Clegg, Miliband and Cameron, as well as a single head-to-head between Miliband and Cameron as the two potential prime ministers. There is already a separate joint proposal from the Guardian, the Telegraph and YouTube for the leaders to take part in an online debate to engage younger audiences. The Green party says it is inexplicable for Ukip to be given a platform when it is the Greens who have had an MP for four years, and polled at a higher level for many years. The broadcasters point to the consistent high poll rating of Ukip, as well as its showing in the European elections. , the Green party leader, told the Guardian: “We are deadly serious about taking legal action over this, and seeing how we can raise the necessary funds. The public want a serious debate in which they hear the full range of views, including a party that stands up against Ukip on immigration.” She said her party had proposed two debates involving the five parties and one between Miliband and Cameron. The Greens won the rare support of Cameron, who is seen as the leader most wary about a repeat of the 2010 debates, but also the most concerned about the potential inclusion of Farage. He said: “I am in favour of TV debates but you have got to make sure you can come up with a proposal everyone can agree to, and I can’t see how you can have a party in that has an MP in parliament, but not another party.” Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Treasury chief secretary, said: “I don’t accept that Liberal Democrats should be excluded from any of the debates. We’re a party of government, another coalition, a hung parliament is a potentially likely outcome of the next election, and so I think it is right that as last time, we should continue to have full Liberal Democrat participation in all the debates.” Miliband, previously an advocate of three debates involving the three largest Westminster parties, said he regarded the proposals as a “positive step forward”. He added: “I hope David Cameron is not going to put up false obstacles to these TV debates happening. Frankly he should be saying these TV debates will happen, they must happen during the campaign, for my part I’m going to make sure they do.” Farage was the most enthusiastic. “The decision is better than it could have been,” he said. “It does at least recognise the increasing popularity of Ukip. However, if the political landscape continues to change we would expect and ask for inclusion in a second debate.” The nationalist parties said the proposal reflected a media-driven obsession with Ukip. The format for 2015 would see three different styles of debate. Sky News and would broadcast the head-to-head contest between Cameron and Miliband, which would be chaired by the former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, with Sky News’s Kay Burley introducing the programme and presenting post-debate analysis. The BBC would broadcast a similar debate to the 2010 format where the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders would be pitted against each other. This would be presented by David Dimbleby. ITV would have a four-way contest between the Conservative, , Liberal Democrat and Ukip leaders. This would be chaired by the ITV presenter Julie Etchingham. The inclusion of Dimbleby, soon to be 76, was criticised by Sky’s Adam Boulton who told MediaGuardian that he should have stepped  down to allow a “fresh start”. The three debates would be more spread out than they were in 2010, taking place on 2, 16 and 30 April. As well as live studio audiences, comprising members of the public, questions would be provided to the leaders using social media to ensure the widest possible audience engagement. Each broadcaster would make their debate available live to all other outlets. Privately, broadcasters involved in the proposals blamed the political parties and particularly the Conservatives for not sitting down to discuss proposals following the 2010 election.  “The Tories just refused to engage,” said one, blaming the residual belief that the decision to take part alongside Nick Clegg last time could have cost the a majority.  There is also the separate initiative, announced in May, for an online debate broadcast on Google-owned YouTube in conjunction with the Guardian and the Telegraph. The proposal focuses on engaging young people online and aims to break the TV monopoly on the pre-election debates in 2010. Chris Birkett, a spokesman for the Digital Debate Campaign, told Sky News the media industry was changing. “Just because broadcasters did it last time why should they do it this time?” he said. He stressed that with more than half of people under the age of 44 get their news from the web rather than television, using Youtube made sense. “It’s time politicians moved into the digital age.” The Labour MP Tom Watson said an online debate would appeal to a wider audience: “There is a younger audience, a more networked audience, the sort of people who follow Question Time on Twitter but don’t bother turning on the need a look-in this election as well.” Watson said broadcasters should go ahead with the debates even if not all the party leaders agreed to take part. “I don’t know whether the broadcasters would have the bottle to do that but they should,” he said. “You shouldn’t allow a prime minister of the UK to run away from holding himself to account.” At the launch of the Guardian bid, Alan Rusbridger, its editor-in-chief, said: “The digital world has become an increasingly vital democratic tool and forum for debate, and it’s imperative that politicians understand and embrace the opportunities afforded to them by it.”
2340	2341	UK voters: ‘Cameron running scared of TV debates’ 	Britain’s voters are determined that the pre-election leaders’ debates should go ahead – and would favour serious consequences for leaders who duck out of them. That is the message of an ICM poll commissioned by the Guardian as part of its , to stage one of the debates. The research comes as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky revised proposals for TV election debates and said they would “empty chair” party leaders who refused to take part. The survey was conducted after that the Greens did not constitute a major party prompted David Cameron to suggest he would not take part unless they were given a place, sparking a controversy that has had and smaller parties issuing competing demands about the format. Even though Cameron’s demand for the inclusion of the Greens has now been accepted, the refused to confirm on Friday that they would participate, with one Tory source saying that the proposed timing remained a key objection. The two planned debates on BBC1 and ITV have since been revised to include the , SNP and Plaid Cymru, along with Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage. The third debate, a head-to-head between Cameron and Miliband due to be broadcast jointly by Channel 4 and Sky News, would go ahead as originally envisaged. The ICM survey finds that although voters agree with Cameron that the Greens should be included, they suspect his motives for making the argument – believing that he is running scared. Overall 64% feel it is important for the leaders to face each other before the election, against 35% who believe it doesn’t matter much. In the event that one leader declines to take part, 21% agree that “the debates may as well be cancelled” and 38% believe they should proceed anyway – with the missing party represented by an empty chair. This is, in effect, the tack the broadcasters signalled they would take – that they would press on regardless of any invited leaders choosing not to attend. But 26% of voters would go further and bar the party of the non-participating leader – most likely the Conservatives – from the right to air party political broadcasts. Ofcom’s ruling on the Greens, who hit , is deeply unpopular. Just 13% of voters would favour the format implied by its ruling – a debate between Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and Farage – while 60% want to see Natalie Bennett of the Greens represented too, and 7% would favour a rerun of the 2010 formulation, when the debates were restricted to Cameron, Clegg and the then Labour leader, Gordon Brown. Nine per cent would prefer the cast list was restricted to Cameron and Miliband only. The prime minister may be on the right side of the argument about the Greens so far as most voters are concerned, but they do not regard him as neutral: 49% say he is “only arguing about the cast list because he’s running scared”, whereas 44% disagree with that suggestion. There is overwhelming support for the parties and the media agreeing a format between them, without the regulators getting involved, something 76% would like to see, against 20% who disagree with that. The survey found that more people engage with politics online than in other ways: 28% of voters have commented online in recent months, whereas 8% have called a TV or radio phone-in, 8% have written to a newspaper and 22% have got involved in some other way. But there is evidence of apathy too: 46% had not discussed politics at all over the last six months. Chris Birkett, the campaign director of Digital Debate, said: “This poll underscores that there is huge public appetite to see the main five UK party leaders take part in a debate. It’s time to break the impasse and give Britain’s voters what they’re calling for, and in a format that taps into the new ways that people are engaging with the issues that affect them. “The proposal from the Guardian, the Telegraph and YouTube – free from Ofcom interference and available for all the broadcasters to use – offers exactly that.” Support for the idea of an online debate is at 62%, rising to 77% among those aged 18 to 24. Seventy-five per cent of those polled endorsed the more familiar television format. There was further evidence of voters’ determination that all voices should be heard in the debate when a question was asked about the principle of who should be invited: 70% felt that “any serious party putting candidates up across Britain should be included, irrespective of size”, whereas only 27% disagreed with that. , Ukip, the Greens, the SNP and Plaid Cymru all welcomed the revised proposals published by broadcasters on Friday, although Ukip said the seven-party debates could be “cumbersome”. The Lib Dems complained about Clegg being excluded from one of the debates, although party sources signalled that this was not a make-or-break issue that would keep Clegg away. The only official reaction from the Conservatives was a one-line statement saying the new plans were “part of the ongoing discussions”, but a party source said Cameron had always said he thought the debates should take place before the election campaign proper got under way, not during April, as the broadcasters are proposing. A Lib Dem source said that the latest Tory stance was “preposterous” and that Cameron should “stop coming up with garbage justifications for being chicken”. The DUP and Sinn Fein have protested about their exclusion from the proposed debates, and the Tories, who privately fear that debates would be a vote loser, will be hoping ongoing objections could yet scupper them. But the broadly positive response from the other six parties that have been invited means the Cameron could be forced to choose between capitulating and taking part, or allowing debates to go ahead without him.

The first minister of Scotland said people who didn't want to vote for any of the candidates would be perfectly entitled to write ""none of these clowns"" on the ballot paper. Speaking at a Scottish referendum event at Dundee university, the Scottish National party leader was asked whether he supported compulsory voting after the recent European elections: turnout in was 33.5%. ""I don't think it will happen, but it's one of my heresies that I like the idea of compulsory voting,"" he said during a question and answer session in the university's 5 Million Questions series on the referendum. ""I think there's a lot to be said for it."" He admitted few of his colleagues supported the policy. ""I raised this with colleagues but I didn't get very far. I don't think it will ever get introduced because it's against accepted political culture. But I don't think the Australians are wrong on this."" , all voters are legally required to register and cast a vote in federal elections, byelections or referendums, or face a A$20 (£11) fine or up to A$170 if the case goes to court. Salmond said he did not believe compulsory voting would be needed in the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September, because many polls suggested the turnout will be at least 80%. He said voting rates could be boosted with less controversial measures, including voter education and involving more under 18s. The Scottish referendum will give 124,000 16- and 17-year-olds in Scotland the vote for the first time. Salmond also admitted he had been unwise to be seen to praise for restoring Russian national pride and praising aspects of his leadership in an interview with the former Labour spin doctor Alistair Campbell in March for GQ magazine. He told David Torrance, his biographer, that ""I should've maybe been more careful in my language"" in the interview with Campbell, but insisted his critics had deliberately misrepresented what he had said."
2349	2350	Labour lead falls as Greens hit 20-year high in Guardian/ICM poll 	Labour’s lead is down to three points according to the latest Guardian/ICM poll as data shows that the combined score for the three main parties is at an all-time low. Ed Miliband’s party is not trusted to run the recovering economy, but the modest Tory rise is accompanied by rising concern about the NHS, seen by voters as the No 1 issue. The Conservatives gain two points to reach 30%, while Labour remains unchanged at 33%. The fall back three points to just 11%. “The parties we used to relegate to the margins with the term ‘others’ are now moving centre stage,” said Martin Boon of ICM. “The combined forces of all those outside the old LibLabCon triopoly has never been stronger during three decades of Guardian/ICM polling.” Ukip is also down three points at 11%, while the big winners of the latest monthly telephone survey are the Greens, up four points on December to 9%, their highest level for over 20 years according to ICM data. Other smaller parties, most importantly the Scottish National party, have also advanced this month – the SNP’s combined score inches up one to 7%. With the media dominated by reports of the winter pressures facing the NHS, the health service has cemented its place among the public as the most important policy topic for the election. When respondents were pushed on which single issue would be most important to their vote , the NHS was already top. But with growing queues at A&E, it is now more important than ever. Of those polled, 31% name the NHS as their top priority, a rise of seven points since autumn. The salience of most other issues falls – with second-place immigration dropping back one to 19%, and “jobs, prices and wages” sinking three to 14%. The declining political significance of the economy appears to be the flipside of easing financial anxieties. Right through the credit crunch, ICM ran a tracker question about people’s confidence in “the economy, your finances and ability to keep up with the cost of living”, and frequently totted up large net negative scores. But by September 2013, the economic optimists and pessimists were evenly matched, respectively numbering 50% and 49%. Today, the mood is much more upbeat – with 61% of Britons saying that they are confident, and just 38% saying that they are not. This recovering economic mood is sapping strength from Labour: only 15% now say they would trust Ed Balls and Ed Miliband as the team best able to manage the economy properly. By contrast a far higher proportion, 37%, put their faith in David Cameron and George Osborne, giving the Tories a record 22-point advantage on the economic question, which they hope will be decisive in May. But the electorate is not in a mood for gratitude: another 44% of respondents say that they would trust neither team. And as economic anxieties ease, worries about the health service intensify. Only 11% of voters believe it is working well, against 22% who judge it is feeling the squeeze but coping. That compares with 28% who believe it to be “struggling and not delivering services it should”, and an even more worried 36% who believe it isn’t coping at all, and “in danger of ceasing to exist in the form that Britain has known it”. While health continues to be a Conservative weakness, the Tories can take some comfort from a question regarding the blame game for rising A&E waits. A substantial minority, 38%, blame “reforms and financial choices” made by the coalition, but a slender majority – 52% – regard the root problem as being “budgetary pressures and mismanagement which would be much the same under any government”. With many pundits now predicting another hung parliament after May, respondents were also asked about what they would want to happen if there is no clear winner. Go-it-alone minority governments emerge as particularly unpopular, with only 8% favouring the trying to rule without a majority, and an even smaller sliver of 3% of electors favouring a minority Labour administration. Among various multiparty ruling configurations, the most popular option – preferred by 19% – was a Labour-led administration including both the SNP and the Greens. The second most popular option would be a Conservative-Ukip coalition – the choice of 15% – while a Labour-Lib Dem coalition and a second Conservative–Lib Dem arrangement were each preferred by 13%. A “grand coalition” of and the Conservatives is preferred by 9%. “England may not love coalitions”, said Boon, “but it is certainly learning to live with the idea of multiparty government. Voters’ views on what should happen in a hung parliament – with a large majority preferring some form of multiparty rule – bear out the overall message of this month’s poll. The old political tribes are losing their grip.”
2352	2353	Ed Miliband says David Cameron is 'running scared' of election encounters 	" is running scared of any general election television debates because he failed to secure a breakthrough against Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg in 2010, Ed Miliband said yesterday. The Labour leader called for a repeat of the 2010 debates, which would lead to the exclusion of the Ukip leader , to make it more difficult for the prime minister to avoid the encounters. Miliband said that reviving the so-called three by three debates – three debates involving the leaders of the three main parties during the three-week general election campaign – was the best way of guaranteeing their survival. He told the Guardian: ""The big challenge we are going to have in relation to the leaders' debates is getting all three leaders into a debate. David Cameron is desperate to avoid having these TV election debates because all of the conventional wisdom on the Tory side is that they didn't do him any good last time. He will try and do anything to avoid these debates. ""That is why we have said: we had the debate with three leaders last time. Same format – three debates, three leaders – let's have that. If the broadcasters want to invite other people, that is a matter for them. But I think our best chance of getting Cameron into the debates is to say we are going to have the same format as we had last time."" There has been speculation that Cameron will try to avoid the 2010 formula, and possibly kill off the debates altogether, by changing the format. This could include holding debates before the formal election campaign. Some of Cameron's advisers believe the debates in 2010 undermined Tory attempts to present their candidate as the fresh face of British politics because Clegg performed strongly. Miliband acknowledged that the revival of the 2010 format would cost Farage a place in the debates. Asked if he were in charge of drawing up the rules whether he would include Farage, the leader said: ""No. I think the format we had last time with parties that have representation in parliament is a good format. In the end, it is for the broadcasters to decide who they invite. They have got … to follow their rules … I am not that interested in Nigel Farage. I care about debating with David Cameron."" Ukip has been declared a major party by Ofcom for the European parliamentary election campaign in May because of its number of MEPs and its strong showing in polls. This means the broadcasters have to give Ukip the same treatment as the other major parties. Farage will press for similar treatment in next year's general election if Ukip wins the European elections. It is understood that Ukip will struggle to win this status because it does not have an MP. Aides to Miliband said including Farage in the 2015 TV debates would not be a deal breaker. But Miliband is keen to revive the formula from 2010 to ensure that Cameron cannot duck out. An aide said: ""We do not want to give David Cameron an excuse to walk off the pitch by accusing us of moving the goal posts. We have never told the broadcasters that Nigel Farage or anyone else would be a deal breaker. Instead, we are saying that the starting point for the negotiations should be what was agreed last time with David Cameron and . Our key priority is to get debates between Ed Miliband and David Cameron who are both running to be prime minister."" The remarks by Miliband came as Clegg reflected on his second consecutive ""defeat"" at the hands of Farage in their final television debate on the EU. The deputy prime minister said he fully expected to lose on the grounds that it was extremely difficult to dispel decades of ""myth-making"" on the subject and counter what he described as the simplistic and populist views of the Ukip leader. Speaking on his weekly LBC radio phone-in show, Call Clegg, the deputy prime minister said: ""I don't feel bruised at all. I'm delighted we've had this debate. The debate has now finally started."" Cameron dismissed both Clegg and Farage as ""quite extreme"" over Europe, adding slightly dismissively that he did not ""have a dog in the fight"". Using a phrase taken from the pre-2010 election leaders' debates, the prime minister told BBC Breakfast: ""It doesn't concern me because on this one I do not agree with Nick. I have a very different view about Europe: I want real change in Europe."""
2361	2362	Now Ukip is feeling the effect of protest vote politics 	"Newark, the Tories will hope, is Ukip's Stalingrad, the decisive moment when the purple tide is driven back and Nigel Farage's demoralised ""People's Army"" scatter to weep into their real ale in the nearest saloon bar. The Tories' temporary unity – better described as a ""pre-election truce"" – would have been at risk, had the result gone otherwise. David Cameron's strategy of defusing the Ukip surge by promising an EU referendum and beefing up the anti-immigration mantra has merely played into Farage's hands, shifting political debate on to terrain where Ukip flourishes. Ukip would still have that precious commodity: momentum, the ""big mo"". Cameron would have been in big trouble and with limited room for manoeuvre. It is easy to write the Ukip response: the fact that a 22% leap in our vote is portrayed as a failure just underlines what dizzying heights we have reached. This was number 258 on our target list, and lacked the older, non-university-educated, insecure working-class voters we depend on. Combined with the Tories – the most successful electoral force in the world – throwing every last resource at keeping the seat, we could never have won. But Newark exposes why Ukip are doomed under first-past-the-post. Ukip is a protest vote, but we have now witnessed the birth of a protest vote against a protest vote. are supposed to be easy mid-term hits, and this one was called after a Tory MP had to resign because of the whiff of good old-fashioned sleaze. Chris Bryant, the Labour shadow minister who led his party's Newark operation, talks of a complex ""pentangle of switching"": some voters moved to Ukip to give Cameron a kicking, others who traditionally voted Lib Dem as an ""up yours"" to the political establishment have slipped over to the Farageists, and so on. But many Labour and Lib Dem voters clearly voted tactically to keep Ukip out. Ukip's glass ceiling of support has been exposed. Under our current electoral system, having a core vote which is spread disparately across the country is pointless from the perspective of winning seats. If you're a political geek, check out Electoral Calculus, a website which allows you to spend the afternoon typing in seat predictions at the next election. If Ukip wins 20% next year, the website points out, they are still unlikely to win a single seat. Unlike even the besieged Lib Dems, they are unable to concentrate support in any given constituency. The national polling explains why. Ukip are supposed to be a symptom of popular anger at the political elite, but – according to an ICM poll in March – they are the least liked and most disliked party. According to YouGov, while 28% of people had a positive view of Ukip back in 2009, it's now just 22%; and while 37% viewed them negatively five years ago, that has now jumped to 53%. The Ukip vote is dwarfed by the ""can't stand Ukip"" vote, and that is a formidable obstacle to them winning a seat. This is what makes them different from the Lib Dems, their predecessors as the ""None of the Above"" party. Difficult though it now is to imagine – with Nick Clegg having gone from approaching the popularity of Winston Churchill to that of the ebola virus – pre-coalition Lib Dems did not have much of a stigma among the wider population. That's why they excelled at winning byelections – that and cynically opportunistic campaigning which drives Labour and Tory activists doolally. There is a debate raging on the left about how to deal with Ukip. Some believe that it is counterproductive to label Ukip – let alone its voters – as racist, lest it fuels a sense of the muesli-eating, sandal-wearing ""liberal elite"" closing ranks to shut down debate. Others believe that failing to stand up to bigotry spewed by Ukippers allows the terms of political debate to be shifted, reversing the gains of the anti-racist movement as previously unacceptable bigotry returns to the mainstream. But the evidence does suggest that the stigmatising of the Ukip brand has imposed a clear limit on its success. Ukip is an unsustainable coalition, too. Ukip's leaders are uber-Thatcherites, but Ukip voters tend to be economically leftwing people whose anger has been directed principally at immigrants. That doesn't mean the Tories should crow too much. The near 9% swing against them in Newark is approaching the average by-election swing they've suffered since 2010. Crowing that Labour once held the seat is extremely disingenuous given boundary changes favourable to the Tories; and in byelections in Glasgow East and Glenrothes in 2008, the Tories suffered swings against them but still emerged the largest party in 2010. Neither should Labour get comfy, given Ukip has shown it can chip away at their support. But the limits of Ukip are now abundantly clear; and when an opponent's frontier has been exposed, it is easier to start driving them back."
2374	2375	David Cameron threatens to drop out of debates unless Greens invited 	The prospect of TV election debates between the party leaders has suffered a huge blow after said he will not participate in them if the Green party is excluded. Nick Clegg immediately responded with a tweet saying: “Come on David Cameron, the broadcasters have invited us, the public expect it, just say yes and stop making excuses.” The prime minister was responding to a draft ruling by Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, that the does not have sufficient support to qualify for “major party status” in the general election, but Ukip may have. Ofcom’s initial decision makes the Greens’ argument to be included in the TV leader election debates much harder to press successfully, although the party has until early February to make its case before a final decision in early March. Cameron has been eager to reduce the prominence of the TV debates, partly because he believes they sucked the life out of the rest of the campaign in 2010 and partly because he fears he might not benefit from a head-to-head with Ed Miliband. Come on David Cameron, the broadcasters have invited us, the public expect it, just say yes and stop making excuses. Cameron was careful not to rule out a TV debate completely if the Greens are excluded, but at the very least he has set a difficult challenge for the broadcasters. ITN asked: “Are you saying you are not going to go in as it stands, unless at least Greens are in?” Cameron replied: “Correct. I don’t think the current proposals work. You can’t have one minor party without having another minor party and I think that’s only fair.” Miliband responded to Cameron’s remarks by saying: “The prime minister should be able to stand on his record and stop running scared.” A Labour official added: “David Cameron is going to fool no one if he wants the public to believe he is walking away from the TV debates on a point of principle about the inclusion of the Greens.” Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, said the Ofcom decision was deeply disappointing, stuck in the past and failed to grasp the way politics was changing fast. It ignored the views of young voters, she added. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, branded Cameron “a chicken running scared”. Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat campaign manager, accused Cameron of using the Greens to duck TV debates, adding: “Not since the photos of Cameron driving huskies have green issues been so cynically harnessed to Tory interest.” The broadcasters have proposed three one-hour TV debates, the first involving the Ukip, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative leaders, the second Lib Dem, Labour and Tory. The final debate would be between Miliband and Cameron on the basis that one or other of them is likely to be prime minister. The Tories have been canvassing opinion to see if they could get away withjust one debate and will have to judge how much long-term damage they would suffer if they were seen as the party that blocked the debates. Ofcom stressed that it is for the broadcasters to decide who can participate in the TV leader debates, but its provisional ruling will encourage channels to stick to their position that the Greens should be excluded. Also on the table is a groundbreaking digital debate proposed by a consortium of the Guardian, the Telegraph and YouTube. A spokesman for the three companies said: “The Ofcom ruling does not affect the proposal for a digital leaders debate which would engage an entirely new audience in the national political conversation.” The parties have failed to reach agreement in principle on the conduct of the debates and likely contestants. Neither the Liberal Democrats nor Labour want to discuss the negotiations, fearing it would give the Tories an excuse to pull out. Ofcom, in its consultation issued on Thursday, said the decision on major party status would affect not only party election broadcasts but also the total amount of editorial coverage the parties receive for the election. It would mean, for instance, that commercial broadcasters would try to ensure that Ukip had more coverage than the Greens, but not necessarily as much as the other three parties. The Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, a prominent environmentalist, was among critics and said it was a “disgraceful, indefensible decision by Ofcom”. In its statement, Ofcom said its initial view was that the Green party (including the Scottish Greens) had not “secured sufficient support in previous elections and current opinion polls to be added to Ofcom’s major party list for the purposes of the May 2015 elections”. It went on: “The Green party has not demonstrated significant past electoral support in general elections. The Green party has performed better in some other forms of election, such as the 2014 European parliamentary elections, obtaining 8.0% and 8.1% of the vote in England and Scotland. “In terms of evidence of current support, the party’s opinion poll rating in Great Britain-wide polls has increased in recent months to 5.9% in December 2014 (4.0% on average during 2014).” Of Nigel Farage’s party, Ofcom stated: “Ukip has not demonstrated significant past electoral support in previous general elections, achieving 3.5% of the vote in 2010 and has not won a parliamentary seat at a general election. “Ukip’s performance in a number of other significant forms of election has, however, been stronger. Notably, Ukip has won two seats in parliament at recent byelections. “Ukip demonstrated a significant level of support in England and Wales in the European parliament elections in 2014 (29.2% England, 27.6% Wales) while its share of the vote was lower in Scotland (10.5%). Ukip also demonstrated significant levels of support in the English local elections (15.7% in 2014 and 19.9% in 2013). “Opinion poll data indicates that Ukip currently has significant levels of support in England and Wales and has the third highest rating in those polls after the Conservative and Labour parties. Opinion poll data in Scotland shows lower levels of current support.” The list of major parties is important for Ofcom’s regulation of election coverage, in particular requiring the relevant broadcasters to allocate at least two party election broadcasts to each major party ahead of an election. Ofcom said its current list of major Great Britain-wide parties consists of the Conservative party, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. In Scotland and Wales respectively, the major parties are joined by the Scottish National party and Plaid Cyrmu. In Northern Ireland, they are joined by the Alliance party; the Democratic Unionist party; Sinn Féin; the Social Democratic and Labour party; and the Ulster Unionist party.
2376	2377	Newark: tactical voting to keep out insurgent party – that's a new one 	" is supposed to work against the incumbent party. Newark may be remembered as the first byelection that shows it can work against the insurgents, because in part the result seems to be explained by an anti-Ukip tactical vote. ""My lifelong Labour mum is voting Tory today to keep Ukip out of Newark,"" the . Haig's mum wasn't alone. Labour and Lib Dem campaigners in the constituency both claim to have picked up evidence that some of their supporters were going to vote Conservative to ensure Ukip lost, and some Tories said they were hearing the same story from people pledging support to them. ""A lot of our voters had transferred to vote against Ukip to make sure Ukip didn't get elected,"" David Watts, the Lib Dem candidate, said on Friday, as he sought to explain why the Lib Dem vote shrunk to just 2.6%. Partly this may have been a reaction against Roger Helmer, the Ukip candidate, whose reactionary views on subjects such as homosexuality, rape and immigration have generated controversy. But Helmer himself used to be a Conservative MEP, and so anyone voting tactically against him would have been voting Conservative to keep out a former Conservative. It is just as likely they were voting against Ukip as a whole, and that anti-Ukip tactical voting has emerged as a response to the way Ukip hardened its anti-immigration stance before the European elections, with Nigel Farage, the party leader, complaining about hearing foreign languages being spoken on the train and saying people should worry about Romanian families moving into their street. Tactical voting, a byproduct of the first-past-the-post electoral system, has been a factor in British elections for decades. Most commonly it worked against the , with Labour or Lib Dem supporters switching to back the non-Conservative candidate most likely to win. It was a crucial factor in the periodic Liberal/SDP/Lib Dem byelection triumphs that eventually gave the Lib Dems a sizeable presence in the House of Commons, enough to make them a partner in the coalition. But the Lib Dems were able to exploit tactical voting in part because (before tuition fees) they did not arouse strong hostility. Farage's problem is that, while his party has grown increasingly popular, , and people are now willing to trade their votes to keep it out. According to YouGov, 37% of people said they felt generally negative towards Ukip in 2009. That figure has now shot up to 53%. Another poll shows that people are more likely to say they will definitely not vote Ukip (52%) than Conservative (49%) or (38%). Farage wants Ukip to be the ""earthquake"" that disrupts Britain's political establishment and, in the European elections (which use a proportional electoral system, not first-past-the-post), he did achieve his goal of the toppling the main parties. But in elections for Westminster he is finding it harder to achieve equivalent success. Newark was the fourth byelection in a row where Ukip came second. Tactical voting helps to explain why he may find making a further breakthrough particularly difficult."
2379	2380	Nigel Farage's expenses: what are the allegations and what does he say? 	" that Farage is not paying rent on his office, a former grain store in Lyminster, near Bognor Regis. This suggests the Ukip leader was paying £1,300 per month just for utilities, business rates and insurance on the property. The newspaper quoted David Samuel-Camps, a former office manager for Farage, saying that the Ukip leader used to write a cheque for about £700 a month to cover the entire upkeep of the office including equipment, phone bills and stationery. It also quoted him as saying that within this, utilities, business rates and insurance came to about £250 a month – which works out at around £3,000 a year. The newspaper also reported that a former Ukip official had reported Farage to the EU expenses watchdog because of the gap between the £1,300 per month (£15,500 a year) in allowances claimed for ""management and running"" and the £250 (£3,000 a year) estimate of the cost of rental, utilities, business rates and insurance under this category. received almost £200,000 – around £45,000 a year – in ""general expenditure"" for his Lyminster office between July 2009 and December 2013, excluding staffing. Within this total, he received £69,500 towards the ""management and running"" of his office – including rent, utilities, business rates and insurance. This averages out at about £15,500 a year, or £1,300 a month. Farage said the claims were outrageous and a politically motivated attack by the Times. He is taking legal advice and argues the information is originally from a tainted source, which the newspaper denies. The Ukip leader also says the taxpayer-funded allowances from the EU are not expenses as such, because there is no requirement to provide receipts. ""This is a wilful attempt by the Times to mislead the British public about how the European system works,"" Farage said. ""I don't claim expenses – there are no expenses. I didn't claim any expenses for an office. ""The way that it works is that as an MEP, whether from Britain or the other 27 countries, we get an allowance given to us every month. It is just over £3,500 a month each MEP is given, and we can spend it on a list of authorised activities – we can spend it on hotel bills, we can spend it on buying books, we can spend it on mobile phones – and if we want to, we can run an office as well. ""So it's an allowance – there are no receipts required, there is no compulsion to prove how any of the money has been spent."" Subsequently Samuel-Camps claimed he had been misquoted. He said Farage's office costs were originally ""some £2,000"" a month and were later reduced to around £700 a month – or around £8,400 a year. He also disputed the idea that utilities, insurance and business rates came to as little as £250 a month. ""At no time did I say that electricity, heating, and business rates at the office totalled less than £250 a month. I told you that I could not remember the individual amounts as it was over four years ago but they would have been in the region of £200 each,"" Samuel-Camps wrote to the newspaper."
2382	2383	Why are IFS and Treasury split on who shoulders most of austerity? 	“The decisions across this parliament mean the rich are making the biggest contribution to deficit reduction,” George Osborne, the chancellor, told MPs in his autumn statement last year. It’s a claim that coalition ministers have made repeatedly, backed up by a sheaf of distributional analysis graphs published by the Treasury with every budget and autumn statement, and it allows Osborne and his colleagues to argue that they have implemented austerity fairly, with those with the broadest shoulders paying most. But says the opposite. It’s full of useful political ammunition for Labour, but its key finding is that it is those households in the poorest 10% who have lost the most from the coalition’s tax and benefit changes in proportional terms, not the wealthiest. Households in the wealthiest decile have lost the most in cash terms, the IFS says, at almost £2,500 per year. But, as a proportion of income, this amounts to less than 3%, whereas those in the poorest decile have lost more than 4% of their income. The IFS is well placed to adjudicate on this. It’s an independent thinktank and it has established itself in the public eye, largely successfully, as the authoritative voice on tax and spending matters. Indeed, in the runup to the election, it has even where it will be publishing research papers looking at the conflicting claims being made by the political parties. is being published as part of that series. Statistics, though, are never straightforward, and the Treasury has responded to the IFS report by saying that its own figures show that “the richest 10% of households have made the largest contribution to reducing the deficit”. How can this difference be explained? Quite simply, because the IFS and the Treasury are looking at different figures. They have both produced charts looking at the cumulative impact of changes to tax and benefits introduced since the coalition came to power, in cash terms and proportional terms, on households by income decile. But their methodology varies. The key difference is that the Treasury does not include the cut in the top rate of income tax from 50p in the pound to 45p on the grounds that, because of the behavioural impact of the 50p rate (people taking steps to avoid paying), the cut actually cost the exchequer very little money. The IFS has taken it into account. The IFS also includes cuts to housing benefit, omitted from the Treasury data, and assumes a full takeup of benefits, unlike the Treasury, which makes allowance for the fact that some benefits are not claimed. All three of these factors result in the IFS data making the government’s changes look more regressive. But, unlike the Treasury, the IFS also takes into account cuts in pension relief for the rich, which have had a progressive effect. In its response to the IFS, the Treasury also pointed out that other research it has conducted, taking into account the impact of public spending changes on households, as well as tax and benefit changes, shows the top 20% losing more in cash terms and percentage terms than all other quintiles over the lifetime of this parliament. In cash terms, on this analysis, households in the top 20% have lost £1,927 per year – more than all the other households put together. The IFS also says that, if the tax increases introduced just before the 2010 general election are taken into account, then the richest 10% have lost out the most from tax and benefit changes over the last five years in proportional terms. But Labour says the coalition cannot take credit for that, because it was Alistair Darling who put the top rate of tax up to 50p. Labour is also highlighting the IFS’s finding that it is low-income households with children who have done particularly badly from the coalition’s changes. But, in its response, the party has not been using Ed Miliband’s line about “the squeezed middle”. That might be because the IFS says, overall, it is people on middle incomes who have done best out of the coalition’s changes. Middle-income working-age households without children are actually better off than they were in 2010.
2386	2387	David Cameron under growing pressure over TV debates 	The leaders of Labour, the and Ukip have written to David Cameron saying they will press ahead with television debates without him unless he agrees to take part. In separate but identical letters, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage told the UK prime minister it was unacceptable for him to refuse to take part. They challenged the broadcasters to provide an empty chair to represent the Conservative leader if he continued to dodge the events. Talks about the debates are continuing but Cameron is refusing to take part unless the Greens are included, because they are polling above the Lib Dems. This has led the prime minister’s critics to say he is running scared of the election debates, which the broadcasters have proposed takes place in three sessions before the election. One would include Cameron against Miliband, another would add Clegg and a third would bring in Farage. In their letters to Cameron, the three leaders wrote: “It would be unacceptable if the political self-interest of one party leader were to deny the public the opportunity to see their leaders debate in public. “Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last-minute change of heart. “These debates are not the property of the politicians and I do not believe the public will accept lightly the prospect of any politician seeking to block them.” Downing Street has insisted to the broadcasters that Cameron’s position is unchanged following the letter, which is that “you can’t have some minor parties in and not other parties in”. However, the fact that three other political rivals have teamed up against him will significantly increase the pressure on the prime minister to take part in the events. The Greens have said they are deeply disappointed not to be included in the contest and mounted a legal challenge against the decision, although this has been damaged by Ofcom’s view that they are not a major party. Television debates took place for the first time at the last election, and included then leader Gordon Brown, Cameron and Clegg. It is understood that BBC guidelines on impartiality and elections would not prevent the TV debates going ahead without the prime minister. Farage told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme that Cameron appeared frightened of debating immigration and Europe with him. “In 2010, did very badly in these debates and was seen to be the loser. I notice this week he’s launched his six priorities for the Conservative election campaign and of course he’s completely ignored the issues of immigration and Europe. I feel very strongly he would rather not debate these issues with me on national television.” He added that it was pretty clear to him the broadcasters could hold the debates within their impartiality guidelines whether Cameron turned up or not.
2390	2391	Patrick Mercer resignation puts spotlight on lobbying 	"To those who do not know the intricacies of parliament and its arcane rules, the reasons for , and pledge not to stand at the next election, will probably seem bizarre. Mercer was apparently approached by journalists posing as members of a lobbying company, who asked him to set up an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) relating to Fiji and its exclusion from the Commonwealth. APPGs are semi-official groups of MPs and lords, which can be started by any parliamentarian who can muster enough cross-party signatures from both houses. While many serve as focus points for hobbies or campaign causes of MPs, they serve a dual function as a notorious back door for lobbyists, who can use them to fund drinks parties, overseas trips and more for big businesses and governments. Yet all of the above is within the rules. The reason for Mercer's resignation, it seems, is not that he was willing to accept outside funding and start such a group, but that he failed to declare £2,000 of the proffered £4,000. APPGs have long been a subject of contention in the house. They require only limited declarations of outside interests, and often serve as social clubs: parliament's choir is established as a group, as is its rowing team. As a result, many serve as avenues for sponsorship to come into the house. The aforementioned choir, for example, received £65,000 in sponsorship from BT, while the rowing team receives £16,000 from Siemens towards the cost of parliament's boat race. Other groups get money from organisations even more closely tied to their interests: the APPG on beer, for example, exists to ""promote the wholesomeness and enjoyment of beer and the unique role of the pub in UK society"", and in furtherance of that receives more than £65,000 in total, with contributions from Diageo, Carlsberg, Punch Taverns, SABMiller and more. Parliamentarians can even enjoy free membership of WeightWatchers – declared as worth £235 a year – if they join the all-party parliamentary WeightWatchers group, to ""promote the long-term benefits to health of gradual weight loss"". The associate parliamentary health group, meanwhile, takes £8,400 apiece in ""membership fees"" from numerous pharmaceutical and healthcare giants, including Alliance Boots, Serco Health AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. In all, there are now almost 600 such groups, representing countries, illnesses, industry and more – with some MPs enjoying membership of dozens at a time. Last year, . Provided any benefits are declared by the group – and, in the case of visits, by individual MPs too – this is entirely within parliamentary rules. APPGs are not mandated to publish any minutes of their meetings, or details of whom they meet, but are able to issue passes giving access to the parliamentary estate. Several groups are sponsored directly or indirectly by foreign governments, and in 2011-12, such deals facilitated trips to 27 countries, including China, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Taiwan, Thailand, Israel and Liechtenstein for members of 15 different groups. Last year, a working group established by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and the speaker of the House of Lords looked into ""whether APPGs should be required to publish minutes and accounts; and the funding of APPG activities"" – but to date have failed to take any concrete action. More than a year ago, the transparency activist Heather Brooke, the woman behind bringing the MPs' expenses scandal to light, warned that all-party groups ""create the perception of lobbying through the back door"". The renewed focus on this longstanding parliamentary back door as a result of Mercer's resignation – and if Westminster rumours are to be believed, forthcoming stings on other MPs and Lords based on similar approaches – may bring this relatively obscure practice to wider attention. What the public might make of it all, however, remains to be seen."
2393	2394	Farage under fire over MEP expenses claims 	"Ukip leader is facing questions over the £15,500 in expenses he claims annually for office costs after it emerged he pays no rent on the small Bognor Regis property where he works. A former manager of the West Sussex office told the Times that upkeep of the converted grain store in terms of bills and other non-rental costs only amounts to £3,000 a year. That leaves £12,000 a year apparently unaccounted for. Ukip said Farage, a European parliament member, was ""confident he has abided by European parliamentary rules at all times when spending allowances."" Farage said: ""I don't pay rent on the office but I obviously pay for everything else. Whether it's the burglar alarm or electricity."" He added: ""About £1,000 a month is roughly what it is. Exceptionally I put more money in as and when it's needed."" However, the Times reported he has been referred to the European expenses watchdog by a former Ukip official over how he has spent about £60,000 of office expenses since transparency declarations about expenses began in 2009. MEPs are not required to provide receipts proving how they spend their expenses, with the EU saying it is a ""matter of honour"" that the money is spent correctly. The allegations emerged with Ukip riding high in the polls at around 20% as the Conservatives appeared to have taken a hit over former culture secretary Maria Miller's wrongly-claimed expenses. Last week, Farage said Miller had ""taken the mickey out of the system"" and called for David Cameron to allow the public to sack MPs who perpetrated serious wrongdoing. Challenged about Ukip's own expenses scandals among MEPs, he said: ""In the cases of the two individuals who behaved badly, I removed the whip and kicked them out of the party a long time before they were found guilty of anything."""
2394	2395	Ukip is the party with most reasons to be cheerful ahead of European elections 	Nigel Farage, in keeping with his status as the unconventional politician, does not talk down his party's chances in the –predicting that Ukip can create the long promised political earthquake on May 25, not just in terms of share of the vote, but also in seats. Many pollsters such as YouGov and Comres agree with him, although, due to the vagaries of the proportional voting system, the margin between securing a seat and not can be wafer thin. In the equivalent election five years ago in 2009, held during the long nadir of Gordon Brown's premiership, the secured 27.7% – 1% up on the previous round of European elections in 2004 and enough to capture 25 seats in the European parliament. Ukip took 16.5% (up 0.3%), capturing 13 seats. Labour fell to 15.7% (down 6.9 %), winning only 13 seats. The Liberal Democrats were on 13.7%, taking 11 seats. But significantly, nearly 15% of the vote in 2009 went to the Greens (8.6%) and BNP (6.2%). For different reasons, both parties are likely to see their vote drop. Miliband hopes to draw back some disillusioned leftwingers who drifted to the Greens, and Ukip knows it will benefit from the near implosion of the . Indeed it is arguable that the Ukip 2009 baseline is close to 20%. A YouGov poll published at the weekend showed Ukip had the backing of 34% among those certain to vote, compared with 27% for and 20% for the Tories. The poll was taken in the wake of the two TV debates on Europe between Farage and Clegg, in which Farage was deemed to have outperformed the Liberal Democrat leader. A ComRes poll conducted at the same time, citing people certain to vote on May 22, gave both Ukip and Labour support at 30%, compared with 22% for the Conservatives and 8% for the Liberal Democrats. In some regions, the east, the south-west and the south, Ukip should do better. Some polls have Ukip at 40% in the eastern region. Labour is hoping it has a potent weapon on its side – the likelihood that Labour voters will be coming out in the largely metropolitan and London local elections occurring on the same day. Labour is defending 1,788 seats in the local elections, 200 more than the Conservatives. In 2009, by contrast, the local elections were chiefly focused on the Tory shires, increasing the number of Conservatives going to the polls. In a contest where turnout will matter, Labour will have an in-built advantage. Miliband's chief worry will be whether Farage has the firepower to overtake the Labour vote in the Midlands and the north, as he promises to do in the next month. Although there is vast literature on the source of Ukip's working-class support, this will be a major test of the claim that Ukip has the most working-class backing since Michael Foot led Labour in the early 1980s. The election is going to be nervy for . His party is polling at 9% in the European elections, down 5% from the 2009 elections, the same level as the Greens in 2009, for whom 9% yielded just two seats. The system for electing European MPs is broadly proportional. The hurdle to secure a seat in a region is around 7% to 11% per region. So if the Lib Dems fall below 8%, they could suffer a total wipeout in the European parliament. Clegg may have been beaten in the television debates, but for his aides the publicity was vital just to keep his party in the contest. It will be comforting to the Conservatives to know that European elections, at least in the past, have not had huge consequence for the subsequent general election. Parties without representation in the House of Commons have averaged a joint share of 24% of the European election vote since 1999, but only 4% of the general election vote. It will be these kinds of figures that Cameron will be drumming into his MPs if, as seems likely, he comes third when the votes are counted on 25 May.
2398	2399	PM defends debate stance as Miliband accuses him of 'cowering from public' 	 has defended his decision not to face Ed Miliband in a head-to-head televised party leader debate ahead of the general election, after being accused of running scared. Cameron insisted that he wanted there to be a debate and that he was trying to “unblock the logjam” created by the broadcasters. He argued that if the debate was held once election campaigning had formally started after the dissolution of parliament on 30 March, it would distract from the important issues. The Labour leader renewed his call to Cameron to face him in the one-on-one debate proposed by broadcasters on 30 April, saying that the prime minister was “cowering from the public”. He said: “The British people deserve this debate. I’ll debate him any time, any place, anywhere. He should stop ducking and weaving and he should name the date.” On Wednesday, Downing Street made what it called a final offer to broadcasters that the prime minister would take part in just one debate featuring seven party leaders before the formal campaign begins next month. Hours after Miliband challenged Cameron to meet him “any time, any place, anywhere”, Downing Street ruled out a one-on-one debate after accusing the broadcasters of allowing the negotiations to descend into chaos. The intervention by the prime minister’s director of communications, Craig Oliver, prompted an angry backlash from the other political parties. Douglas Alexander, the chair of Labour’s election campaign, accused No 10 of an “outrageous” attempt to bully the broadcasters into dropping their proposal for a debate between Cameron and Miliband. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in show on LBC on Thursday morning, said he couldn’t get over the “lofty pomposity of the Conservatives”. He said: “It’s as if they think they’re ordering a drink in the drawing room of Downton Abbey, telling everybody else what they should do. It’s not for one party to grandly tell everybody else what’s going to happen.” He offered to stand in for the prime minister in a head-to-head with Miliband: “If David Cameron is too busy and too important to defend he record of this government, then I offer myself.” The former Liberal Democrat leader and chair of the party’s election campaign, Paddy Ashdown, accused Cameron of being “frit” and pointed out that the debate proposed by Downing Street would be held before the Conservative party had published its election manifesto. Alastair Campbell, former director of communications for Tony Blair, called the development “democratically wrong and morally cowardly”. He said the prime minister was “wriggling and weaselling” out of debates and he thought Miliband would probably persevere and take part in debates without Cameron. “Everybody knows that Craig Oliver has a brief to make sure these debates do not happen,” Campbell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He admitted that he had advised Blair not to take part in debates prior to the 1997 general election. “I was worried that the focus of the campaign would all be about these debates, but they’ve now happened and that was 20 years ago. And what’s more they happened because David Cameron, no less, said back in 2010 they were fundamental to the democratic process.” Campbell added: “If you go around saying that is the most terrible, weak, useless leader that we’ve ever had, why in that case won’t he debate against him?” A Ukip spokesman said Cameron was “acting chicken”. Party leader Nigel Farage, speaking on ITV’s Loose Women, said: “He’s sabotaged the whole thing. He’s now saying he’ll do one debate, but he’ll do it before the proper campaign starts so it’s not going to be a proper debate and Ofcom, the regulator, said there were four major parties in British politics – Lib, Lab, Con and us – and on that same day he said ‘well, surely the Greens have to be involved’. And now there’s going to be actually, a debate – if it happens at all – with more people than we’ve got sitting on this panel now. How is it going to work?” The Green party said Cameron’s “swerve” would further damage trust in the political system. “Not only is Cameron’s announcement cowardly but it also shows his contempt for the electorate,” the party said, adding that Natalie Bennett was very much looking forward to the debates. The Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, accused the prime minister of running scared. “This arrogance in trying to lay down the law is all about getting out of debates, not taking part,” she said. The row erupted on Wednesday after Oliver sent an email to the chair of the broadcasters’ leaders’ debate committee, Sue Inglish, to say he was making a final offer, by which Cameron take part in one 90-minute debate between the seven party leaders. The debate would have to take place before the dissolution of parliament, in the week beginning 23 March. Oliver wrote: “This is our final offer, and to be clear, given the fact this has been a deeply unsatisfactory process and we are within a month of the short campaign, the prime minister will not be participating in more than one debate.” The broadcasters issued a neutral statement in which they suggested they were still committed to holding more than one debate. In a joint statement, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News said the three debates between the three main party leaders in 2010 had been watched by 22 million people and had engaged voters. “The broadcasters have set out their proposals and continue to talk to all the relevant parties on an equitable basis. We will respond to the Conservatives’ proposal in due course.” The move by No 10 shows that Cameron is determined to achieve one of two goals: kill the debates altogether or ensure that they turn into what one senior Tory has described as a “democratic bore-athon”, that would dilute the impact of Nigel Farage. Oliver said the debate should include Cameron, Miliband, Clegg, Sturgeon, Bennett and the Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood. Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionist Party leader, should be allowed to make the case for why he should attend, said Oliver.
2409	2410	Nick Clegg says he fully expected to lose debate with Nigel Farage 	"Nick Clegg has said he fully expected to lose his debates on Europe with , arguing that it was extremely difficult to dispel decades of ""myth-making"" on the subject and counter what he described as the simplistic and populist views of the Ukip leader. Speaking on his weekly LBC radio phone-in show, Call Clegg, the deputy prime minister said he knew his views on were not popular but felt obliged to respond to Farage's opinions, which appealed to ""fearful and anxious"" people. Clegg said: ""I don't feel bruised at all. I'm delighted we've had this debate. The debate has now finally started."" An instant poll after the BBC2 debate showed viewers backing Farage by a clearcut 69% to 31%, suggesting that an often over-scripted Clegg failed to convince viewers that Ukip was selling the British people a ""dangerous con"" and a ""fantasy"". The Guardian/ICM findings were almost exactly matched by a separate YouGov poll for the Sun, showing that in a sometimes brutal debate, with both men accusing the other of lying, it was the Ukip leader who came out ahead by an even bigger margin than a week earlier. Speaking on BBC Breakfast earlier, , adding that he did not ""have a dog in the fight"". Clegg responded by arguing that Cameron and his Labour counterpart, Ed Miliband, did not have the courage to say what they thought on the issue. Asked by co-host Nick Ferrari when he felt he had lost Wednesday night's debate and the earlier outing, Clegg said he had been aware of the challenge from the beginning. He said: ""Going into the debates, when I first challenged Nigel Farage, I was acutely aware that I am making an argument that hasn't been heard for 20 years. For 20 years people like Nigel Farage and others have been merrily going around saying often totally fictional stuff about our membership of the that just hasn't been challenged. I wasn't going to reverse 20 years of myth-making in two hours. ""Also, Nigel Farage has a few, very simple propositions that are understandably very attractive when many people are fearful and anxious about what is going on in the modern world. He says we don't need to get entangled with problems elsewhere in the world, we don't need to allow any immigrants to come to this country, we can do everything on our own, we can disentangle ourselves from Europe – I can totally understand why people go, yes, that's what I want. ""That doesn't mean, however, that I should stop arguing what I believe to be right for the country in the long run. I totally accept that what I say might not be popular – clearly, as the polls have indicated overnight."" Clegg said he would continue to campaign on Europe, noting that anti-EU feeling was strong in several other European nations. ""There are populists from left and from right who are saying to people that the complexities of the modern world can all be solved by turning our backs on the modern world. I understand that's attractive,"" Clegg said. ""But I fervently disagree with it, and I'm not going to stop explaining what I believe in."" Cameron had earlier dismissed the views of both debaters: ""I didn't have a dog in the fight, as it were. The problem with this debate is both of the people taking part actually have quite extreme views. Nick thinks there's nothing wrong with Europe, and we shouldn't have a referendum. Nigel thinks there's nothing right with Europe and we should just get out and leave. They're both wrong."" The prime minister rejected the idea that Farage's views were little different to his own, and that the two could ""do business"" over Europe. ""He wants to get out altogether. He wants to turn his back on Europe and not recognise the fact that we've got to trade and compete in Europe,"" Cameron said. The post-debate YouGov poll gave Farage 68% and Clegg 27%, a big increase on the lead he chalked up last week in the first debate, broadcast on LBC radio and Sky News, which Farage won by 57% to 36%. The two men offered competing visions of what a modern Britain could achieve in or out of Europe, with Clegg trying to portray Farage as a man who shunned the modern world, living in the 19th century. The Ukip leader accused Clegg of wilfully lying to the British people. He called on voters to join his ""people's army"" to overthrow the political establishment."
2410	2411	Lord Grade criticises broadcasters for handling of TV election debates 	The former chairman of the BBC and ITV, Lord Grade, has criticised channel bosses for threatening to stage televised election debates without . The Tory peer said the consortium of broadcasters had been self-important, incompetent and shambolic during the recent negotiations over the debates. Grade, who was at the between 2004 and 2006 before becoming executive chairman of ITV, wrote in the Times: “Who do the broadcasters think they are? Their behaviour over the election debates leads me to believe they suddenly have grossly inflated and misguided ideas of their own importance.” He wrote that “for the first time in history” the broadcasters were “unequivocally playing politics” in seeking to force the Grade went on to warn the television executives involved that they are not “guardians of democracy”, arguing that the prime minister is free to refuse to take part in the debates and “people are free to comment on the choice he makes”. The intervention comes as the issue is set to be debated on the floor of the House of Commons. Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has triggered a discussion on the process to agree televised debates between party leaders ahead of May’s general election. The DUP leader, Nigel Dodds, has insisted if the Scottish National party (SNP) and Plaid Cymru continue to hold invites, his party should also be allowed to take part. But speaking ahead of the debate, Dodds said he was “quite content” for the big nationwide parties to debate the issues alone. He said: “It’s difficult to think of a recent political event more badly managed by the people who wanted it most. Whether the TV election debates last time were a good or bad thing for the general election campaign, it’s been the broadcasters who have most persistently campaigned for them. “They’ve chopped and changed formats, blinked under pressure, refused to consult constructively and now are absurdly threatening not to have the prime minister present. “My own party would have been – and is – quite content for the genuine, big parties to debate one another. But we’ve always said, if any UK regional parties are invited, we’re invited too.” “At the moment, due to the incompetence of the broadcasters, these debates are in chaos and may well not happen. In future, we need to follow the example of the US and have an independent commission arrange any such debates.” The DUP debate will follow a prime minister’s questions that could be dominated for a second week by talk of the debates between Cameron and Ed Miliband. The Tory and Labour frontbenches will also make contributions to the Opposition Day debate. 
2414	2415	Debate phobia shows Cameron is reluctant even to talk the talk 	Doubtless some arrogant broadcasters have not, in the words of Lord Ashdown, covered themselves in glory over the handling of the negotiations with the political parties over TV leader debates. Doubtless their plans were disturbed by the sudden arrival of the Greens and Ukip on the national stage, but no one needs to look far for the individual responsible for the apparent collapse of the election debates this time around. Anyone close to Downing Street knows that David Cameron’s aides had made the calculation months ago that appearing to run away from the debates was damaging, but not as bad as appearing on TV alongside . The only question was how credible Cameron could look when he pulled out, and whether the public really minds whether the debates take place or not. At present Cameron does not look that credible. His sudden desire for the nation to listen to the views of the Green party on social housing, or hear Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader, set out his views to a grateful nation on the future of Ukrainian conflict, is inherently absurd. The real reason is that despite the stickiness of the polls, Cameron calculates he is on course to win without the TV debates. The economy will see him home and any cynicism about his refusal to debate will add little to pre-existing cynicism about politicians. In that context, such debates merely become a gamble where none is necessary. A central feature of the Tory campaign is that Miliband is just short of a laughing stock. It would be deeply disturbing if, unmediated, Miliband appeared less dopey than Wallace and more worldly than Mr Bean. Moreover, incumbents normally struggle in election debates and, however naturally Cameron has donned the authority of a prime minister, he would have been on the defensive. Such debates would have been as much about his record, as the risk of Miliband. Miliband has been investing time and resources into preparing for the debate, including a day-long coaching session last Sunday. If Labour’s single biggest weakness is Miliband, it hardly makes sense to give him a 90-minute opportunity for voters to take a second look at him. Cameron makes a legitimate point that in 2010 the TV debates intruded too much. The buildup, the debate itself, the following poll, the reports from the spin room and the postmortem became the weekly cycle of the campaign at the expense, for instance, of much necessary discussion on the deficit, or indeed the possibility of a coalition. But that was in part due to the debate’s novelty, and their proximity to polling day. Some of the faults could have been ironed out before we were left with Cameron’s final offer to the nation on his availability during the campaign. There is a broader and important point about the accountability of politicians. Tony Blair, ever the showman, held monthly press conferences in an attempt to explain himself. Sometimes, if the timing was right, these events were a very difficult hour for the prime minister. Gordon Brown broadly continued the tradition. Cameron abolished them. He remains available for the occasional newspaper interview with a friendly proprietor and, at conference time, finds time for a 20-minute breakfast inquisition. But is Good Morning Britain, a revealing discussion with or three questions on regional radio interspersed with a Barry Manilow song. Some of that is understandable. The Westminster lobby can be a distorting prism for politicians. By comparison, in the 80s and 90s most political parties would begin their day’s campaign with a 45-minute press conference. Most newspapers and broadcasters got to pose questions for a party spokesman and the party election chairman. Lord Patten, the Tory chairman, would occasionally cut off an overeager inquisitor, saying this was a press conference not a Socratic debate. Thereafter the party leader would undergo lengthy interviews with expert interrogators, as well as phone-ins, regional radio and newspaper interviews. British leaders are now protected, sanitised and risk-averse, which is why figures like Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Kenneth Clarke have followings that transcend their parties. The irony is that we have more media than ever before, but less insight.
2421	2422	Peter Hain says Ukip could beat main parties in European elections 	"The veteran MP Peter Hain told Labour activists on Monday that the UK Independence Party could beat all three main parties in next year's . In an intervention, believed to be the first time that a major Labour figure has admitted that Nigel Farage's party could win next May's vote, he called for to begin mobilising for the elections. Addressing a fringe meeting organised by Unite Against Fascism, Hain said: ""We have got to take on the bigotry and the threat that Ukip represents."" Hain claimed supporters had found a ""home in Ukip"", adding: ""We have to recognise that this is a very dangerous form of populist politics. In an era when politicians are more despised than we have every been, there is a very anti-politics mood. ""I think [UKIP] could well win the European elections next year if there is not a big mobilisation against them,"" he said. Farage, who angrily dismissed claims that his party's rise allows far right organisations to prosper, has long argued that Ukip could win next May's European elections. Labour was beaten into second place in the 2009 European elections, but this time Hain believes that Farage's party may beat the Tories too. Until now, Labour has usually tried to portray Ukip as a threat to the Tories. But with Ukip bringing in , Labour insiders say the party must now take them on or risk losing ground in white working-class communities. At a meeting to discuss the rise of rightwing politics in Europe, the former cabinet minister and anti-apartheid campaigner claimed that Farage's party creates an atmosphere in which fascism can flourish, and called for a campaign to combat their rise. At the same meeting, said the current rise in European racism and fascism is an inevitable consequence of a worldwide recession. The rise of Ukip must be seen in that context, she added. Richard Howitt, East of England Labour MEP, said that Ukip's MEPs compete with their Tory counterparts to deny climate change. ""Make no mistake − Ukip is a second Conservative party. It's fascinating to watch how Ukip and Tory MEPs compete to deny climate change. The only green thing about the Tories is their envy at Ukip's rise,"" he said. Farage hit back at Hain's remarks, telling the Guardian: ""It is the contempt held by the old parties for the hopes and fears of the ordinary people of this country that drives people into political extremism. ""Offering a democratic alternative to their tired agenda keeps people out of extremism. Look at the rise of Golden Dawn in Greece, a phenomenon I predicted, after the EU overthrew the government of that country. ""It is the Labour Party that think their own supporters are bigots after all."""
2423	2424	Godfrey Bloom: no 'sane' person would enter politics these days 	"The former Ukip MEP has said no sane person from a professional background would enter politics these days because they would be vilified for holding convictions. Bloom is now an independent MEP for Yorkshire and Humber after he was criticised for calling women at a meeting sluts and hitting the Channel 4 News journalist Michael Crick over the head with a conference programme. He had previously been widely condemned for referring to Bongo Bongo Land when he was discussing overseas aid. , Bloom said the media coverage meant no sane individual from a successful professional background would now go into politics. He explained: ""The vilification and lies overwhelm anyone with conviction."" The politician said there was mock outrage in the media about his recent comments. He said: ""Is Bongo Bongo Land offensive? Only if I say it. Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, used it in his book Live From Downing Street last year and no one said a word. ""But of course he isn't me."" Bloom claimed his sluts remark – which he said was a joke – was met with more mock outrage, but not from members of the public. He then described being ""harassed by an awful little man with a camera in a London street"". Bloom continued: ""I swat him with a magazine, more horror and mock outrage."" He claimed to be pleased to be returning to the backbenches, but pitied the electorate who will only have a choice of ""grey, boring, stand-for-nothing politicians whose names you cannot even remember"". He concluded his article by saying: ""You're welcome to 'em."" When Bloom decided to stand down as a Ukip MEP the party leader, Nigel Farage, said: ""I'm very sorry it has come to this; he's been with us for 15 years, he's sat in the European parliament since 2004, he absolutely 100% believes in everything Ukip stands for and he's been a good, loyal MEP for us. It's a sorry state of affairs."""
2425	2426	George Osborne's budget undermining Tories, according to new poll 	"A month on from his budget, is emerging as a drag on his party's popularity, according to Tuesday's Guardian/ICM poll. Voters regard the chancellor as less competent in a crisis, less empathetic and less fair than the prime minister, who is himself now rating badly on all three counts. After rows over the budget's income tax cut for top earners and its new levies on pensioners, pasties and charity donations, 54% of the public dismisses the idea that the chancellor looks ""after the interest of the many, not the few"" – against 24%. That crushing 30-point margin suggests comprehensive rejection of any claim that ""we're all in this together"", the slogan Osborne used to sum up his approach to austerity in his previous budgets, but which he neglected to use this time around. and Nick Clegg both fail the test of championing the interests of the many over the few by respective margins of 19 and 12 points. Ed Miliband, by contrast, is trusted to favour the many by a wafer-thin 43%-42% margin. A large majority of voters (58% to 20%) likewise believe the chancellor does not ""understand people like me"". That makes his net rating on this score -38 points, while the prime minister scored -31, Clegg -17, and Miliband -15. But even in December, when the had the edge, Cameron scored only -25 points on this empathy question. Neither he nor Osborne would have expected to fare any better in terms of fairness or empathy after all the budget rows. They might, however, have hoped to prevail by looking competent. The Conservative governments of the 1980s were often perceived to be unfair, but ultimately triumphed as trusted managers, and until recently the coalition was thought of the same way. In December, by a 10-point margin, voters judged Cameron to be ""good in a crisis"". Today that positive has given way to a net negative score of -13 for him. The figures are worse for Osborne: voters reject the suggestion that he is good in a crisis by 48% to 21%, a net negative of -27 points. The saving grace for the Tories is that the voters are even more dismissive of their rivals' abilities when the going gets tough. Only 27% of voters rate Clegg as good in a crisis, against 57%, a net negative of -30. Miliband's ratings on this measure are even worse – 18% to 54%, which makes his net score -36, as against the -23 he notched up on the same question last December. These dire number help explain why, for all their misgivings, the public still give Cameron and Osborne a 13-point edge over Miliband and Balls on the question of who can be trusted to manage the economy properly. But the detail of the polling nonetheless suggests the budget has done deep damage. Previously solid support for the Conservatives among pensioners has fallen a way. Over the month, ICM charts the Conservative share of the 65+ vote declining sharply from 53% to 40%. Meanwhile, accusations that the government is neglecting the squeezed middle appear to be hitting home, with an especially big drop off in Tory support among the middling C1 and C2 social grades. Among C2 skilled manual workers, for instance, the Conservative vote share has declined from 39% to 26% over the month. Equally worrying for Cameron is the sharp falling away of support in the electorally-important Midlands and South. In both regions, the Tories have slipped nine points over the last month. The can take comfort from having put a floor under their slide in terms of voting intention. Their 15% showing, which is better than in many other recent polls, suggests that the party's controversial tack of diverting the sharpest criticisms of the budget towards the Conservatives may be paying dividends. While Clegg's personal ratings remain very bad, on empathy and to some extent fairness his ratings compare more closely to Miliband's than those of Cameron and Osborne. That suggests that the country lays the blame for any unfairness in the budget squarely at the Conservatives' door."
2431	2432	Green party’s flagship economic policy would hit poorest hardest, say experts 	The Green party’s flagship economic policy, the £72 a week “citizen’s income”, would hit the poorest hardest unless it was made more complicated by including a means-tested element, the leading advocate of the policy has conceded. The (CIT), which has given advice to the Green party and been repeatedly cited by the Greens, has modelled its scheme and discovered it would mean 35.15% of households would be losers, with many of the biggest losers among the poorest households. The trust’s research shows that for the two lowest disposable income deciles, more than one-fifth would suffer income losses of more than 10%, something one of the most leftwing parties in the election is unlikely to want to advocate. Malcolm Torry, director of the CIT, a small charitable research body, said: “I am not sure the has yet taken on our new research or the need to retain a means-tested element. We have only just published the new work.” The criticisms of the scheme, as well as doubts about costings, have led the Greens to make a tactical retreat, with the party’s leader, Natalie Bennett, saying detailed costings for the policy will not be available in the manifesto in March. She faced a difficult time when interviewed by on the BBC’s Sunday Politics on the subject, repeatedly arguing that any extra cost would be covered by reductions in the administration of welfare. Citizen’s income is an unconditional, non-withdrawable income for every individual, including children, given as a right of citizenship. The idea has won support in the past on both sides of the Atlantic from left and right, and was until 1996 a Liberal Democrat policy. It was finally rejected as utopian. It replaces personal tax allowances, and most means-tested benefits including jobseeker’s allowance, child benefit, the basic state pension and tax credits. The CIT, the charitable body that has done most to promote the policy in the UK, admits after modelling its proposal with the help of the Euromod model at the University of Essex that the complexity of the current welfare system has led to a major design flaw being revealed, including a big hit on the poor. Writing in the latest issue of the CIT’s newsletter, Torry states: “It is a pity that such a large number of households with low disposable incomes suffer such large losses on the implementation of what otherwise looks like a useful and revenue-neutral scheme. “But unfortunately, with that number of large losses, the scheme would be impossible for a government to implement, and we ought to look for an alternative.” However, Torry argues almost regardless of the level at which the citizen’s income is set, the poor cannot be compensated for withdrawal of both the personal tax allowance and means-tested benefits without the scheme becoming too expensive. In a bid to make the scheme more palatable, the trust has looked at retaining the central principle of a non-contributory scheme and the abolition of the personal tax allowance, but retaining other means-tested benefits such as tax credits, so depriving the scheme of the simplicity and administrative savings once promised. The revised scheme hits the rich hardest, but also requires a substantial increase in the basic rate of tax to 30%, as well as lifting national insurance to 12% of all income. The scheme still costs £24bn. Alternatively, the trust has looked at cutting the value of citizen’s income from £75 a week to just £50 a week, much closer to the value of a personal tax allowance. Torry told the Guardian that citizen’s income still has substantial advantages since even under this scheme it replaces a proportion of means-tested and other benefits, and total marginal deduction rates would be greatly reduced. The amounts of means-tested benefits received would be reduced through citizen’s income being taken into account when calculating benefits. In addition, for many households the reduction would offer the option of adding additional hours of employment and so escaping from means-testing. A Green party spokesman said: “The citizen’s income is one of the items the manifesto working group are looking at. The Green party manifesto will be launched at some point in March.”
2435	2436	David Cameron vows to 'stay in touch' after accusations of arrogance 	" has vowed to ""stay in touch"" with voters as he and George Osborne were condemned by a Tory backbencher for being ""arrogant posh boys"" who do not know the price of milk. In his most candid remarks about his government's performance, the prime minister admitted he has had a difficult month, conceding that an ""important mistake"" was made during the fuel crisis. ""There isn't a day in this job that you don't learn some important lessons and you've got to make sure you stay in touch and realise that as you get on with it,"" Cameron told the BBC in an interview on the local election campaign trail. ""One of the key things to learn is if you don't communicate what you are doing properly, then yes, you've got a problem. We need to deal with that. Sometimes we have got the action right but the message hasn't been right – the fuel strike. ""Sometimes a presentational mistake can be an important mistake. On the fuel strike issue … we have taken very effective action … But did we communicate perfectly at every stage? I think most people would say no, you didn't."" The prime minister embarked on a round of radio and television interviews on Monday as he attempted to rejuvenate the government ahead of the local elections on 3 May after a difficult month dominated by the fallout from the budget. The chancellor has been criticised for failing to anticipate a backlash over a cap on charitable donations and the so called granny and pasty taxes. A committee of MPs will on Tuesday give voice to criticism that Cameron leads a lackadaisical government when they blame a lack of strategic thinking for a series of policy mistakes. ""Policy decisions are made for short-term reasons, little reflecting the longer-term interests of the nation,"" MPs on the commons public administration select committee will say. ""Poor strategic thinking militates against clear presentation, which was evident in the aftermath of the budget and in response to the possibility of industrial action by tanker drivers."" The prime minister dismissed claims that he is too relaxed. ""I may look relaxed but I don't ever feel particularly relaxed in this job,"" he told the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson in an interview at the Airbus factory on the outskirts of Bristol. But Cameron admitted that he sets aside ""date nights"" with his wife Samantha. ""It's got to be possible to be a decent husband, a good father and a good prime minister at the same time,"" he said. The prime minister's fightback was marred when Nadine Dorries, the socially conservative Tory MP for Mid-Bedfordshire, launched a highly personal attack on him and the chancellor. ""There is a very tight, narrow clique of a certain group of people and what they do is act as a barrier and prevent Cameron and Osborne and others from actually really understanding or knowing what is happening in the rest of the country,"" Dorries told BBC1's Daily Politics show. ""I think that not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don't know the price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others – and that is their real crime."" Cameron, who has been criticised by Tory MPs for treating some of his backbenchers with ""sneering condescension"", sighed when he was told of her remarks. ""Look, I don't agree with Nadine,"" he said. ""She's got a very strong view about a number of things."" Sighing, he added: ""You have, sometimes, MPs who don't agree with you. My job is to try to run the country on behalf of the people in the country. People in this country – they are struggling to meet their bills, they are having a tough time. I understand that. That is why we have frozen council tax, that is why we have given people an income tax cut this year, that is why we are lifting people out of tax."" The prime minister then insisted he knows the price of milk. ""I do a lot of my own shopping. I go to Sainsbury's in Chipping Norton on a Friday or a Saturday. I do a lot of the family shopping. Sam does a lot of it on the internet."" Asked about the price of a pint of milk, he said: ""I pay just under 50p."" But Cameron was facing more pressure amid confusion about whether the European court of human rights advised the Home Office on the deadline for an appeal by Abu Qatada. Cameron told the BBC that the Home Office and the Foreign Office had discussed the deadline with the European court of human rights, adding: ""Their assumption, and the assumption and understanding, was Monday night [16 April]."" Earlier, in an interview with the Today programme, the prime minister was more clear-cut when he indicated that the ECHR had confirmed that 16 April was the deadline."
2436	2437	Scottish referendum: David Cameron and the Queen seek to ease tensions 	" and the Queen will hope to calm tensions after the heated Scottish referendum campaign when they make conciliatory statements on Friday after the formal declaration of the result. The prime minister is planning to make an early appearance in Downing Street to outline a package of constitutional reforms, amid increasing confidence in No 10 during the early hours of Friday that the pro-UK side would prevail. Cameron is expected to use the occasion to show that the coalition is committed to delivering the pledge, outlined by the leaders of the three main UK parties in the final days of the campaign, to deepen Scotland's devolution settlement. But Michael Gove, the Scottish-born Tory chief whip, made clear early this morning that the prime minister would present a balanced package to ensure that voters in England, Wales and Northern Ireland do not feel they have lost out. Gove even suggested that Scottish MPs may be banned from voting on English-only matters at Westminster as government sources said that the Barnett formula, which guarantees extra public spending in , would be part of the changes. , who is understood to have watched the referendum debate with close interest, is planning to issue a written statement in the afternoon. It is understood that the monarch, who was praised by both sides during the campaign, believes that it is important to send a message of reconciliation after the heated debates. In a rare intervention on the political stage the Queen said last weekend that she hoped voters would think ""very carefully"" before voting. Her remarks, delivered outside Crathie Kirk near her Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire after the Sunday morning service, were interpreted by the no camp as a helpful intervention. The prime minister wants to move quickly to show he will stand by his word as he confirms the timetable to devolve greater powers, over taxation and welfare, to the Scottish parliament. Cameron, and Nick Clegg issued a joint pledge after Gordon Brown warned the main UK party leaders that they needed to make a dramatic intervention to fight a late surge to the SNP. Cameron is facing calls from Tory MPs to balance the powers for Holyrood by denying Scottish MPs the right to vote on English-only matters at Westminster and to reform the favourable funding arrangements for Scotland in the Barnett formula. Claire Perry, the rail minister, became the first Conservative frontbencher to speak out when she warned against ""promises of financial party bags"". Gove, who has been canvassing opinion among Tory MPs, indicated that the prime minister is heeding the concerns of Perry and scores of backbenches. The chief whip told the BBC: ""If, as seems likely, there is a no vote then the prime minister will be saying more not just about the need to make sure that the interests of Scotland are protected but how we bring the whole UK together and what the means for Northern Ireland, Wales and England. The critical thing is there needs to be change in order to ensure that Westminster works better for the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland."" Gove ruled out the idea of an English parliament. But he suggested that the West Lothian question, which asks why Scottish MPs are entitled to vote on education and health in England while English MPs are unable to influence such matters in Scotland. He indicated that this could involve denying Scottish MPs to ability to vote on such areas. The indication from Gove that No 10 is prepared to restrict the voting rights of Scottish MPs may spark a coalition row after Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, ruled out the proposal on Wednesday. Labour, which holds 41 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, will be opposed to tinkering with the Barnett formula. It is understood that the prime minister will move to reassure Tory MPs who are alarmed at the favourable funding arrangements for Scotland enshrined in the Barnett formula which ensures that an extra £1,200 per head of public money is spent per head in Scotland. Many Tory MPs were alarmed when the joint guarantee by Cameron and the other UK leaders appeared to guarantee the Barnett Formula. But the commitment was carefully worded to guarantee ""the continuation of the Barnett allocation for resources"". It is understood that this means that devolving greater tax raising powers to the Scottish parliament will lead to a claw back in the Scottish block grant which is underpinned by the Barnett Formula. A command paper setting out the reforms will be published within the next few months. This will be followed by draft clauses on a proposed bill in the new year that will be formally introduced to parliament after the UK general election next May. Conservative backbenchers lined up to demand separate powers for English MPs shortly after the polls closed, underlining the pressure on Cameron to act. Many are angry at what they see as their leader's complacency that forced him to offer ""bribes"" to the Scots to stay in the last day of the campaign. Led by former cabinet minister John Redwood, up to 100 MPs could be prepared to veto the Scottish devolution package if England is not given what they consider to be an equal deal. Their core demands are that Cameron must address the West Lothian question – why Scottish MPs are allowed to vote on English-only issues – and the Barnett formula – the Treasury mechanism that divides up funding between the four nations of the union. They are unlikely to be placated if the prime minister simply says he will implement the McKay Commission, which recommended a greater say for English MPs on English issues without banning Scottish MPs from voting on any legislation. One of the new voices to pile pressure on Cameron was Boris Johnson, the London mayor and candidate for Uxbridge, who said Scottish MPs should no longer have a say on legislation that just affects England. He told Sky News: ""Let's not give any more sauce to the goose until we've given some sauce to the gander."" Liam Fox, a former Tory defence minister, also said the West Lothian question and the funding settlement between all UK nations would become ""unavoidable"" . Others to raise concerns included transport minister Claire Perry, Conor Burns, Andrew Percy, and Michael Fabricant. From Labour, Diane Abbott, a former shadow minister, and John Denham, a close adviser to Miliband, said it would have to be considered. Others senior figures in Labour, including Jim Murphy, the shadow development secretary, expressed reluctance to ban Scottish MPs from voting on English issues. Allowing this to happen would put any Labour prime minister dependent on Scottish MPs for a majority in a very difficult position. For example, Scottish MPs would potentially not be able to vote for a budget, after tax powers have been devolved."
2444	2445	Nigel Farage and Alex Salmond trade insults in battle of nationalists 	"The two most influential political leaders reshaping British politics outside Westminster traded insults after the Ukip leader and the SNP leader Alex Salmond responded accusing him of touting ""obnoxious"" policies. Farage warned that the protesters who forced him to flee a press conference in Edinburgh and seek police protection, had exposed a ""pretty ugly"" face of Scottish nationalism that is ""akin to fascism"". But the SNP's Salmond's fierce response exposed a fissure in British politics, as the Tories and Labour offered some support for Farage as they warned of anti-English feeling in . Farage claimed the protesters were filled with ""total and utter hatred"" of the English. The Ukip leader, who challenged Salmond to condemn the protest, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland: ""The fact that 50 yobbo, fascist scum turn up and aren't prepared to listen to debate I absolutely refuse to believe is representative of Scottish public opinion. It is not. If this is the face of Scottish nationalism, it's a pretty ugly picture. I have heard before that there are some parts of Scottish nationalism that are akin to fascism. Yesterday I saw it face to face."" But Salmond hit back at Farage telling the BBC: ""This is a man who doesn't like getting challenged because when the obnoxious views of his party are put to him then his bubble deflates very quickly and that is what we saw in his panicky interview this morning."" When asked if he condemned the demonstration against Farage, the first minister said: ""If there's been any law-breaking – and that's yet to be established – then obviously we condemn that, as we always do in Scotland, but you've got to get things into context. A student demonstration isn't the Dreyfus trial."" Liam O'Hare, the Radical Independence Edinburgh organiser who took part in the protest, denied his group were fascist. ""We're absolutely not. The people who demonstrated were internationalist. We opposed Nigel Farage coming as we believe in a society that welcomes immigrants, that welcomes people from all walks of life, wherever they come from, but doesn't welcome racists like ."" The row exposed the geographical limits of Ukip's recent success in the polls. Guy Lodge, a political analyst with the Institute for Public Policy Research, said Ukip was now becoming a magnet for English nationalist discontent with both the EU and with the UK. Recent IPPR polling found that 49% of Ukip voters wanted England to be an independent state and Ukip's recent high rating in the polls is largely a English phenomenon. ""One of the reasons Ukip are motoring along within England is that they are tapping into quite a strong sense of English national sentiment,"" Lodge said. Farage's ill-fated trip to Scotland continued with him . ""I'm sensing similar hatred from this line of questioning that I got on the streets yesterday in Edinburgh … Frankly I have had enough of this interview. Goodbye,"" he said. As he flew out of Edinburgh, Farage turned his sights more directly on the SNP, saying: ""I'm afraid there has been for a long time in Scotland an attempt to shout down and drown out any sort of debate. ""And I'm afraid that there are parts of the SNP and parts of the independence movement that are deeply deeply unpleasant. Everybody knows it and nobody dares say it."" The last Tory Scottish secretary Lord Forsyth of Drumlean joined with Labour and George Galloway in saying that the protest Farage faced on a visit to Edinburgh on Thursday had highlighted anti-English feeling in Scotland. Forsyth said the protest had highlighted an unpleasant side of some Scottish nationalists. He told the Guardian: ""There is an element that is not very pleasant. They are called cyber-nats and are a pretty unpleasant and nasty bunch. ""It is the worst aspects of nationalism – very inward looking and very self satisfied and rather unpleasant. It is anti-English and anti-London. You may not like Nigel Farage's views but he should be able to go to a pub in Edinburgh and talk about them without this kind of thing happening. It is a very bad advertisement for Scotland."" George Galloway, who was a Labour MP in Glasgow for 18 years, echoed Forsyth's comments. He : ""I hold no candle for Nigel Farage but if leaders of democratic parties with substantial support are to be driven out of Scotland under police protection, it's not going to be much of an advertisement for visitors and investors."" ""The whole event had a very anti-English character, it was very ugly. The language and behaviour of the protesters and the pathetic response of the police, who couldn't even secure a press event held by the third party of the state, doesn't say much for Scotland if it wishes to become independent. This kind of roughhouse is only justified against fascist leaders, and Farage is definitely not a fascist."" Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, the former Labour Scotland minister, said: ""There is an element of anti-English sentiment and there is a fairly nasty side to a few on the periphery of the nationalist movement – not in the mainstream. There is a pretty nasty element [in Scottish nationalism] who are exceptionally rude and vitriolic on social networks. But to be fair to Kevin Pringle [SNP strategic communications director] and Nicola Sturgeon [SNP deputy first minister] they have tried to curb them."" ""If you are not on their [the hardliners'] side then you are unpatriotic. It is: you are with us or you are against Scotland. Maybe Farage has highlighted it to people in London. But Labour people and Conservatives have tried to highlight it in Scotland for some time."" But Foulkes was highly critical of Farage for failing to prepare for his visit to Scotland. ""He didn't help. He came up, went into a pub without getting permission from the publican and held an impromptu press conference. There were students protesting and he dealt with them in a peremptory and unsympathetic manner. He hasn't got a lot of experience in street politics. But he is like a bull in a china shop and has just come into with flat feet and muddied the water."""
2446	2447	After the referendum: the 10 most pressing questions facing the union 	"In his pivotal speech ahead of the referendum, Gordon Brown offered a . Quite what that means is yet to be decided. In his most recent intervention yesterday, Brown spoke of the need to ensure that such policies as the bedroom tax, or indeed the poll tax, could ever occur again in against the people's will. He also spoke of putting the fate of the NHS totally in the Scottish government's hands. All this would involve a huge devolution of powers on welfare, tax and health. The three main leaders have also spoken of ""extensive new powers"". But the devil will be in the detail – which is some way from being spelled out. Labour in Scotland has so far been the most resistant to the devolution of far-reaching tax-raising powers for the Scottish parliament. For example, under the party's previous proposals, they would only allow the Scottish parliament to raise the top rate of income tax from 45p, but not to cut it. All three parties have signed up to a timetable set out by Brown, but that only provides for draft legislation by next January. It would be up to the new government elected in May to then enact the legislation. The fly in the ointment is David Cameron's insistence that the devolution of Scottish powers happens at the same time as reforms to the Commons to ensure that only English MPs can vote on English matters. Michael Gove, the Tory chief whip, has insisted that Scottish devolution could not happen unless hand-in-glove with the parliamentary reforms, raising concerns that the promised timetable for Scottish devolution could be held back as the parties argue over the ""English question"". If the powers that are devolved can be fairly said to equate to a ""modern form of home rule"" and the timetable set out by Brown is abided by, then there can be little cause for complaint. If there is any discrepancy between the promises made before the referendum vote and after the outcome, though, then the SNP and others will be rightfully angry. Such a breach of trust could see a resurgent SNP standing in the Scottish elections in 2016 on a manifesto that promises a second referendum. Such would be the anger of many betrayed no voters it is then likely that the yes campaign would win, and comfortably. Cameron's could be seen as opportunistic or necessary, or both. It could be seen as a party political move in that the change that Cameron is proposing in England (only English MPs voting on English matters) would disadvantage a Labour government seeking to advance any future policies in England. Losing the voting power of their Scottish MPs would make building a majority in the Commons on any English matter more difficult. But if Miliband completely rules out changes to prevent Scottish MPs voting on English matters, it will be seen by many voters as unfair. And if the Tories successfully convince people that reforms in Scotland and England must go ahead, but can't because of Labour, Miliband could end up being portrayed as the man who betrayed Scotland. Answering the calls for English laws to be made by English MPs also benefits Cameron politically in preventing Ukip from taking on the mantle of the party looking after England's interests. The Tories naturally portray their stance as simply a question of principle. Many English people will simply see it as unfair that Scottish politicians are able to dictate policy in England, while English politicians have an ever-diminishing influenec on what goes on in Scotland. Probably not. The leader of the Commons, William Hague, says that much of the thinking on ensuring English laws are made only by English MPs was done last year by Sir William McKay's commission on the fallout of devolution. However, McKay himself has said that he fears that seeing through parliamentary change at the same time as devolution of powers to Scotland is a ""big job"" and it would be advisable for the two processes to have different timetables. Additionally, any legislation offering a radical devolution of powers from Whitehall to assemblies, cities or councils within England would certainly not be achievable by January. There is a simple matter of fairness. Many argue that it cannot be right for Scottish MPs to vote on matters only affecting English constituents when English MPs have no say over affairs north of the border: the so-called West Lothian problem. That is the situation, as it stands. With further devolution it would surely become unsustainable. The downsides of changing the situation are considerable though. A Labour government, its majority sustained by English MPs, could find itself unable to pass legislation with a bearing on England, yet being ultimately responsible for it. The political process could repeatedly arrive at an American-style impasse. The role of Scottish MPs would also be hugely diminished. The Commons would have two classes of MPs. Labour says it understands that this is an issue and it wants to set up a broad consultation on it. The Tories want swift constitutional changes in favour of it. Nick Clegg has said that he agrees with David Cameron, although it is unlikely that his Scottish MPs feel the same. There are voices calling for more devolution to Wales now. Cameron has indicated that he is open to such proposals. He has also said that he wants to be ""fair"" to Northern Ireland, whatever that may mean. This has been floated by but none of the party leaders are backing it. The Tories would have an absolute majority of over 40. That would be small enough for the right wing of the Tory party to have considerable influence over its leadership. Both the Labour party, left with 218 seats, and the Liberal Democrat party on 46 seats, would be diminished forces. Both parties would need to hone their electoral messages to suit voters currently supporting the Conservatives if they were to stand a chance of forming a government in the future. Or find a way to tap the millions who do not bother to vote."
2447	2448	Labour plans radical shift over welfare state payouts 	"A radical shakeup of the welfare state, under which benefit payments to those out of work or on low incomes would vary according to their past contributions to the state, is being considered by the party. As Ed Miliband's party seeks to counter Tory claims that it is soft on welfare, the understands that detailed work is under way in the party's policy review on how to revolutionise the way the system works and address concerns that it promotes a ""something-for-nothing"" culture. One central idea under consideration is the creation of a flexible payments system offering higher benefits to those who have been employed for longer and have therefore made more national insurance contributions. After a week in which Labour has been accused of defending benefit lifestyles such as that of convicted child killer Mick Philpott, party sources said the far-reaching reform would not only introduce greater fairness, but also build stronger incentives to work into the welfare system. ""The problem at the moment is that you have a person aged 50 who has worked all his life and then becomes unemployed getting much the same as the person next door who has never worked. It is about linking what you take out to what you have put in,"" said a senior party source. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, , commits Labour to a return to the ""old principle of contribution"" championed by William Beveridge after the second world war. ""There are lots of people right now who feel they pay an awful lot more in than they ever get back,"" Byrne writes. ""That should change."" In a further move to reward work rather than welfare, Byrne says Labour will allow councils to give priority when allocating housing ""to those who work and contribute to their community"". At the heart of Labour's plan is the reinstatement of full employment as a government objective. Under its plans, no one would be able to remain unemployed for more than two years, reduced to a year for a young person. After that, they would be offered a real job with appropriate training funded by the taxing of bankers' bonuses and restructuring pension tax relief for the wealthiest. If they fail to take the job they would be stripped of benefits. The ideas form part of Labour's alternative to the host of tax and benefits changes announced in George Osborne's controversial 2012 budget, many of which come into force this weekend. On Saturday a cut in the top rate of income tax from 50p in the pound to 45p was introduced benefiting people with incomes of more than £150,000. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, unveiled a poster highlighting what he called a ""tax cut for millionaires"" which would see 13,000 people earning over £1m get an average tax cut of £100,000. Labour said three of the Tory party's biggest donors alone would together receive a tax cut of over £500,000. Balls said: ""The whole country will today see whose side this Conservative-led government is really on and who is paying the price for their total economic failure."" Further changes will mean that the amount pensioners can earn without paying tax will no longer rise with inflation, a move labelled as a ""granny tax"" by critics. The threshold for 40% tax also comes down to to £41,450 from £42,475, adding 400,000 people to that tax band. The shadow chancellor claims that as a result of the changes working families will be up to £4,000 worse off, while millionaires receive average tax cuts of £100,000. Labour also goes back on the attack over benefit cuts, revealing freedom of information responses from 326 local authorities, to which 259 replied, showing that 394,000 disabled people, including 117,000 households claiming severe or enhanced disability benefits, will pay council tax for the first time. This is a result of a 10% cut to council tax benefits given to the vulnerable and the decision to shift decisions on where cuts will fall to local authorities. However, the coalition was keen to stress that the amount people earn before paying income tax has now risen to £9,440, leaving an extra £267 a year in the pockets of millions of basic rate taxpayers. Pensioners also receive a larger rise in the state pension, which goes up by 2.5% to £110 a week. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said he believed the changes would ""make work pay"". ""We think it's important that we make work pay, that we reward people who are working hard on ordinary incomes, and that is what the increase in the personal allowance will do. The wealthy are paying more in every year of this government than they did during the entire period Labour was in office."" Byrne says Labour's approach to welfare will be based on three principles: ""First, people must be better off in work than living on benefits. Second, we would match rights with responsibilities. Third, we must do more to strengthen the old principle of contribution."""
2463	2464	Ukip's Nigel Farage denies 'singing Hitler Youth songs' 	" will insist that Ukip voters are ""mostly in the middle"" of the political spectrum as he seeks to brush off allegations of ""shouting Hitler Youth songs"" as a schoolboy. At the party's conference on Friday, the Ukip leader will challenge David Cameron to reject uncontrolled immigration from Bulgaria and Romania or face the wrath of voters in next year's European elections. But he faces a fresh row before Ukip's annual gathering in London after Channel 4 News obtained a letter written 30 years ago by a teacher at Farage's old school, Dulwich College. The letter to the head of the school, written by Chloe Deakin, expressed concern that Farage had been made a prefect despite reports of ""publicly professed racist and neo-fascist views"". Dated 4 June 1981, the letter says one of Farage's teachers described how the schoolboy and others ""marched through a quiet Sussex village very late at night shouting Hitler Youth songs"" while he was in the cadet force. Farage said any suggestion of singing the songs was ""complete baloney"", but admitted: ""Of course I said some ridiculous things – not necessarily racist things."" He told Channel 4: ""It depends how you define it. You've got to remember that ever since 1968 up until the last couple of years, we've not been able in this country intelligently to discuss immigration, to discuss integration. It's all been a buried subject – and that's happened through academia, it's happened through politics and the media."" The news comes after Ukip has taken action against several members for controversial remarks on social media and a row over MEP Godfrey Bloom referring to foreign aid recipients from ""bongo-bongo land"". In his conference speech, Farage will say the party opposes all racism but defend the right of members to make ""pronouncements that I would not always choose myself"". The Ukip leader will also lay down a challenge to Cameron to reject ""unconditional"" immigration from new EU countries by the start of next year. He will claim a ""Romanian crime wave"" in London shows a ""darker side to the opening of the door in January"". In an appeal to first-time voters, he will say next year's European elections are a chance for people to express their desire to leave the EU ""without worrying which lot will get into Downing Street"". People should treat it like an EU referendum, he will say, making a vote for Ukip a vote for the exit door from Brussels. Farage also is expected to characterise typical Ukip voters as coming from a ""range British society from all parts of the spectrum"" who feel ""fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cutout careerists in Westminster."
2467	2468	From non-doms to Trident: a perilously off-piste week for the Tories 	t is highly unlikely that, at the beginning of this week, Tory strategist Lynton Crosby’s media grid would have read: “Cameron family photoshoot, debate non-doms, get Michael Fallon to say had stabbed his brother in the back and now threatens to do the same to Britain”. For the first time in this election campaign, the have not been able to respond to a question with their preferred answer: “long-term economic plan”. Instead they have been forced to make it personal. Consider this: on every topic debated this week, the Tories were on the wrong side of public opinion. Figures released by Survation on Thursday showed that 59% of the public backed Labour’s policy to abolish the non-domicile tax status. Only 16% are opposed. Even one in two Conservatives are in favour of the plans, with just 20% against. According to a YouGov poll also released on Thursday, a majority (64%) of people think Miliband was right to take on his brother, David, for the leadership of the Labour party. And most crucially, for the first time, . But make no mistake: the election remains close. Polls in the runup to the election will give varying leads to both main parties. In the all-crucial seat calculator, and the Conservatives are still virtually tied when it comes to the race to be the largest party. However, there are three important factors here. First, earlier trends showing that Miliband had closed the ratings gap with Cameron after the leaders’ interviews and debates have consolidated and been confirmed by all polls since. To date, the Tories have relied on the belief that Miliband’s lack of popularity and public doubts over his suitability for the premiership would have proved decisive. This appears to be no longer true, and the attacks aren’t putting a dent in the polling deadlock. Second, the Conservatives are now treading a perilous line. The , and the prime minister has consistently outpolled his party – this is why his personal lead over Miliband was so important, because the Labour leader underperforms compared with his party. In most polls, Cameron still enjoys a lead over Miliband on questions about competency and preferred prime minister. But the fact that the gap is no longer in the 20-point range – at best it is half that – is now mooted by the fact that Labour is more liked. Having the Ukip leader, is not where the party wants to be four weeks out from election day. Tory HQ needs a plan B. In the words of Margaret Thatcher: “If they attack one personally, it means they have not a single political argument”. Third, the current arithmetic is against the Conservatives, instead favouring Labour and the Scottish National party. With both parties projected to win 270-275 seats, the SNP’s 40-50 MPs will be crucial to forming a government - and Nicola Sturgeon has made clear she would back Miliband and vote down a Cameron government. The fact of the matter is that Cameron needs the polls to change a lot more between now and election day than Miliband does. A lot can still happen in the next months – for starters, the parties present their manifestos next week – but public opinion moves slowly and Cameron’s time is running out. The last thing he needed was for his campaign to go off piste for a week.
2472	2473	Ed Balls plays down prospect of Labour deal with SNP 	 has sought to quash speculation that Labour could strike a formal post-election deal with the Scottish National party by hinting that Labour would prefer a minority government to a coalition. The shadow chancellor said a deal with the SNP “is not part of our plan; it’s not what we want” during a pre-election campaign visit to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The idea of forming another coalition government, he added, was now “very unpopular” at Westminster, after the collapse in Liberal Democrat support since Nick Clegg’s power-sharing deal with David Cameron’s in 2010. “The idea of coalition now at Westminster is pretty unpopular and the Lib Dems are really, really unpopular. So there’s no enthusiasm for this kind of discussion with the or the SNP; that’s why we’re fighting to get a majority,” said Balls. “The issue is going to be having a plan or a Tory plan. If you vote SNP and let the Tories in, you will get the Tory plan.” Balls and , the Scottish Labour leader, refused to explicitly rule out a minority Labour government making some form of post-election deal with the SNP and other parties during repeated questioning by reporters in Edinburgh. Murphy said: “We don’t expect a deal or arrangement with the SNP. We’re not expecting the need to do that, because as Ed [Miliband] has said, we are aiming to be the biggest party and win a majority.” Clearly unsettled by the polls putting Labour and the Tories neck and neck, and giving Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP a substantial 20-point lead in Scotland, senior Labour figures from Miliband downwards have . They fear alienating disaffected former Labour voters in who are planning to vote SNP on 7 May and believe privately that they need to allow room to change tack if a deal becomes unavoidable. But Labour is attempting to take a far harder public line on the issue, focusing attention on its case that every lost Labour seat would improve the Tories’ chance of winning in May. Recent polls suggest the SNP could take several dozen Scottish Labour seats, dramatically cutting Labour’s chances of winning an overall majority, but increasing the SNP’s bargaining power in the Commons. Asked to confirm that a minority Labour government would need support from smaller parties such as the SNP or Lib Dems to command a Commons majority, Balls insisted it was a straight fight between Labour and the Tories. “Whether or not we have Labour as the largest party or with a majority will depend centrally on whether or not people vote for Labour MPs, so we’re the largest party at Westminster,” he said. “I can see why Nicola Sturgeon wants that to be the debate in Scotland, but it doesn’t help me because if you want a Labour budget, you have to vote Labour. “If I start answering that question and go down that road in any direction, it makes more complicated a simple truth: if you vote Labour in Scotland, you’ve a good chance of a Labour budget. If you vote SNP, you will make it more likely you will get David Cameron and George Osborne. I would rather talk about simple truths rather than complicated hypotheticals.” Balls brushed aside questions about the attractiveness of Sturgeon’s plans for a £180bn increase in public spending in the next parliament – a proposal the SNP says it would press for in any post-election deal. Insisting he was concerned only with Labour’s blueprint for a 50p top income tax rate, a mansion tax and higher minimum wage, Balls said: “The SNP isn’t a party which has a plan to deliver on the economy at Westminster.” Another key SNP demand, that a further Labour government abandons Trident nuclear weapons in return for an SNP deal, was rejected by Murphy, a defence hawk in Labour’s shadow cabinet. “Issues of national security are far more important than party politics,” he said. This article was amended on 27 February 2015. An earlier version misdescribed Jim Murphy as the shadow Scottish secretary.
2476	2477	Labour and Lib Dems face election bruising in Scotland, poll predicts 	Labour’s general election campaign chairman, Douglas Alexander, and the Liberal Democrats’ economics spokesman, Danny Alexander, are two of the most high-profile projected casualties in Scotland at the general election, according to that was prematurely released on Tuesday night. The long-awaited polling in 16 constituencies in Scotland suggests a 21% swing from Labour to the Scottish National party (SNP). If the results were replicated across on 7 May, Labour would lose 35 of its 41 seats, making the prospect of an overall Labour majority at Westminster much more unlikely, and close to impossible. The polling is the most detailed seat-by-seat assessment of the state of with just three months before the election. In the Labour-held constituencies, the overall swing to the SNP was 25.4%. This ranged from 21% in Airdrie & Shotts to 27% in Dundee West and Motherwell & Wishaw. Ashcroft said he did not expect the swing away from Labour to be that large since his polling has focused on areas with strong support for a yes in the independence referendum in September. Ashcroft is a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party but his research into specific seats around the UK is generally regarded as objective. It suggests that the Scottish Labour party under its new leader, Jim Murphy, has still not yet found a way to stem the nationalist surge since the country voted in the referendum. The research is focused mainly on Labour seats in areas that had a yes or close to yes vote in the independence referendum, and finds only the once rock-solid Labour seat of Glasgow North East as likely to stick with the party. Among the seven Glasgow seats polled, Labour is likely to hold on to only one. “Douglas Alexander, Labour’s campaign manager and the shadow foreign secretary, would lose his Paisley and Renfrewshire South seat with a swing to the SNP of 25%,” Ashcroft writes on his website. He is behind by 48% to 40%. In Gordon, a Liberal Democrat seat held by Malcolm Bruce, who is standing down, the former Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, is due to win the seat by a huge 43% to 26% majority. “Chief secretary Danny Alexander would lose by 29 points since he is currently trailing by 50% to 21%,” the polling says. In the Labour-held seats, only 60% of those who voted for the party in 2010 said they would do so again this year; more than one-third (35%) said they would support the SNP. While the Conservative vote (such as it was) has held up in these seats well, the Lib Dems have collapsed: only 12% of the party’s 2010 supporters said they would vote Lib Dem again; nearly half (47%) said they would switch to the SNP. Pessimism about the economy appears to be driving some of the support for the SNP. Ashcroft writes: “Labour-SNP switchers were markedly less optimistic than most about the economy. Just 41% expected things to go well for the country as a whole over the next year, and 49% for themselves and their families, compared to 59% and 67% of those sticking with Labour.” In a glimmer of hope for Labour, Ashcroft writes some of the SNP leads are not so vast as to be irrecoverable. He writes: “The Labour majorities in some of these seats are such that even a swing of this magnitude has not put the SNP far ahead – for example, just three points in Glasgow South West and Coatbridge, Chryston & Bellshill, and six points in Glasgow North West. “With a vigorous Labour campaign there remains room for movement before May. For such a crucial battleground the campaign in these seats has yet to reach fever pitch – perhaps not surprisingly given the exhausting referendum campaign.” The poll interviewed 16,007 adults by telephone from 5to 30 January 2015. Jim Murphy warned that an SNP victory in the general election in Scotland would only benefit David Cameron and the Tories. Giving his first reaction to the polls commissioned by Ashcroft, he said: ”These polls show that Scottish Labour is well behind and has a big gap to close. “But in the end the only people who will benefit from these polls are David Cameron and the Tories. It is a simple fact that the single biggest party gets to form the next government. “The more seats the SNP gets from Labour, the more likely it is the Tories will be the biggest party and David Cameron will get into government through the back door. “That would be a terrible outcome for Scotland but it’s what might happen if Scotland votes SNP.” After the Ashcroft figures were published, a senior Labour aide acknowledged that Cameron could scrape back into power by splitting the centre-left vote. “There is a stark reality shown by the polls and a simple mathematical conclusion to be drawn,” he said. “What people need to realise that for every one Labour MP lost in Scotland there is a direct increase in the chance of a Tory government. “We do recognise these polls show Labour is behind but the person who is going to benefit from this is David Cameron… We are not going to duck away from the idea there is a strong message in these polls. That strong message is that we have a big gap to close and the only people that will benefit from these sorts of numbers are Cameron and the Tories. “Cameron’s last best hope of staying in government is to split the centre-left vote in Scotland. We are going to make sure people understand that and hear it.” The SNP’s general election campaign director, Angus Robertson, welcomed the “excellent” results, but stressed that the party would be taking nothing for granted in the runup to May’s vote. He said: “People can only make Scotland’s priorities Westminster’s priorities by voting SNP in May. While all the recent polls and our council byelection win in Gordon Brown’s seat indicate the potential SNP vote, they act as a spur to the entire party to work harder than ever before so that we can do better than ever before.” Natalie McGarry, who has been selected by the SNP to stand against Labour’s Scottish secretary, Margaret Curran, in Glasgow East, where Ashcroft predicts a 25.5% swing to the nationalists, said: “The reason so many people in the East End of Glasgow feel disenfranchised is that Labour has taken them for granted for so many years. “If you compare this to the referendum, where you had majorities for yes in places that had large Labour majorities, like Provan or Glasgow South West [another predicted SNP gain], obviously people want something different. Independence is not on the table of course, but people have expressed a desire for change and don’t think that the Labour party represents that change.” McGarry suggests that the poor polling results for Labour in Glasgow reflects the way that the party disengaged from voters in in the city during the referendum campaign. “It had taken a position that they decided was correct without consulting their members or voters. People in Glasgow had maintained their loyalty to Labour over many years, but that covenant to vote Labour and keep the Tories out has been broken. They used it very effectively in 2010, but a Tory government was elected anyway. People are wary now that Labour is a weak party in opposition.” Scotland’s leading polling analyst and professor of politics at the university of Strathclyde, John Curtice, said: “What is striking is how even the movement is. The SNP vote is up by almost exactly the same across the piece, which suggests that the national polls are right. “The nature of the political debate is different on the two sides of the border. I didn’t learn anything about why we are where we are that I didn’t know already. It simply demonstrates to people that, yes indeed, this is happening in every constituency. Hey guys, wake up and smell the coffee.”
2486	2487	New Scotland polls indicate huge swing from Labour to SNP 	It is the most keenly awaited polling exercise I can remember, so what does it tell us? Basically, the same as all other recent Scottish surveys. Does that mean that Lord Ashcroft’s bumper pack of 16 single-seat polls are a bit of a yawn? Not at all, because what all the available evidence has been telling us for months – and what Wednesday’s surveys confirm in spectacular fashion – is that something truly seismic has happened to Scotland’s politics since September’s referendum. A total of 16 surveys of nationwide Scottish voting intentions have been logged at since the referendum vote. Ashcroft’s new polls at a stroke double the volume of Scottish data. They’ve interviewed 16,000 people, and – furthermore – have done so over the phone, which most analysts still think enjoys the edge for accuracy over increasingly common internet surveys. Last but not least, by conducting separate surveys in individual seats, the Conservative peer pulls away the comfort blanket from any or Liberal Democrat MP who was imagined that the extraordinary swing to the SNP, which nationwide polls have been showing, is something that is happening somewhere other than their own back yard. The mainly working-class cities of Glasgow and Dundee voted yes to independence in September, and the perception is very much that it is in such areas that the sharpest swing to the SNP is now being found. In , we drilled down into the data with Prof John Curtice and established that the swing from Labour to the SNP was actually most pronounced in Labour supposed heartland seats. Now Ashcroft has concentrated his examination of the SNP surge in those old socialist citadels that were most inclined to side with independence last year. Just for fun, he thought he’d also commission a couple of costly polls to confirm that Alex Salmond is on his way back to parliament, and Danny Alexander is on his way out, but the real focus of the exercise was very much on the Labour/SNP battleground. And the results could hardly have been more dramatic. The SNP are on course to clean up in 15 of the 16 seats surveyed, often by double-digit margins. Glasgow Central, North, North-West and South-West all go. Only the North-Eastern constituency in the UK’s third-most populous city would remain loyal to Labour, according to these polls. The polls’ reliability is confirmed by their consistency – the average swing in the Labour-held seats was closely bunched around the average of 25%, never more than 27% but never less than a still-pretty spectacular 21%. In a cautious write-up, that the nationwide swing would be expected to be somewhat smaller, since the SNP are probably surging less strongly in places that voted no. That can hardly be relied on to save Labour’s bacon however, since in these places Labour’s majorities are smaller to start off with – so a smaller swing w be enough to wipe them out. The only real glimmer of hope for Ed Miliband and Jim Murphy, leader of the Scottish arm of the party, is that only two-thirds of Labour defectors indicate that their mind is now completely made up – implying one in three could still change their minds. A strong campaign reminding people that a smaller Labour party in parliament will make it easier for David Cameron to remain in No 10 might just pull many of these SNP flirters back to the Labour fold. And that might, perhaps, make the difference between Labour remaining in business in significant parts of its heartlands, and being wiped out. But with just three months until polling day, it is hardly enough for the party to come back and win. It looks very much like Labour’s Scottish election is lost – unless something important changes between now and election day. For the , the data in these polls is less exhaustive – but it is, if anything, bleaker. Scotland is the only part of the UK where the electoral system has not disadvantaged them in recent years – their vote share in 2010 was very much in line with their clutch of 11 Scottish seats. These polls confirm they have been practically eliminated as a Scottish force. In the Labour-held seats, Nick Clegg’s party is running on scores that can be counted on the fingers of one hand – 4, 3, 2 and in several cases 1%. One of the safest Lib Dem seats last time was Danny Alexander’s huge highland turf of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, but Ashcroft’s data suggests that the chief secretary to the Treasury is not merely on course to lose, but to go down by a humiliating margin of 29 points, as the SNP surge to 50% of the vote. One can’t be certain whether his popular, and anti-coalition, political neighbour, Charles Kennedy in Ross, Skye and Lochbar would suffer the same fate. A strong personal vote could just save Kennedy: perhaps Ashcroft will do a separate poll there to check. But in the meantime, aside from Kennedy, this latest data gives credence to the possibility that the Liberal Democrats will be entirely wiped out from mainland , and be consigned to Orkney and Shetland, the one seat they really can’t lose. It would have seemed unimaginable in 2010; but as early as 2011 – in the constituency contests, the Lib Dems could only hold on in these islands. Anyone who still doubts the polls, should remember that Scotland has already given all the Westminster parties the boot at the ballot box once. It now looks poised to do the same thing in elections to Westminster itself. This article has been amended to correct an error. It originally said that ‘a strong personal vote could save Alexander’. The reference should have been to Charles Kennedy
2490	2491	EU exit would make 2m Britons abroad illegal immigrants overnight – Grieve 	Two million UK citizens working abroad could become illegal immigrants overnight if Britain were to leave the , former attorney general Dominic Grieve has warned. In a hard-hitting attack on Eurosceptics inside and outside the Conservative party, Grieve condemned those who want to tear up the UK’s international treaty obligations and withdraw from both the EU and the European Court of Human Rights. His comments come ahead of next month’s launch of the Tory election manifesto, which is expected to commit the party to leaving the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg court – although a long-promised draft bill has yet to be published. There seems to be growing irritation towards how international obligations operate Those close to the policy of quitting the ECHR insist it will be put to the electorate; other Conservative sources suggest Downing Street may be cooling on the proposal at a time when European unity is threatened – not least by Russian activity in Ukraine and on the fringes of Eastern . Conservative party policy is, unequivocally, to promise an in-out referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. Delivering a lecture in central London entitled ‘Britain’s International Obligations – Fetters or Keys?’, Grieve warned departing from the EU would cause more problems than it solves. “The requirements of any free trade agreement would make British removal from the clauses dealing with freedom of movement impossible,” he explained, “with the curious consequence that the single biggest cause of domestic irritation with the EU, immigration, would remain unaltered. But without its maintenance some 2 million UK citizens working in EU countries would find themselves becoming illegal immigrants overnight.” Grieve, who was sacked in the last cabinet reshuffle after vocally opposing Conservative demands to withdraw from the ECHR, has now widened his attack to warn about the dangers of retreat to a policy of “isolationism”. Participation in Nato was in danger of being undermined by Ukip’s campaigns, he added. While acknowledging the shortcomings of Brussels bureaucracy, Grieve, a QC and the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, said: “We may now be in an age where the merit of international obligations and membership of treaty organisations more generally is questioned. The UN charter and organisation itself has long been criticised. “But there seems to be growing irritation towards how international obligations operate. They are seen as fetters on our freedom of action and finances, but doing little to moderate the behaviour of irresponsible states or to assist our wellbeing as a nation.” The dispute over UK membership ”marks a potentially revolutionary turning point in a previously consistent national approach of building, observing and working within international obligations”, he said. “There is ... a total lack of clarity as to how a government would proceed to unravel a relationship that has developed in complexity over more than 40 years. Which parts of the several thousand pieces of EU legislation that are currently incorporated into our own statute law would be retained?” Conservative policy on the European convention on human rights “pays no regard whatsoever to its impact on the other signatory states”, Grieve said. “The success of the convention, despite all its shortcomings, in raising standards of behaviour and promoting human rights globally, and with it the overall security of the Europe, is to be disregarded for the sake of addressing irritations about some of its current domestic impacts which at best will be of utterly marginal benefit. “... In seeking to abandon the EU and the ECHR what message is conveyed as to the value that the UK attaches to international engagement...? To exercise influence globally, it is necessary that we remain a country whose attitudes and commitment others can trust.” The new mood of “rejectionism” and “isolationism” was, the former attorney general said, at odds with Britain’s tradition of building up and respecting obligations and relationships. “We are an outward-facing nation with a global language, a global cultural, educational and legal reach,” he said, “with deep ties all over the world and with one in 10 of our citizens living permanently overseas... We should build on what is on offer and not hanker after some simpler world that does not and has never existed.”
2491	2492	Meet the pollsters who are predicting the general election results 	More numbers will probably be crunched in this year’s UK general election than in all past elections added together. We can count it, all right, but we still can’t call it. The men with the numbers – and they really are almost always men – are at the beating heart of each of the campaigns. Michael Ashcroft exited the Lords, stage right, by , but he has never been more central to Britain’s political processes than he is today, thanks to the entirely unprecedented that he has bankrolled. The high-volume, low-cost potential of online data collection has attracted new polling companies, such as Survation, into the market, and enabled the established ones to churn out their numbers on a nightly basis. But when to try to agree on which way this great tide of information was flowing, six academic teams suggested Labour would be victorious, and another six concluded that the Tories had the edge. Part of the reason for the uncertainty is, of course, that most polls reveal that the election is close. The only way to take a view on whether some companies are more likely to slip up is to gen up on the methods ​they use Another element of the uncertainty, however, is disagreement about which data you ought to trust. Pollsters deal with the standard margin of error of +/- three points, due to random sampling error but also the great unknown, which is how closely, or not, the people who fill in their forms and pick up their phone calls resemble the electorate as a whole. The best-established firms still live in the shadow of 1992, when the near dead-heat confidently predicted by the industry gave way to an eight-point Tory lead. The only way you can take a view on whether another polling disaster is likely, and whether some companies are more likely than others to slip up, is to gen up on the various players and the methods they use to try to make sure it isn’t them. The bullish Australian architect of the Tory election campaign, Lynton Crosby, is a strategist rather than a pollster himself, but his company . Labour hasn’t got the budget for anything comparable – it does surveys across marginal seats as a whole, not individual constituencies. But now that the campaign is under way, James Morris of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner has been spotted heading for Ed Miliband’s suite of rooms at Westminster on a regular basis. And for the Lib Dems, the South African Ryan Coetzee has moved from being Nick Clegg’s special adviser to take the reins at the party’s Cowley Street HQ – where his tasks have included commissioning bespoke Survation polls in the party’s stronger seats, with the . Leaked data from within the campaigns carries an air of intrigue but it should always be consumed with a healthy pinch of salt. Not because there will be anything wrong with the numbers the parties throw their money at, but because ordinarily they won’t be putting the figures in front of your nose – often because they’re outperforming expectations in one particular survey; . So, in forming a judgment on the true political picture, it is much more important to learn to interpret the various published polls. The single most important distinction is between telephone firms such as Ipsos Mori and ICM, and internet firms such as YouGov and Opinium. Also, each polling company applies different weights and adjustments to the data it collects – for example in terms of how past voting behaviour, undecided voters and different levels of certainty to vote are weighted and filtered (for the more nerdy audience, the differences between pollsters are outlined in more detail below). ICM (polls regularly for the Guardian) Ipsos Mori (Evening Standard) YouGov (Sun and Sunday Times) ComRes (online, Independent on Sunday; phone, for Daily Mail) Opinium (Observer) Populus (Financial Times) Survation (Daily Mirror) TNS Lord Ashcroft Most polls will have a sample of about 1,000 people, which is weighted to be representative of Britain’s adult population by demographics such as age, geography and gender (ONS or National Readership Survey data is usually used for this). However, there are important differences between each company’s methods. First, the regular Ipsos Mori, ICM and Lord Ashcroft surveys are telephone polls. While YouGov, Populus, Opinium, Survation and TNS are internet polls. ComRes does both. Phone polls use randomised samples, while internet polls are to some extent self-selecting – respondents have to sign up to a panel but cannot choose the poll they respond to. Historically, phone polls have tended to be more accurate, but there is no evidence to suggest that this will always be the case. On the contrary, the fact that fewer people use a landline will in time prove challenging to phone polling (even if nowadays a proportion of the sample is interviewed by mobile phone), especially as internet polling is cheaper, so more data can be collected, and panels become increasingly representative of a population as they grow in size. Second, to the data it collects – and this is where the main differences between thefirms appear. There are several areas that are common to most of the polling companies: One effect of the different methods used by the pollsters is that each will have varying levels of support for the different parties, resulting, for example, in a particular polling company producing consistently higher Labour scores than other pollsters. These are known as . This doesn’t imply that a poll is partisan, but is simply the result of different approaches. At the end of the day, pollsters want to get it right. Reputations are on the line at every election and how each company applies past behaviour to interpret present-day data is a matter of judgment. Fortunately, the fact that there is an election will allow us to see which method works best. Here’s what happened in 2010: All polls carry a margin of error and levels of confidence. For example, a poll of 1,000 people has a margin of error of about +/- three points and a confidence interval of 95%. In theory, this means 95 times out of 100 the figure in one poll will be within three percentage points of what it would be if you surveyed the entire population. This implies that any change within the margin of error isn’t significant, and that there is always the possibility of a random sampling error. In other words, there is always an element of uncertainty. Because of this, it is always best to look at not just one poll that shows the result we like best, but at .
2492	2493	Boris Johnson: people swearing at police should expect to be arrested 	"Anyone who swears at a police officer must expect to be arrested as part of a zero-tolerance approach in the wake of the London riots over the summer, the London mayor, , has said. In a speech to the Tory party conference that highlighted falling crime rates in the capital, Johnson warned the Conservative-led government that he would not tolerate police numbers falling below safe or reasonable levels on his watch. The mayor – one of the party's most popular figures – was given a standing ovation at either end of his keynote speech as he highlighted his record in office and laid out his plans to avoid further riots. In a swipe at the justice department, Johnson spoke out against guidance instructing police not to arrest people hurling abuse at them. To applause, he told Tory delegates that officers needed backing in dealing with insults in order to set boundaries and ensure people to not go on to commit more serious offenses. Johnson – who has delegated the chairmanship of the Metropolitan Authority to his deputy mayor Kit Malthouse – said that while three-quarters of those arrested in the summer riots had previous convictions, the rest had none. He lauded the work of his new Met police chief, Bernard Hogan-Howe, who was previously chief constable of the Merseyside force and oversaw a 40% reduction in crime during his tenure. Johnson said Hogan-Howe, appointed last month, understood what the mayor called the Capone principle – that ""if you crack down on the small stuff, the big stuff takes care of itself"". ""If people swear at the police, they must expect to be arrested,"" he said. ""Not just because it's wrong to expect officers to endure profanities, but it's also because of the experience of the culprits. ""If people feel there are no comebacks, no boundaries and no retribution for the small stuff, then I'm afraid they will go on to commit worse crimes."" He suggested a new law would need to be established to clear up the confusion over police powers to deal with people swearing at them. Although no specific offence of swearing at a police officer exists, it is an offence under section five of the Public Order Act 1986 to ""use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby"". Johnson's initial response to the riots was widely criticised at the time, with many angered by his delay in returning from a family holiday in Canada. A YouGov poll conducted in mid-August found 54% of respondents saying . However, his subsequent call for the government to rethink police budget cuts was welcomed by the opposition. He told an audience including that he had spent a ""fair bit"" of the past two months speaking to people affected by the riots and had been left with a ""pretty good idea of what Londoners want"". He said: ""They want to make sure nothing like it ever happens again. As long as I am mayor, I will not allow police numbers to fall below a level that I believe is safe or reasonable for a great city like . ""Police numbers are up by 1,000 since I was elected, and the number of special constables has doubled to more than 5,200 – and I pledge to you I am going to keep it that way."" Critics have that the mayor is responsible for police numbers in the capital and that, this year alone, London has seen a 4% drop in police numbers. Johnson said Londoners wanted politicians, teachers, and parents to sort out the underlying issues that caused the riots. On Monday, he announced that he will fund boot camp-style clubs next summer, aimed at instilling discipline and motivating disengaged youth. The ""tough love"" after-school clubs will begin at around 25 schools in the capital. He also used his speech to highlight his Team London project – an umbrella organisation set up for anyone interested in volunteering in the capital – and said his vision was to ""put the village back into the city"". Johnson is seeking re-election in a May rematch with , midway through the coalition's current term. Many Conservatives are privately surprised at how well Tory support is holding up as spending cuts begin to bite, and hope the mood continues as the party heads into the mayoral race. A stall devoted to Johnson was placed just outside the conference hall, with delegates invited to volunteer for his re-election campaign. Cameron said he was right behind his fellow Old Etonian, telling told LBC Radio on Tuesday: ""At a time of economic difficulty, I think he brings strong, charismatic leadership, he brings people together, he cheers people up. ""I am right behind him, because I think the last thing London needs is a return to Red Ken."" Livingstone last week announced plans to cut transport fares in the capital by 5% if he is re-elected, but city hall claims the move would pull crucial investment from London's public transport system. Lauding the government's decision to invest in London's infrastructure, Johnson said: ""Thanks to the common sense of this coalition government, the settlement we got last year, we not only have the Tube upgrades, we have Crossrail and Thameslink. ""I will not allow that investment and these vital improvements to be jeopardised for a short-term political gain."" In a direct address to Cameron, he added: ""I say to my friends in the Treasury – not all of whom I see here; well, Dave's here – Franklin D Roosevelt offered a new deal. I give you the wheel deal: you help us to invest in transport infrastructure, and we in London will supply the locomotive of the UK economy."" Livingstone said Johnson's speech showed the mayor was out of touch. ""Today we saw the real Boris Johnson – an out of touch Conservative, failing to put ordinary Londoners first on the issues that really affect them, from rising fares to police cuts. ""He gave no hope to Londoners facing another steep fare rise this January, which will mean bus fares are up 56% under a Tory mayor, and gave no hard commitment on police numbers, which are in fact due to fall by 1,800 according to his own Metropolitan police figures."""
2495	2496	Kitchen sink drama for Miliband as homely photo backfires 	A harmless picture of and his wife Justine sipping a cuppa at their north London home, in what appears to be a relatively modest looking kitchen, has ended up providing dream tabloid headlines. It turns out that the couple were filmed by the BBC in a second kitchen at their Dartmouth Park home. Labelling him “Two kitchens Miliband”, the that Labour’s plans to portray its leader as an ordinary family man had backfired after he was pictured in his second kitchen. Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks. The auxiliary kitchen, or kitchenette, which has a hob and oven, but apparently no room for a table, was revealed to the world by the Times columnist Jenni Russell, an old friend of the leader – who is godfather to her son. Russell posted her tweet after the Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine . Russell : “Ed Miliband’s kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.” This prompted her fellow Times columnist : “Suddenly struck by the image of Ed Miliband secretly running two kitchen suppers at once, like the booze-up episode of Blackadder.” Vine wrote her column after the Milibands were shown briefly in their kitchen during a earlier this week by its deputy political editor, James Landale. 
2498	2499	'Two-faced' Sun attacked for backing SNP in Scotland and Tories elsewhere 	The Sun newspaper’s decision to back the has prompted accusations that it is little more than an opportunistic anti-Labour strategy. The Scottish edition on Thursday portrayed the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, as Princess Leia from Star Wars, describing her under the headline “Stur Wars” as the “new hope”. It added: “May the 7 be with you: why it’s time to vote SNP.” In contrast, its main London edition pictured David Cameron as a babe in arms, with the declaration: “It’s a Tory.” Urging readers to vote Tory to “keep [the] UK economy on track”, “stop the SNP running the country” and guarantee an election on EU membership, it warned of “SNP wreckers”. The Sun’s main rival in Scotland, the Daily Record, accused the paper of a “two-faced response” on Twitter, adding in another sceptical tweet: “Downmarket tabloid the Sun endorsing the SNP in Scotland, but backing Tories in England to ‘stop SNP running the country’. Nope, us neither.” Two-faced Sun backs Sturgeon in Scotland even while English edition warns of 'SNP wreckers' Downmarket tabloid the Sun endorsing the SNP in Scotland, but backing Tories in England to 'stop SNP running the country.' Nope, us neither Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, Kezia Dugdale, tweeted both front pages side by side, adding: “2 papers, 1 objective.” 2 papers, 1 objective Under its Scottish editor, David Dinsmore, a journalist who fostered very close ties between News UK and then SNP leader Alex Salmond before taking over as UK editor, the Sun’s two editions have consistently taken contradictory stances on the SNP and Sturgeon during the election campaign. The English edition has run often sexist, mocking coverage of Sturgeon, openly backing the Tories’ attacks on a putative deal between Labour and the SNP, and heavily criticising the SNP’s policies. One photomontage of Sturgeon posing as scantily clad pop star Miley Cyrus swinging on a wrecking ball has become notorious among SNP voters under the headline “Tartan Barmy”. In Scotland, however, the Sun has swung heavily behind the SNP and Sturgeon. Andrew Nicoll, political editor of the Scottish Sun, told Scotland 2015 on BBC Scotland that the split was entirely consistent with the fact that both editions were “distinct, editorially-diverse newspapers”. He said: “We are a Scottish newspaper, run in Scotland, printed in Scotland, produced in Scotland by Scots, and it’s not a surprise to anybody – least of all Rupert Murdoch – that these two papers have a diversion of view tonight.” Nicoll denied it was driven by cynicism or a deliberate anti-Labour strategy. “In the time that I’ve worked at the Sun we’ve supported the Labour party, the SNP, the Tories. We’ve fought vigorously against the SNP, we’ve supported the SNP. “Sometimes that support has gone the way the vote has gone, sometimes it hasn’t. The people of Scotland seem to have chosen the SNP, and we’re going with them.” The Scottish edition’s stance reflects a very consistent recent stance in support of the SNP and, until the final week of the referendum, very favourable coverage of Alex Salmond and his pro-independence campaign. It emerged during the Leveson inquiry into hacking that , the News Corp boss, and his executives, after the Scottish Sun had published a hostile, anti-SNP front cover with a noose on it on the eve of the 2007 Holyrood elections. After Salmond’s landslide victory in 2011 – backed by the Sun, Murdoch describing Salmond as “clearly the most brilliant politician in the UK. Gave Cameron the back of his hand this week. Loved by Scots.” Speculation that the Sun could back a yes vote during the independence referendum, driven largely because it was believed Cameron’s Tories had fallen out of favour with Murdoch, only ended after Murdoch visited Scotland in the final week of the campaign. After teasing Cameron on Twitter about the scale of Yes Scotland’s support, Murdoch took fright after deciding the yes campaign was too left of centre and linked to the Green and socialist parties. He took his editors’ advice by taking a neutral stance on the referendum, and tweeted instead that further powers for Scotland within the UK was the better option: “With all-party promises of max devolution, if kept, Britain will be a different place, certainly better managed. Tough negotiations ahead,” he wrote. With all- party promises of max devolution, if kept, Britain will be a different place, certainly better managed. Tough negotiations ahead. Until Gordon Brown’s premiership, the Sun had supported Tony Blair’s new Labour governments – a policy reflected in the Sun’s 2007 anti-SNP headline.
2506	2507	This way to the Brexit: what would happen if Britain left the EU? 	elcome, once again, to the messy and uncertain future of British politics. On the Essex coast, the UK Independence Party has just won its first parliamentary byelection; in Greater Manchester, they have come within a whisker of snatching a hitherto safe seat from Labour. Having once warned the against “banging on” about Europe, David Cameron leads a party that is arguably more obsessed about it than ever. And a new word has entered the political lexicon, which may soon become inescapable. “Brexit” is shorthand for British exit from the – a possibility that is looking more realistic by the day. Ukip, after all, are in the midst of a seemingly endless political summer, while senior Conservative politicians such as Boris Johnson talk optimistically about life outside the clutches of Brussels. Should they win next year’s election, the Tories are pledged to follow a renegotiation of Britain’s membership with an in/out referendum that will supposedly materialise by the end of 2017. Meanwhile, a debate rages between two sides that do not just seem to be from opposed political traditions, but different planets. Mark Leonard, for example, is probably the embodiment of everything Ukip exists to fight. An urbane, multi-lingual product of the mid-1990s milieu surrounding New Labour, he has some claim to inventing the metropolitan notion of “Cool Britannia”. In 2005, he authored an impressive and somewhat optimistic book titled Why Will Run the 21st Century. He’s now a co-founder and director of the European Council on Foreign Relations: as its promotional blurb puts it, “the first pan-European thinktank”. These, surely, are words to make Nigel Farage spit out his pint. Leonard spends much of his time talking to people at the core of the EU, and of late, he has started to pick up rising worry about whether the UK might leave. “It’s gone from something that was a fantasy among some members of the Tory party – John Redwood and people like that – to being a real prospect,” he tells me, with a kind of anxious incredulity. Moreover, plenty of Europeans are beginning to think of the UK as a power that has already turned its back on them. “We’re not actually making many constructive suggestions about the future of Europe,” says Leonard. “So we’re not really much good to anyone else at the moment.” To some people, this is nothing to worry about. Ukip’s deputy leader is Paul Nuttall, the Liverpudlian MEP who represents the north-west of England. He speaks to me from his office in Brussels, and energetically sketches out a vision that now stretches from his party into the heart of British Conservatism: of Britain cut loose from the EU, with no real downsides at all. What gets Nuttall out of bed in the morning is “an issue of sovereignty of democracy” – but, conveniently enough, if Britain were to leave, there would also be no end of economic benefits. As he and his party see it, the UK should get out as quickly as possible, and replace the economic aspects of our EU membership with “a simple free trade deal, either with individual countries or with the European Union as a whole”. This would put us in a comparable position to Switzerland, whose dealings with the EU are framed in a series of bilateral treaties – but with one crucial difference. “We’re not Switzerland,” says Nuttall. “We’re the seventh-largest economy in the world, and we’re Great Britain. And because we run a huge trade deficit with the EU, they’d need us far more than we would need them.” All told, if we left, “we would be a better place to do business”. This, I remind him, is not exactly the view of a lot of businesses. The , for example, thinks that Britain’s membership of the EU is worth up to 5% of GDP, or as much as £78bn a year – roughly the combined worth of the economies of north-east England and Northern Ireland. That’s a lot to lose. “I take everything the CBI says with a pinch of salt,” says Nuttall. “The CBI want us to stay in the European Union, and they’ve made that perfectly clear. I’m more concerned about working-class people who are seeing their wages driven down by immigration.” At the very least, I suggest to him, a British exit would create no end of economic turbulence. After all, when it looked as if Scotland was thinking seriously about leaving the UK, billions of pounds were wiped off the stock market. So imagine what would happen if Britain leaving the EU actually came to pass: an economic catastrophe, some people reckon. Among them is Roland Rudd, the City insider who is the chairman of the communications firm Finsbury (which represents such clients as BSkyB, Marks and Spencer and the mining giant Glencore), and the founder of a pro-EU group called Business for New Europe. He reminds me that such US-owned financial institutions as Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are said to be considering leaving London if Britain quits Europe. Should it happen, he thinks this would only be the start. “Our financial centre would get hollowed out,” he says. “There are around 500 banks that have their headquarters here, and without a passport to operate throughout Europe in the form of the single market, they simply can’t be here. Financial services represents about 10% of GDP; if that was threatened, it would be deeply, deeply damaging.” Nuttall bats this away. The EU, he says “is no friend of the City of London” – indeed, throwing off its shackles might attract more business. On the stock market, he goes on, Brexit may lead to “a bit of fluctuation in the short term,” but nothing more serious. Suzanne Evans is a high-profile Ukip convert who left the Tories well before Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless: she lost her council seat in the London borough of Merton, but now serves as Ukip’s deputy “chairman”, as well as being their parliamentary candidate in her native Shrewsbury. Europe, she tells me, was in her thoughts when she changed parties, but she now truly appreciates “just how awful it is, and how important it is for us to get out”. But what of all those grim predictions about Brexit’s dire economic consequences? “I simply don’t believe them,” she says. “The EU is actually causing economic chaos at the moment.” Evans runs a marketing and PR firm: she talks about the costs implementing European directives, claims that it is big business that defends the EU while small firms suffer, tells me that trading in the EU can be a bureaucratic “nightmare” and ends with a rhetorical question: “How can being able to negotiate our own trade deals again, in our own interests, be worse than the status quo?” There is no precedent for a country of Britain’s size leaving the European project. In the early 1970s Norway completed negotiations to join what was then known as the European Economic Community, before a referendum kyboshed the plan – but that was more comparable to a quick annulment than a messy divorce. (Having once again voted against joining in 1994, Norway remains a member of the European Economic Area, which means that it works under regulations in which it effectively has no say.) Algeria left the forerunner of the EEC when it became independent in 1962; the 56,000 residents of Greenland departed in 1985; the French Caribbean colony of Saint Barthelemy (which, with nearly 10,000 inhabitants, has as roughly the same population as Glastonbury, in Somerset) formally exited the EU in 2012. None of these examples, needless to say, shines much light on what would happen if a country with 65 million people and such a huge economy decided to sling its hook. This much we know: the UK is a net contributor to the EU to the tune of around £12bn a year. But the EU is the our main trading partner, something worth more than £400bn a year to the UK economy. Around 1.8 million British citizens live in other EU countries, a million of them in Spain. The UK shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland – a country which, if we left the EU, would obviously stay within it (more of which in a moment). All told, after 41 years of membership, the EU is tightly woven into just about every aspect of our national life. “Leaving wouldn’t be a straightforward process,” says Leonard. “It could take years and years and years, and cost an enormous amount of money. Think about the tens of thousands of regulations we have that govern every industrial sector, and everything that gets made. Or passports: you’d need new ones, new forms, new border controls … new everything. Tens of billions of pounds would have to be spent, just on managing the transition.” Leonard also talks about Britain being a diminished presence internationally – “Berlin would be the first port of call for any US president – we would be marginal” – before we chew over one of the most practical questions at stake. In terms of popular support, the political drive to leave the EU is largely based on public concerns about immigration. And in that sense, if Brexit happened, the prospect of Northern Ireland sharing an open border with the Republic of Ireland would obviously represent a considerable headache. What with that issue, and the prospect of cross-border smuggling to avoid EU tariffs on some UK exports, something diplomats call a “hard border” would suddenly be on the agenda. “That could destabilise the peace in Northern Ireland,” says Leonard. “When I speak to Irish people, they’re very worried about the Troubles being kind of re-ignited. There are also big economic issues: Ireland is a bigger trading partner for Britain than the Bric countries [Brazil, Russia, India and China] combined.” “If there’s a hard border, there’s a hard border,” says Nuttall. “I personally wouldn’t have a problem if there was one … maybe southern Ireland would see how much we were prospering outside and decide that they no longer wanted to be ruled by Brussels either.” And what of Scotland? Ukip does almost no electoral business north of the border, and before this month’s referendum on independence, polling suggested that the prospect of Britain leaving the EU sharply increased support for Scottish secession from the UK – so how Scotland would react to Brexit is a very interesting question. The Edinburgh minister in charge of the Europe brief is the SNP’s Fiona Hyslop. “I think there’s a real danger for the UK and the Westminster parties if they present a referendum that would lead to exit from the EU,” she tells me. “That’s something that I think would be unacceptable to the people of Scotland and the Scottish government.” She will not be drawn on exactly what she means, but she says this, with a hint of menace: “I have a warning that there will be very serious consequences indeed, and I’m not sure they have been properly thought through.” For all that there is a tradition of left-leaning euroscepticism that goes back to such figures as Tony Benn, the vast majority of our current angst about Europe is traceable to the political right. Indeed, if English Euroscepticism has an elder statesman - and most prominent Eurosceptics are men — it is surely the 74 year-old Conservative MP (Sir) Bill Cash. A veteran of the rebellions against the 1992 Maastricht treaty that put modern Tory hostility to Brussels on the political map, he was battling the EU when Nigel Farage was an unknown twentysomething working for a French bank. Cash now serves as the chair of the House of Commons , and is also well aware of what Ukip are up to: his son, William Jr, is Ukip’s heritage spokesman,  and is reportedly set on standing for Nigel Farage’s party at the next election. “I’m pretty cross, actually,” says Cash. “I’ve disassociated myself from what he’s done, and I’m hoping to have a proper discussion with him.” As against what he sees as Ukip’s “unintelligent” approach, Cash has tended to style himself as a “Eurorealist”, believing – in theory, at least – that the EU could be so could drastically reformed that he and his Eurosceptic allies would be happy staying in. He thinks that the Eurozone’s economic woes mean “the whole thing is beginning to crack”, and sketches out the unlikely-sounding scenario of David Cameron realizing his current approach to renegotiation isn’t ambitious enough, and somehow leading an argument that would lead to a “a whole new architecture in Europe”. All that said, Cash thinks Brexit is nothing to be scared of. Disentangling the UK from Brussels, he tells me, would be relatively straightforward: “I would have thought the process wouldn’t take more than two years.” I suggest that sounds rather optimistic, and mention starting again from scratch with, for example, our passport system. “These things do take time, and they also involve cost,” he concedes. “But the costs are worth it if you’re going to preserve your democratic right to govern yourself, and be a free and prosperous country.” All this, he assures me, is better than being “being inflicted by an unstable and imploding Europe that doesn’t work. And if we exit, other countries will follow us. That’s my judgment.” Again, the prospect of stock market meltdown is swatted away: “I don’t think that follows at all … if you’re coming forward with a positive proposal to trade across Europe and the world, a lot of the stock markets would say, hooray.” Then why do US-owned banks threaten to leave? “Well, that’s a very interesting question to which there’s no obvious answer … since 1945, there has been a continuous stream or argument coming from the US in favour of a United States of Europe. All I’d say to that is: I’m sorry, you’re wrong.” If Britain leaves the EU, Cash says, it will mark something as historic as the abolition of slavery, the repeal of the corn laws (which, with echoes of what may happen again, split the Tory party), the franchise-extending Reform Act of 1867, and the convulsive events of the 1930s. Not for the first time, I’m reminded of the drastically different ways that each side of the argument thinks about what’s at stake. One camp worries about jobs, border posts and passports; the other talks passionately about national sovereignty, and hears the call of history. Europhobes are from Mars; Europhiles are from Venus. And as the great political war about Europe grinds on, any kind of truce seems more unlikely than ever.

As Tory MPs showed their support for the former education secretary by giving him a warm welcome at meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee, Vine tweeted a link to the article which described her husband as a more remarkable reformer than Margaret Thatcher. ""A shabby day's work which Cameron will live to regret,"" Vine tweeted as she linked to the article under the same headline by the former editor and historian Max Hastings. A shabby day's work which Cameron will live to regret via The intervention by Vine, a Daily Mail columnist who also tweeted a link to a Times cartoon suggesting the prime minister would be grateful if her husband smothered himself, came as the . Downing Street came under fire in the House of Lords after the position of leader of the Lords was downgraded from a full cabinet post. Lady Stowell of Beeston, who , Lord Hill of Oare-ford, will attend cabinet, but will not be a full member. Downing Street was forced to announce that Hill will sell his shares in his former lobbying company after a backlash in the European parliament against his nomination. The prime minister also faced criticism over the revelation that three of the sacked ministers will receive knighthoods. Alan Duncan, the former international development minister, and Hugh Robertson, the former Foreign Office minister, will receive KCMG knighthoods in the diplomatic list known as ""Kindly Call Me God"". Oliver Heald, the former solicitor general, will receive the more modest domestic KBE. The prime minister defended his decision to revive the tradition of political knighthoods. He told MPs: ""I make no apology for saying that I think in public life we should recognise public service – people who have worked hard, people who have contributed to our nation and to our government. I think that is a good thing to do."" But there was an ominous sign at prime minister's questions of agitation on the right when the sacked Eurosceptic environment secretary Owen Paterson made a point of standing in a hostile manner next to the former defence secretary Liam Fox by the bar of the House of Commons. Friends of Fox say he was humiliated by the prime minister when he was offered the third post in the Foreign Office. Tory MPs showed their irritation with the reshuffle when they gave a warm welcome to Gove as he took the place reserved for the chief whip at Wednesday's meeting of the 1922 Committee, which was addressed by Theresa May. It was Gove's recent confrontation with May over how to tackle extremism that helped persuade Cameron to demote his close friend. The Gove camp were so angered by overnight reports in the Guardian, Daily Mail and Times that Tory campaign director Lynton Crosby had warned No 10 that he was toxic in polls, that Vine endorsed a Daily Mail article which said the reshuffle amounted to a ""small earthquake in Whitehall"". In the article, Hastings wrote: ""The sacking of – for assuredly, his demotion from education secretary to chief whip amounts to nothing less – has shocked middle England. Here was the undisputed Tory hero of the past four years – a man with a mission, a crusader, an obsessive, who has shown the courage to hurl himself into the task of salvaging Britain's ruined schools system in a fashion no other holder of his office in modern times has attempted."" The criticism over the downgrading of the leader of the Lords was led by Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, a former Scotland secretary, who is a respected figure on the right. Forsyth told peers: ""It is vital that the leader of the house has the authority of a cabinet minister, especially given the large volume of legislation that comes from the other place undebated and unconsidered. She needs the authority to be able to say to other cabinet ministers: 'This will not wash', and to say to the prime minister: 'I think you need to think again'."""
2525	2526	Devastating impact of cuts on disabled people 	The general election is upon us. In 21st century Britain we like to think we live in an equal and fair society, but equality is hard won. There was a time when women chained themselves to railings for their right to vote, a time when gay people were imprisoned and when signs proclaimed “No blacks, no dogs, no Irish”. All have had to fight for their right to equality. Disabled people are fighting too, but not simply for equality – for their very survival. Perhaps they think disabled people are an easy target, because the 'scroungers' rhetoric has skewed public perception A third of disabled adults already live in poverty. Disabled people and those needing social care have already been than others. Under the Conservative-led coalition every aspect of their support has been reduced, abolished or failed, costing the taxpayer and costing lives. But just weeks before the election we discover through a that the Tories plan £12bn more cuts to social security, including disability benefits ( , 30 March). The UN is said to be conducting a in the UK. If these cuts went ahead it would be a further breach of , which the UK ratified in 2009, with cross-party support. Every week we learn of more , many others will follow if more support is stripped away. The . Yet , , , and have all doggedly refused to give any details before the election. Iain Duncan Smith has said: “We may, we may not, decide that it’s relevant to put something out there about some of those changes.” It is unfair and irresponsible to conceal changes that may heavily impact the lives of those who have already been hit the hardest. Perhaps they think disabled people are an easy target, because and the rhetoric of “scroungers” and “skivers” has skewed public perception of people who need support. But more and more, people are becoming aware of how unfairly disabled people have been treated. The tide is turning. which would increase their already profound social and economic disadvantage and asked the public to show their support. We, like those before us, are prepared to fight until disabled people are treated equally and difference doesn’t matter anymore. , Founder Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation , Criminal defence solicitor, , , , Forgive my incredulity, but refuses to be specific about £12bn of proposed cuts to welfare such as would transform the social fabric of the UK, and this appears to be far less important an issue than the role of the SNP, a perfectly legitimate British political party, in any future government. Is Labour not letting us all down by not hounding Osborne, demanding details, making it plain that if the turkeys do vote for this Christmas, it will be the type that even Scrooge would disown? (30 April) is right in drawing attention to the danger of all the political parties shutting their eyes to the realities of the SNP. What he does not say is that if the Conservatives, with or without Lib Dems, form the next government, the breakup of the union is a certainty since the major further cuts to welfare will be totally unacceptable in Scotland. With 50-plus MPs, the push for an independent Scotland will be unstoppable. The consequences for the UK will be political chaos followed by financial chaos, especially as the EU referendum will be in the mix. The Tories and continually use the term “working people” during the election campaign. The subtext is clear. This term is calculated to target the “employed” middle ground. What about those who do not fit this select definition? For instance, unemployed people, disabled people, sick people, asylum seekers and carers. The truth is that their subtle omission from this rhetoric merely reveals that the main political parties have abandoned all solidarity with these groups. In fact, both the previous and current governments have presided over the most draconian cutbacks to benefits and services that directly affect these groups. We do not need more scapegoating or divisiveness. We need a language and a progressive politics that embraces and involves the most vulnerable and powerless in our society. Larry Elliott overlooks the most direct solution to the housing crisis ( , 27 April): phase out housing benefit. It is estimated that housing benefit will reach £25bn a year during the next parliament. This amounts to a vast subsidy for employers who do not pay a living wage; for banks who can lend recklessly knowing that the government will always (one way or another) pick up the tab; and for buy-to-let landlords, who also benefit from tax relief on their already low interest repayments. Any other “industry” subsidised to this level would quickly be dismissed as a lame-duck enterprise. The savings over one parliament – more than £100bn – would easily pay to build the social housing the UK so desperately needs. If the withdrawal were phased (probably by region and starting with London), any recalibration of the housing market would be sufficiently gradual to avoid a crash. This radical move will tackle the underlying cause rather than the inevitable symptoms of our building crisis.
2529	2530	Cameron's nominee for EU executive branded 'radical anti-European' 	"David Cameron's for the new EU executive ran into trouble on Wednesday within 24 hours of being named when he was accused of being a ""radical anti-European"" who would struggle to pass muster in European parliament hearings in September. Cameron's surprise choice for the plum Brussels post, Lord Jonathan Hill of Oareford, meant the prime minister followed Gordon Brown in naming a leader of the for the European commission. Five years ago Brown sent Catherine Ashton, the outgoing EU foreign policy chief and a former Lords leader, to Brussels. Downing Street's choice ran into immediate opposition from the European parliament president, Martin Schulz. In recent months, Schulz has been making the political weather in Brussels. It was largely his politicking that outwitted EU national leaders, not least Cameron, and propelled Jean-Claude Juncker to the top of the European commission. Juncker, vehemently opposed by Cameron, was in the post in Strasbourg on Tuesday with 422 votes in the 751-seat chamber. Schulz called it a ""historic day"". On Wednesday, he said: ""I cannot imagine Hill, whose views – in as far as he's got any – are radically anti-European, getting a majority in the European parliament."" Hill, who has previously worked for the ardently pro-EU Kenneth Clarke and also for John Major at Maastricht more than 20 years ago, is not particularly known for being Eurosceptic. Later Schulz backtracked from his attack on Hill . ""I have now been informed that he was head of private office under John Major and that he has been able to build consensus within the house of lords,"" Schulz told a Brussels press conference. ""Friends have also informed me today that Mr Hill is in fact more pro-european than anything else in the UK context, and I'm glad to hear that."" Cameron hopes to secure a major economics portfolio in the new Juncker commission. The word in Brussels for the past 10 days has been that to succeed, the prime minister would need to nominate a ""big beast"". Hill does not pass that test, lacking any profile in national or European politics. When the relatively unknown Ashton was named by Brown five years ago, the reaction in France was ""Lady Qui?"" The nomination of Hill has met with similar bemusement particularly since many countries are putting up senior national political figures of cabinet rank for the Juncker team. In Westminster and Whitehall, however, Hill is reputed to be a skilled fixer and networker. British officials say his primary function in Brussels will be to build alliances, strike deals and reach consensus with his EU peers with a view to assembling support for some of the reforms Cameron hopes to achieve if he is to fight and win a referendum in 2017 keeping Britain in the EU on new terms. Hill was one of the most influential lobbyists in Britain after founding , which was then bought out by public relations firm Huntsworth in 2006. He remained a director of Quiller until his appointment as a junior minister in 2010 and he has kept a substantial shareholding in Huntsworth, according to his list of interests. Quiller – whose clients in the last quarter included HSBC, the United Arab Emirates and private healthcare investor Circle Holdings – still has strong links with the government. It now employs Sean Worth, a former special adviser to the prime minister until last year and ex-head of the Conservative policy unit, and Ruwan Kodikara, who worked for Nick Clegg's leadership campaign team. Their lobbyists have recently had meetings with the head of the Downing Street policy unit, Jo Johnson, and the prime minister's deputy chief of staff, Kate Fall. Asked about his shareholding, a UK government official said: ""He was nominated yesterday. He has considered that and he has decided he will sell those shares...He has made the decision. The process is under way."" After the bruising confrontation over Juncker, which Cameron lost overwhelmingly a fortnight ago when 26 EU national leaders supported the Luxembourg ex-prime minister, leaving Cameron only with Hungary on his side, the talk in Downing Street and Brussels is of mending fences and damage limitation. Cameron is to have breakfast on Thursday morning with Juncker to discuss Lord Hill's post in the new commission from November, with the prime minister pressing for a major economics portfolio. It will be the first meeting between the two men since Cameron argued vehemently against Juncker's appointment at an EU summit a fortnight ago and was outvoted. The two men are also to discuss Juncker's policy blueprint for the next five years and ""the reform of the UK's relationship with the EU"", said a Downing Street official. But the European parliament is flexing its muscles after triumphing over national leaders in deciding how Brussels works. It is unlikely to do Hill any favours in September. The parliament cannot reject individual commissioners, only the Juncker commission en masse. But it can force Juncker to drop and replace commissioners-designate. ""It remains to be seen whether Mr Hill will be unprejudiced toward us,"" Schulz told a German radio station. ""Whether he gets a majority depends on that."" , the MEP and leader of Ukip, which won the election in Britain in May, denounced his parliament president as anti-democratic. He said: ""This is a declaration of war by Schulz on the choice of the British government. How dare Martin Schulz interfere in the British nomination of European commissioner and prejudge what the decision of the MEPs will be. He is supposed to be an independent chairman, but he has demonstrated absolutely no respect for national democracy or national government."" Hill's lack of prominent political status contrasts with nominees from many other EU countries who are fielding former prime, foreign, or finance ministers for plum jobs, apparently reducing Britain's chances of taking one of the main portfolios. Cameron wants a key economics post, meaning ideally but improbably being put in charge of the EU's single market. Alternatives would be energy or trade. Ashton, Peter Mandelson, and Leon Brittan also served as trade commissioners. The trade portfolio would put Britain in charge of negotiating the EU's sensitive trade pact with the US, one of the biggest political topics on the current EU agenda. But the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a risky undertaking. A successful negotiation under UK stewardship would allow Cameron to sell a major achievement in his planned referendum campaign in 2017. Many, however, expect the trade talks to fail, meaning a UK-led negotiation could turn into a fiasco."
2536	2537	Gordon Brown’s experience will be missed when he quits as MP 	e can’t blame . He’s done his national service and reached the top of the greasy pole of politics. He will be 64 and has taken quite a beating, not least from himself, I suspect, since his premiership crumbled under immense pressure in 2010. But we can and should regret his departure from the Commons. Thirty-one years an MP – he was first elected in Margaret Thatcher’s “Falklands landslide” victory of 1983 – he has vast experience, which should be on tap to guide and warn his successors. Nowadays far too many people get their hands on the steering wheel of state while still wearing their political L-plates. It shows. What does the record tell us about his decision? It’s in keeping with recent practice, but not with the habits of generations past. fled the scene after 10 years at No 10, resigning as an MP to make money. His career as an elder statesman, international do-gooder and charity sponsor has been sullied by the money. is leaving too, at 54. A more serious parliamentarian, he may be the greater loss as neither Blair nor Brown took the Commons seriously, certainly not as much as Thatcher, though she fled too. It didn’t use to be like this. One hundred years ago, the overly detached Tory who succeeded his uncle as prime minister (1902-5), was still an MP, yet to become foreign secretary (1916-19) in the war-winning Lloyd George coalition and was still in cabinet until 1929 – a year before his death at 81. The 1917 in favour of a Jewish national homeland is his, so he is not forgotten either. I know it is all a long time ago, but well within living memory did the same. Having used Tony Benn’s rejection of the peerage legislation – the law of unintended consequences dogged Benn’s career – to become prime minister in the Profumo storm of 1963, the 14th Earl of Home became a life peer (Lord Home) after his defeat by Labour’s Harold Wilson in 1964 and served as Ted Heath’s foreign secretary from 1970-74. Having been Neville Chamberlain’s bagman at Munich, he was tough on the Russians to make up for early errors of appeasement. The ousted Chamberlain died in cabinet office six months after being replaced by Winston Churchill, who made sure he took the leadership of the Tory party after the funeral – to avoid fate, the Tory coup of 1922. Lloyd George hung on as an MP: brilliant, mischievous, proto-Keynesian and creative until almost the end. In 1940 he half-expected to do as Marshal Pétain had done in defeated France: negotiate what terms he could with Hitler. Instead he lost to in 1945. Attlee only quit as Labour leader and MP in 1955 – a “temp” who lasted 20 years – and took the usual peerage in the same year Churchill was finally eased out of No 10 – at 80. He stayed an MP, rarely speaking, until 1964 and was grand enough – shrewd too – to reject the proffered dukedom. He knew that game was over. So was his own. He died within six months. Each case is different. After his prostate scare – the last former prime minister I never met – quit as PM and MP in 1964, declined the earldom and lived until 1986, occasionally mocking Thatcher for “selling the family silver”, but being otherwise statesmanlike and supportive. For reasons never fully explained (for his son, Maurice, who then predeceased him?), he belatedly took the peerage in 1984, when he was 90 and not saying much. It was the moderniser who broke that habit by continuing Labour’s policy of not awarding hereditary peerages. As every Guardian reader knows, he was overthrown by Thatcher in 1975 but stayed as an MP until 2001 – and her policies. This was politically understandable – Heath believed he was right about most things – but deplorably bad personal behaviour, so Thatcher did the same to when her turn came after leaving the Commons for the Lords in 1992. She died only last year, a guest of the Barclay brothers in the Ritz hotel, a sad end. In fact Major is the only recent former prime minister whose behaviour has largely been impeccable. Defeated by Blair in 1997, he remained an MP until 2001 and did not take a peerage – like Heath but unlike (1976-79) and (1964-70 and 1974-76). I can remember both speaking from the backbenches as ex-PMs, not often but usually wisely, likewise as peers. I last saw the frail Wilson being shepherded through the Lords by Callaghan, older but tougher. Callaghan had stayed on as leader until 1980 in an attempt to deliver the job to . When won and led Labour to a – Callaghan made an unhelpful election contribution on defence. But mostly he was supportive. I used to ring him up occasionally to sound him out. Blair puzzled him. He was always worth listening to, . The conclusion we should draw – says me – is that no two cases are similar. Gordon Brown has been barely seen or heard in the 2010 parliament, speaking mostly on local constituency issues. I regret that, he has much to tell us all and much of it is wise. Who kept us out of the euro, for example? . Who rescued the wicked bankers he had rashly trusted? Same again. Who belatedly spoke out with such effect to help ensure a No vote in Scotland’s referendum? Well yes, Gordon again, though he had sulked through most of the campaign. It’s in his nature. But too many politicians today get top jobs too soon and quit politics too soon, too, just when they are getting the hang of it in some cases. The example I admire is that old throwback, Ken Clarke. I asked if he plans to step down in May. After all he’ll be almost 75. Not a bit of it – he plans to go on speaking his backbench mind and making trouble.
2537	2538	What Britain in the EU means to us: five leading European writers on the threat of Brexit 	avid Cameron’s plan for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the leaves the UK’s EU status more precarious that at any point for 40 years. But what do continental powers feel about the possibility of Brexit – a British EU exit? Five prominent writers from leading European newspapers in France, , Italy, Spain and Poland reflect the view from their country. The German government is by now well used to the fact that the big questions of will, sooner or later, end up in Angela Merkel’s in-tray. Euro crisis, Grexit, Russia-Ukraine … Germany attracts these problems like a magnet. That’s what you get when you’re the first among equals. Not that the German authorities are always happy about it. So it is that even on the subject of the British referendum, all eyes are once again turning to Germany. Britain and the other EU members are waiting for a signal: how ready is Berlin to meet David Cameron halfway? In these crunch moments, Merkel likes to do what she does best: she waits it out. It’s not as if the Brexit alarm came out of the blue after Cameron’s re-election. Over the past two years, no meeting between Merkel and the British prime minister went by without the pair discussing EU reform – and German resistance to it. Merkel wants to keep Britain in the EU. She has made no secret of this. She belongs to the German group of politicians that tend towards anglophilia, not francophilia. She respects the British political system, admires the system of parliamentary debate and values the calmness with which the democratic system has always operated. Anyone wanting to understand her sympathy for Britain need only read the speech she made in February last year to both houses of parliament . For Merkel it is essentially a question of the political heft and power of the EU, which would be hugely damaged if not destroyed if such a significant power as Britain were to withdraw. Her political message to Cameron is: pull out, and your country will find its position in the world reduced. But below the surface, she is equally worried about the balance in Europe where Britain is often seen as a German ally in matters that pit the north against the south. Merkel cannot understand how through the last UK parliament Cameron let himself be pushed into ever deeper commitments on Europe by the anti-EU factions in his party, only to find that his opponents would raise the bar still further. She admires Cameron as a speaker – but certainly not as a tactician. That could all change if the prime minister sticks to the rules of the game which have been negotiated by Berlin and London over the past six months. The most important of which is: keep your mouth shut while you’re preparing reform, so as not to give your critics any ammunition. The bottom line in all this is that the Germany government assumes that the British prime minister also really wants to keep Britain in the EU. And so the question arises: what is the price that Cameron believes he must ask? Berlin has already made perfectly clear that any changes to European treaties would be too risky. The crushing rejection of the constitution in referenda in and the Netherlands taught Germany’s political class that the delicate theme of Europe should never simply be put to a yes-no vote. On the other hand, ever since the euro crisis, Merkel’s principal goal is to immunise Europe’s economic union against further currency shocks. To do that, treaties will probably have to be changed. And yet: there is as yet no real appetite for a big reform project in Europe, and in the middle of the Greek crisis it is more than improbable that the other European nations are suddenly going to want to take on the next big European project. And so Merkel will try to reduce the British aims to digestible chunks which she can then make appear palatable to the rest of Europe. It’s clear she lends a sympathetic ear to many reformist ideas; in London last year she said: “We must constantly renew Europe’s political shape so that it keeps up with the times.” Beyond the platitudes, Merkel is open to reforms to the internal market, to competitiveness, to the bureaucracy and even to some of the institutions. Cameron’s central theme – freedom of movement, and above all economic migration within the EU – will be the biggest problem. But even here, Merkel and Cameron have made some provisions. Cameron’s big freedom of movement speech last year was closely agreed with Berlin and was then promptly praised by Merkel. Both are firmly agreed that there should be no incentives for economic migrants, such as out-of-work benefits. But Merkel will not agree to quotas or special rules for Britain on this. Merkel will now repeat two messages in the coming months, which she has borrowed from a 30-year-old speech by the late former president Richard von Weizsäcker: Britain belongs to Europe, because without Britain we would not have a democratic Europe. And Europe will only evolve by degrees, not in leaps and bounds. Merkel gets spooked by the radical – and that’s why this referendum idea is an abomination. She would never stake all her political capital on one small question. The last time London broke away from Europe it was because of a fight with Rome. Henry VIII wanted to marry Anne Boleyn so broke off relations with the Pope, who opposed it. Just like today, many advisers of the king were worried, but for England in the 16th century, it was a happy choice: it discovered that there were more dynamic countries with which it could do business, and lay the foundation of its empire. Relations with Rome are now decidedly better. As British ambassador Christopher Prentice said, in very British way: “It’s not just bread and butter, but also jam.” Until just a few years ago, an Italian in London was invariably greeted by giggles and jokes about “bunga-bunga”, but since Mario Monti has been in government, we’ve been considered rather more serious and reliable by Downing Street and in the City (thus creating the widespread impression that things can even get better if Italians do not actually vote for who governs them). Business relations are optimal and dozens of Italian companies, from Finmeccanica to Eni, from Merloni to Calzedonia, from Pirelli to Ferrero, are well established in Britain. The British want from us what they believe we do well: clothing, food, sports cars, furniture, domestic appliances, and beer (yes, even that), and collaboration with in the fields of energy, defence and aerospace research. We import drugs, cars, hi-tech, whisky, financial services and technology for renewable energy from them. If Britain leaves Europe, all of the rules that made this possible and mutually convenient would have to be revisited – and what happens then would depend on new rules, and especially new tariffs. London won’t be the destination of choice anymore for young people with two degrees The separation would not be painless. There are maybe 200,000 Italians living in Britain, about half of them in London. If, as expected, Brexit causes the loss of many jobs (the optimists predict one million, the pessimists three), tens of thousands of Italians will return home. Those who remain will have to apply for a residence permit and work permit, and the same will have to be done by 20,000 British people living in Italy. London won’t be the destination of choice anymore for young people with two degrees who are looking for a job at Caffè Nero to pay for a master’s degree: they will face queues at passport control and have to undergo a bureaucratic rigmarole similar to the one that exists in the United States. The link between Italy and Great Britain will not die easily. The bread and butter is business, but the jam is made of a true mutual love, which began centuries ago with the Roman travels of Browning and Shelley, and Byron and Keats, who were staying in hotels that were called de Londres and de l’Angleterre, Brighton and Victoria. It was their ecstatic stories that convinced everyone that you could not become a true gentleman without having visited Rome. The British are now more in love with Italy than the Italians are: they appreciate the food, the language, the tastes, the gestures of the people, the Tuscan landscape, the climate that renders indolence a little bit inevitable. It’s a love that is reciprocated: the Italians adore London, they colonised South Kensington and Chelsea when Russian oligarchs were still putting aside their first roubles; they have learned English manners; they look to Prince Charles to understand male elegance; and they are grateful to have got their slice of the Beatles, David Beckham, James Bond and royal gossip. Even if politics divide them, Italy and Great Britain will never leave one another. François Hollande wasted no time in congratulating David Cameron on his re-election this month, inviting him to a prompt tête-à-tête in Paris – but a British referendum on leaving Europe raises a number of reservations in France. Only a few isolated voices – such as former cabinet ministers Laurent Wauquiez and Michel Rocard – argue in favour of a Brexit, the latter considering that Britain is principally to blame for the paralysis in European decision-making. Officially, French leaders intone how they want to see London stay in the European club, but not at the expense of giving away lots of concessions to help Cameron. They insist there can be no question of opening up European treaties for reform, as Cameron demands, nor of any fundamental change to EU migration rules – Ukip’s main hobby horse. “The functioning of the European Union can be improved, but we cannot go back on its founding principles,” France’s secretary of state for European affairs , Harlem Désir, warned shortly after Cameron’s re-election. “One country alone cannot call into question the desire of the others to continue to advance together.” Seen from Paris, the debates on Britain’s EU membership, and certainly a British exit following Cameron’s promised referendum, risk having a knock-on effect on French public opinion: a Brexit, if it actually happened, could hardly fail to encourage France’s sovereigntists or the far right. Marine Le Pen is already demanding that France leave the euro, or that the Schengen free circulation area be suspended. This preoccupation is all stronger because Cameron initially promised to hold his referendum in 2017, a difficult time for the French government because of presidential and parliamentary elections that year. The prime minister’s entourage is now mulling a vote before the end of 2016. “It would be better if this uncertainty did not go on too long,” a senior French official commented, “but whatever happens that would not leave time to start a process of treaty reform.” In the meantime, what French officials fear most is an alliance between Cameron and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who is intent on keeping Britain on board the European boat. The chancellor has often, along with her finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, flirted with the idea of European treaty reform to consolidate monetary union – something the British rarely fail to mention when they demand (despite having refused to join the euro) such a debate, with a view to obtaining new exemptions from EU standards. Facing what they consider contradictory pressures on two fronts, the French government plays them off against each other: the repatriation of powers from Brussels to national governments (as sought by Cameron) and increased integration – particularly budgetary integration of which the Germans dream in order to consolidate the eurozone – are, for France, “incompatible”. It would be better all round, Paris reckons, not to disturb Europe’s present fragile equilibrium by opening Pandora’s box. A new reform of the European treaties would be highly likely to fuel an intense public debate in France, perhaps even to be rejected if it were also put to a referendum. Ten years after France’s “non” to the European constitution, on 29 May 2005, François Hollande, who was then leader of the French Socialist party, still harbours memories of the stinging defeat of the “oui” for which he had campaigned against the advice of a sizeable chunk of his party. An unpleasant experience of which he will doubtless remind Cameron in the months to come. It’s difficult to think of two countries whose paths into the EU could have been as different as those of and the United Kingdom. In Spain’s case, our adherence to what was then the European Community was the culmination of a yearning by successive generations cut off from the possibility of joining the broader current of peace, democracy and progress that was flowing north of the Pyrenean border. Hence the intense, proud and enthusiastic process of Europeanisation on which Spanish society, its politicians, businesses, intellectuals and unions embarked, first in 1978 with the adoption of the constitution, and then from 1986 with the formalisation of European accession. In the UK, on the other hand, finally joining the EU was not a historic achievement around which to build a story of national pride but a double defeat: firstly, that of an empire saying goodbye to its territories overseas, and secondly, a failure to organise European affairs around a rival model launched by the Treaty of Rome in association with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). All of which explains how, from countries such as Spain, it’s not easy to understand why the desire to be members of the EU – something which to us is so simple and intuitive, even despite the recent crisis and the implementation of tough austerity policies and agreements – can cause so many complications for the British. This incomprehension does not necessarily mean that Spain would represent an obstacle for David Cameron as he negotiates a better agreement with the EU. Unlike in other European capitals, where one can perceive a degree of animosity and frustration with Cameron’s tricks and tactics, Spain has no special interest in making things hard for the British prime minister. That’s not to say, however, that he will have it easy. In Madrid, as in other capitals, there will be a certain flexibility to negotiate the exceptions that may eventually accommodate the UK. The British are specialists at this and the rest are already used to it, so technically there is no reason why it should be difficult to come to an agreement. Spain, however, is not simply going to accept Britain’s desire to force all of its partners to negotiate a treaty which requires parliamentary ratification or referendums across the member states. That would open a public opinion can of worms which, over the past decade, has taken so much to close. Spain also has no sympathy with the idea of distorting the fundamental principles, such as free movement of people, until they become unrecognisable, purely so as to give ammunition to Cameron again the xenophobic Ukip. So in the coming months, Cameron will try to convince his European partners that the British are willing to leave if their demands are not met. Meanwhile, they will try to convince him that they can’t give him what he’s asking for. The question is, who will British voters believe in when the moment of truth arrives? Cameron, who will say that he has won a historic agreement, or the European leaders, who will say that they haven’t given him anything important? Have the British gone mad? ­That was the Polish reaction to the news that David Cameron intended to call a referendum on his country’s future membership of the European Union. To Polish ears, the notion sounded like blasphemy. Poles are the biggest enthusiasts in Europe. And among the new members, they are the champions at spending money from structural funds. We spend every cent the EU gives. And thanks to that, in the course of 10 years of membership, our country has changed out of all recognition. We have motorways, fast trains, airports, schools, libraries and swimming pools. (Still, at the beginning of the 21st century, a leading European economic magazine doggedly insisted on illustrating a piece about with a peasant riding on a cart. Today, carts are to be seen in museums.) Polish farmers, who before accession were tearing their shirts and warning that the evil Germans and French would buy up Polish land for nothing, are emerging as the biggest beneficiaries of the EU. Of course, they still complain about their fate, but at home they have plasma televisions, and they drive out on their fields on tractors worth tens of thousands of euros. Brexit fans in the British Isles will find few allies on the Polish political scene How, then, can you quibble with such a union? It would be biting the hand that feeds you so generously. Brexit fans in the British Isles will find few allies on the Polish political scene. In the Polish debate, the issue of the Brussels diktat or loss of sovereignty has surfaced only very rarely of late. Britain’s dilemma over whether to stay in the EU is not a subject that newspapers write about every day in Poland. But we fear some evil spirit might take hold of the British, and that in the referendum they will say “bye” to the EU. Our history is full of bad decisions that led to dramatic changes. With that in mind, Polish experts say that the impact of Brexit would be felt equally in Britain and in the EU. And as goes the EU, so go we. It is not just an economic question. Without Britain, European unity will be weaker. And beyond our eastern border, Vladimir Putin is calculating his next move after the Crimean Anschluss and setting fire to eastern Ukraine. A European Union weakened by Brexit might encourage him to light another blaze in our neighbourhood. If London says no on behalf of Britain, then almost certainly pro–­EU Scotland would declare independence. We Poles look on border changes in Europe with unease: Poland’s border has been shifted too often without asking Poles for their opinion, but at our cost. The very word Brexit is negative for us: something we have no means to resist. Even the European council president, Donald Tusk, can do little about it. The British discussion has, however, a Polish dimension. One of the main slogans used by Cameron and the British anti-EU critics is the fight against immigration and social benefit scams by foreigners. Poles are now the third biggest immigrant group in Britain after the Irish and Indians. Some estimates talk of a half million, or even 800,000, Polish immigrants who settled in the British Isles after Poland’s entry into the EU. They made use of the right of the free movement of people. In most cases they worked hard, strengthening the British economy. Anti-EU politicians have turned them into cheats and thieves. Recently Prince Jan Żyliński, the richest Pole in Britain, decided not to stand for Ukip’s witch-hunt. He publicly challenged Nigel Farage, who aimed his sharpest barbs at Poles, to a duel by sword in Hyde Park. But Farage chickened out. He didn’t even want a duel of words. He was ignominiously defeated in the May elections for the House of Commons. Now Żyliński should challenge Cameron to combat. Maybe that would change something. 
2538	2539	Tory reform plans are ‘lethal cocktail’ that could break up UK - Gordon Brown 	Gordon Brown has claimed the Tories’ plan to devolve all income tax powers to the Scottish parliament amounts to a “lethal cocktail” that could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. The former prime minister, who was speaking in a special Commons debate after the Scottish independence referendum, said the Tory plans were driven by narrow partisan interestthat could lead to the accidental collapse of the UK. Brown, who was widely credited with playing a decisive role in helping the no side win last month’s referendum, turned on the Tories after they drew a link between further devolution to and the creation of English votes for English laws at Westminster. The Tories, drawing on the work of a commission chaired by their former leader of the Lords Lord Strathclyde, have proposed that Westminster should fulfil the devolution “vow” by the leaders of the three main UK parties to Scotland by handing all powers over the setting of income tax to Holyrood. Scottish MPs would then be banned from voting on income tax in the rest of the UK. William Hague, the leader of the Commons, who is chairing a cabinet committee to examine English votes for English laws, said that a failure to address the West Lothian question would leave the UK in greater danger. This asks why Scottish MPs are allowed to vote on health and education in Scotland while English MPs have no say on such policy issues north of the border. Hague told MPs: “No one is suggesting delay in the commitments we have made to Scotland … Equally it is right to address the needs of England without delaying in the coming months. I know that there are members of the house who argue that to address this question is to somehow put the UK itself at risk. “But I say to them that the UK is in greater danger if the legitimate arguments and expectations of English decision-making, on decisions that effect only England are not responded to. Insensitivity and indifference is the danger to the union in all nations including in England.” But the former prime minister warned that the Tory plans would pose immense danger to the UK because they would downgrade Scottish MPs. “What makes for a lethal cocktail on this is that the Conservative party wants to devolve 100% of income tax to the Scottish parliament and then immediately end the right of Scottish MPs to vote on income tax on a matter as substantial as the budget in this parliament of the UK. “In the past any income tax rise has been based on the principle that all contribute and all benefit. Now under the Conservative proposal – including Scotland all would benefit from such a tax rise, if it was ever to happen. But only some, excluding Scotland, would contribute. “There is no state in the world, federal or otherwise, that devolves all of income tax from the national exchequer to regional, local or national assemblies. And there is not a parliament in the world that would impose a national income tax on only some of the country but not on all of the country.” Brown accused David Cameron of dishonesty in failing to explain his plans in clear terms to the people of Scotland during the referendum campaign. “It is the combination of the two proposals – to devolve 100% of income tax and then to remove the right of Scottish MPs to vote on the matter at Westminster – that is absolutely lethal for the constitution. “Scottish representatives would be able to vote on some of the business at Westminster but not all of it and would not be able to vote on some budget decisions on income tax and thus would undoubtedly become second class citizens at Westminster. “You cannot have one UK if you have two separate classes of MPs. You cannot have representatives elected by the people who are half in, half out of the lawmaking process. Let us remember the words in the New Testament in Mark quoted by Lincoln: a house divided cannot stand and a house divided is brought into destitution.” The former prime minister cited the US Congress to show the importance of acknowledging the special needs of minority states and nations. The founding fathers moved to bind the union together by allowing every state to elect two senators regardless of their size while the house of representatives is elected according to population size. Brown said: “When one part of the union [England] is 84% and the others are 8% [Scotland], 5% [Wales] and 3% [Northern Ireland] respectively you cannot secure the status of each nation through a blanket uniformity of provision. The rules needed to protect the minority are bound to be different from the rules to protect the majority who can always outvote the minority in this house.” The strongly-worded intervention suggests the UK’s main political parties are heading for a pre-election clash over the introduction of English votes for English laws after the Labour party announced that it would boycott a “Westminster stitch-up” on the issue. As the Commons debate opened, the . A Labour spokesperson said: “We will not be participating in a Westminster stitch-up. We think we need a constitutional convention so we can hear from all voices in England.” Labour believes that Tory plans to introduce English votes fro English laws is designed to scupper Ed Miliband’s chances of becoming prime minister next year. Opinion polls suggest that Miliband would need the support of Scottish MPs to form a UK government. The Lib Dems agree with the Tories on the need to devolve income tax-setting powers to Holyrood but they take a different approach on English laws. They believe that an English committee at Westminster, which should have a veto over legislation related to England, should be appointed according the overall vote share of parties rather than their number of MPs.
2540	2541	Speaker apologises to Tory minister for comparing her to washing machine 	The Speaker of the has apologised to a female Conservative minister for comparing her mode of speech to a washing machine that will not stop going round. John Bercow, who made the remark on Monday afternoon, said he was sorry for his words to the employment minister, , which may have been “foolish”. The Speaker issued his rebuke to McVey after deciding her answer to a question was too lengthy. “I am reminded of the feeling when one thinks the washing machine will stop – but it does not,” he said. He was then challenged in the Commons on Wednesday in a point of order by Conservative backbencher Heather Wheeler, who said: “You have always advised members of this house of the importance of showing respect to others in the workplace. “In that regard, is it appropriate in this house – which is a workplace – that a female minister should have been referred to as a washing machine?” Bercow said he had never compared McVey to a washing machine but added: “If I caused offence to an honourable member on Monday afternoon in the course of question time in rebuking her for a long answer – though it did result in a somewhat shorter one after that – but if I caused offence by what I said I very happily apologise to that member. “I intended to cause no offence to her. I hold her in the highest esteem. I hope I ordinarily treat members with great courtesy. It was an off-the-cuff remark, it may well have been a foolish one and I apologise for it.” During Monday’s debate, McVey also complained about a remark made by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who referred to her as a “hard-hearted Hannah”. She replied: “I do hope your opening comment wasn’t a sexist one, because I’ve had very many from the opposition benches.” McVey later raised a personal point of order, saying: “It is not the first time the opposition benches have been like this to me. John McDonnell actually came to my constituency, using unparliamentary language I know, he asked for people to ‘lynch the bitch’.”. Labour MP McDonnell told an event in McVey’s Wirral West constituency in November that he had heard an activist say: and defended himself, saying he was simply repeating the words of a constituent. Sheerman defended himself at the end of the debate, saying he had been a “long-term champion of the equality of women in our society and at work”. He added: “I think she thinks that was a sexist remark, it wasn’t meant as that. It is actually a name of a famous song sung by Ella Fitzgerald,” he added. “But she has a reputation for being a very hard champion of the welfare reforms this government has introduced and I believe it was fair comment, and unfair to call me a sexist.”
2541	2542	Samsung: the Galaxy Gear smartwatch is like unripened fruit 	"Samsung’s poorly received Galaxy Gear smartwatch was described as a “small green tomato” by David Eu, head of the Open Innovation Centre. According to , the Galaxy Gear has sold under 50,000 units since launching in for around £300 in September, far below industry expectations, although Samsung has yet to officially reveal any sales figures for the Galaxy Gear. “What we're dealing with is small green tomatoes. What we want to do is take care of them and work with them so they can become big red ripe tomatoes,” Eu said at the Ignition conference. “Over time this thing is going to get big and red – a big opportunity for us, and software services.” At the time of the Galaxy Gear’s launch Ian Fogg, director for mobile and telecoms at research firm IHS, commented that the Gear was ""a prototype masquerading as a commercial product — and because of that, it is unlikely to be successful in the market.""  He concluded: ""The device exhibits multiple shortcomings, including a high price tag, a short battery life, its status as a companion device and its limited compatibility. The bottom line is the Galaxy Gear smartwatch probably will not succeed in the market and Samsung will need to try again with a more refined product."" In September,  “We've acknowledged that our Gear lacks something special. With more investment for user interface and user experience, Samsung devices will be better in terms of customer satisfaction.” Samsung was to already have a second iteration of the Galaxy Gear in the works for a January 2014 launch at the US Consumer Electronics Show (CES) or Mobile World Congress (MWC) in March. Asked whether he was pleased with the way the Galaxy Gear turned out, Eu said: “I wouldn’t have bought the first one myself, but it has absolutely grown on me – I can see where it’s going.” from electronics retailer Best Buy in the US suggested the Galaxy Gear had a return rate as high as 30%. Eu liken the Galaxy Gear to an early stage startup, a “1.0 product” which “of course isn’t Gmail”, but he said that he didn’t think critics gave Samsung enough credit for integrating all the current functionality into the Gear. “I find it very difficult to believe the sales figures from Business Korea, given Samsung’s marketing and bundling of the Galaxy Gear with the Note 3. It just doesn’t seem to stack up with what we’re seeing,” said Ben Wood of research company CCS Insight. Despite of less than 900 units of the Gear being sold a day and less than 50,000 sales in total, Samsung is unlikely to release official numbers for the Gear until it hits a milestone like 500,000 sales, something that has yet to happen. Samsung’s Galaxy Gear wasn’t the first smartwatch on the market, beaten by first Sony’s LiveView and then the Smartwatch and most , as well as the . Research firm Canalys reported that 330,000 smartwatches were sold in 2012, lead by offerings from Sony and Motorola. That figure was predicted to rise to 500,000 total sales in 2013, with a further increase to 5m devices in 2014, as the market for smartwatches is expected to explode next year. Chris Jones, vice president of Canalys, believes that “smartwatches will be the most important new product category in consumer electronics""."
2542	2543	Aldi launches £80 tablet to rival Tesco’s Hudl 	"Aldi is the latest retailer to leap into the highly competitive budget tablet computer market with its new £79.99 low-end Medion Lifetab tablet. On sale from today, the Medion Lifetab E7316 faces stiff competition from other 7in tablets, including Google’s £199 Nexus 7, Amazon’s £99   and Tesco’s Hudl, which retails for  or less. While the 7in Medion Lifetab undercuts most of the competition by at least £20 – including Google’s Nexus 7 and Apple’s iPad mini – it does not compete so well on features, with similar specifications to . Compared to the  , the MyTablet offers a lower resolution screen, half the storage, a less powerful processor and reduced battery life. Available black, the tablet has full access to the Google Play store and can run any of the 850,000 standard Android apps. The Lifetab will come pre-loaded a series of free Android apps including a media player app, a drawing app, a Microsoft Office compatible work suite and a 30-day trail of Kaspersky Tablet Security. In the first half of 2013, almost 6m tablets were sold in the UK and demand is expected to accelerate into Christmas. According to data provided by research firm IDC, tablet computers are set to overtake PC sales this year, growing to 229.3m units worldwide. Meanwhile, 8.3m tablets were sold in the UK in 2012, according research firm CCS Insight, and more than half of sales came in the last quarter of the year alone. ""When it comes to tablets, the intensity of competition between UK retailers is staggering,"" said Ben Wood, mobile analyst with CCS Insight. High street retailer Argos sold 1m tablets in the UK in 2012, and recently Tesco announced that it had sold 300,000 Hudl tablets since its launch at the end of September. Aldi admits that it is “by no means the first supermarket to launch a budget tablet” but that at £80 it is “still one of the most competitive” meeting consumer interest for low-priced technology gifts.  ""Tablets under £100 have excellent gifting potential this Christmas,"" says Francisco Jeronimo, smartphones and tablets analyst with the research firm IDC. ""Parents looking to give gifts to children and teenagers are unlikely to spend £400-500 on a tablet, so tablets sub-£100 are less of an investment and more of an attractive disposable gift."" The Lifetab E7316 has a standard-definition 1,024 x 600 7in screen and runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. It is powered by a 1.6GHz quad-core processor, and has 8GB of storage as well as microSD and USB-host capability for connecting peripherals and storage. A front-facing VGA camera enables video chat, and a two-megapixel camera on the back will capture photos and video. A micro USB port provides PC connectivity and charging, while Bluetooth 2.1 allows connections to wireless headphones. Analysts agree that low-end tablets come at a price. Wood: ""At £79 tablets approaching 'disposable technology' levels with consumers barely pausing when they make a purchase. The sting in the tail is that price is obviously a key factor in product quality and consumers risk being disappointed by ultra low cost tablets."" ""You can be seduced by the price, but be very careful what you’re getting – there are trade offs when you get down to this kind of price,” explained Wood, quipping that ""if it carries on like this tablets will be falling out of cereal packets."" Budget tablet sales have been boosted by the demand for screens from children, says Wood, as parents use them as both education and entertainment tools. “The tablet has almost become the lazy childcare tool. It’s a kid pacifier – just pass the tablet into the back of the car to keep the children happy.”"

2550	2551	Jennifer Lawrence: 'I'm in Hawaii eating doughnuts' 	"f Hollywood needed an emblematic heroine for a year of hard times and tough decisions, it came in the form of Jennifer Lawrence: resolute, unyielding and somehow old beyond her age. Lawrence's earlier Oscar-nominated turn in the Ozark-noir proved the springboard for a brilliant 2012. There she was in the spring, wielding a bow-and-arrow as kill-or-be-killed Katniss Everdeen in , the year's best blockbuster. And there she was in the autumn, playing beautiful damaged goods alongside the likes of Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro in , the year's best rom-com, and our fourth best film of the year. We caught up with Lawrence on the set of Catching Fire, the second part of the Hunger Games franchise. I'm filming in Hawaii. But right now I'm eating doughnuts. I've just been inundated with doughnuts; it's a perk of the job. Well, thank you, that's awesome. I'm a little taken aback. I should have prepared a speech. It's a project I'm proud of. The cast and the crew gave it their all, working late nights, 15-hour days, trying to get it right. It was made with passion, that's for sure. Oh, that was nerve-racking. I had a habit of never looking at what scene we were doing next. But then the night before I looked ahead and thought: ""Oh my God, I've got to act against De Niro."" But it was fine. He's the nicest man in the world. He's actually very quiet. On set he keeps himself to himself and only pipes up when he has something proper to say. When he does pipe up, people listen. Yeah, it's called Serena. I was actually cast in that before starting Silver Linings Playbook, but we were still looking for the male lead. So one day I mentioned it to Brad and said: ""Do you want to do it?"" and he shrugged and said OK. You're breaking up. Did you ask if I was playing John Steinbeck? OK, because that would be weird. I know, but I'm just looking for interesting stories and strong characters. Maybe that's where the good material is. Maybe that's why I end up playing white-trash girls with too much responsibility. In a sense, in that it's where my family lives and it's where I grew up. But I don't know. These days I spend most of my time flipping between London [with her boyfriend, British actor Nicholas Hoult] and LA. I love London. I love the layout of the city and I love that it's not Manhattan or LA. In LA people are only interested in your job and how much money you make. In London that doesn't matter so much. People know that there are other things to talk about. Yes, of course. I worried that it would be overwhelming and that no one would be able to see me as any other character. But I really cared about the movie. I'm as proud of The Hunger Games as I am any of the other films I've done. Oh yeah, for sure. I remember when the first movie came out, seeing Kristen Stewart on the red carpet and getting papped wherever she went. I'd had no idea Twilight would be such a big deal. For me, and assuming for her, it was just another audition. Then it turned into this whole other thing. I really loved Argo, I thought that was brilliant. Um, what else? Seven Psychopaths was wonderful. But I haven't seen enough movies this year. I've been too busy working. No, I'm going home to see my family. My brother just told me in an email that we're all going to go clay-pigeon shooting. No, no, he's just found this place where they let you shoot clay-pigeons and then give you dinner afterwards. He's real excited about it. We've never done it before. I don't know what his shooting skills are like, I'm sure they're better than mine. I'm going to have to bring my bow-and-arrow."
2553	2554	First look at Woody Allen's 1920s romance Magic in the Moonlight 	The first trailer for Woody Allen's new film Magic in the Moonlight has appeared, and it seems to be a far more light-hearted film than his previous one, . Set in the 1920s, it stars as a magician who is sent to France to debunk the practices of Emma Stone's beguiling spiritualist – but the accuracy of her soothsaying and her impressive trickery have his cynicism challenged. Cue the gorgeous Mediterranean vistas that characterise Allen's Euro-tourist period, along with the pair getting fetchingly soaked in rain and heading towards an inevitable romance. Compared with the gloomy ruminations on ageing and aspiration that characterised the well-received Blue Jasmine, which , this is Allen going back to the knockabout farce and blithe May-December couplings that populate his lighter films. The supporting cast includes Marcia Gay Harden, Jacki Weaver, and Simon McBurney. Allen might understandably be trying to blot out reality with the magic of romance, amid a dark period in his personal life. The film emerges with his reputation at its most damaged, following from his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow that he sexually abused her as a child. Some old friends, like and , have publicly defended him, but it remains to be seen whether the saga has left too bitter a taste in the general public's mouth for this romance to slip down nicely. Allen can currently be seen in , playing a genteel pimp to John Turturro's middle-aged sex worker and incurable romantic. Emma Stone meanwhile in Woody Allen's next film, alongside Joaquin Phoenix.
2555	2556	Stagecoach earnings rise after bus and train contract wins 	 has reported a robust increase in earnings after winning a series of contracts to run London buses and an extension to its deal to operate the west coast mainline train service. Stagecoach and its joint venture partner Virgin Trains were recently awarded a revised deal to run the west coast mainline between London and Scotland until 2017 – an agreement that is expected . Although it is still too early to judge the success of the franchise extension, which began on 22 June, Stagecoach said business had been strong. It reported a 5% increase in quarterly revenues for its entire UK rail business on last year. The Perth-based transport group also benefited from winning two new bus contracts in London, adding to the services it runs in the south-east of the capital. London bus revenues were up 14%, although the company said earnings were lower than expected because of traffic disruption caused by roadworks. Stagecoach is one of the largest bus companies in the UK and earnings from its fleet of 8,100 regional buses and coaches, which account for more than a quarter of its revenue, were up 4%. The group, which runs no-frills coach service Megabus and Sheffield's super tram, reported that passenger numbers were up 0.9% over the quarter, bucking the trend of . Stagecoach has also teamed up with Virgin to bid for the east coast franchise, which is expected to be announced in November. The London-to-Edinburgh route has been in public ownership since 2009, but is due to make . Stagecoach is also one of three shortlisted bidders for the TransPennine Express rail franchise along with FirstGroup and Keolis, which currently run the service in a joint venture.
2557	2558	Petrol prices push inflation to highest since April 2012 	" in the UK has risen to its highest level for more than a year, putting a further squeeze on workers struggling with stagnant wages. The will also pose a challenge for the new Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and his fellow policymakers as they look for ways to boost Britain's fragile recovery while keeping a lid on living costs. Still, the rate was not as high as the 3% forecast by economists and was well below the 3.1% level that would have forced Carney to write an explanatory open letter to the chancellor, George Osborne. Economists warned that persistently high inflation would dampen optimism about Britain's economic prospects following some . ""There are growing signs of the UK recovery gaining momentum, with the economy set for strong growth in the second quarter and companies reporting the brightest outlook for the year ahead since the financial crisis struck, but inflation clearly remains the UK's bugbear and calls into question just how long this strong growth can persist for,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data specialists Markit. ""High prices look set to continue to erode spending power, curbing the overall pace of economic growth."" The (ONS) said its consumer prices measure, based on a basket of goods and services, slipped 0.2% in June from May. But compared with a year ago they were up 2.9%, the highest annual inflation since April 2012. The biggest upward pressure came from petrol and diesel prices, which both rose by around a penny this June but fell in June 2012. There was also upward pressure from clothing prices after summer sales this year did not bring as many discounts as in 2012. The retail price index measure of inflation, used as the benchmark for many pay deals, rose to 3.3% from 3.1% in May. Both rates of inflation markedly outstrip , meaning real wages continue to fall. But the Treasury welcomed the fact that consumer price inflation had eased from the high hit in September 2008. A spokesman said: ""Inflation is down significantly from its peak of 5.2%. At the same time, to help families with the cost of living, the government has increased the tax-free personal allowance to £10,000, which will take 2.4 million people out of income tax altogether and save a typical basic rate taxpayer almost £600, and frozen fuel duty which has kept petrol prices 13p per litre lower than they would otherwise have been."" But the shadow Treasury minister Catherine McKinnell argued that after inflation, wages were down by an average of more than £1,300 since the coalition came to power. ""With prices now rising much faster than wages the cost-of-living crisis is getting worse. Despite all the complacent claims from ministers about the economy, these figures show that for ordinary people life is getting harder under David Cameron's government,"" she said. The ONS published separate data alongside the inflation showing . The prices charged by manufacturers were up 2% on the year compared with forecasts for 1.9% and with 1.2% in May. That came as their costs, or input prices, rose an annual 4.2%, the biggest increase for more than a year. Economists said those numbers and a rise in the core rate of consumer price inflation, which excludes erratic items such as fuel, would raise concerns among policymakers about the potential for inflation to rise further still. Bank policymakers have made it clear, however, that they will take a flexible approach to inflation targeting if the broader economic picture requires it. That potentially paves the way for more quantitative easing – pumping cash into the economy by buying bonds from financial institutions – despite above-target inflation."
2558	2559	Four in 10 might join consumer boycott over tax avoidance 	"The extent of public anger over the perceived failure of some big corporations to pay enough tax has been made clear by a Guardian/ICM poll which finds that 42% of consumers may boycott companies as a result. The survey is published after it emerged that and received a £5m credit from the Treasury, even though it had turnover of £1.8bn. Thames Water, which serves nearly a quarter of the population, reported profits of £550m. At the same time, bills went up 6.7%. Days before David Cameron chairs the G8 summit, at which he has promised to , the ICM survey finds that 21% of those questioned agreed that it was ""very likely"" they would refuse to use brands that have made headlines over their tax affairs, including Amazon, Starbucks and Google. Another 20% said it was ""quite likely"" they would support a boycott. A further 31% said it was ""not very likely"" they would stop using a company because of its tax stance and 24% said it was not likely at all. Politicians who have campaigned on corporate taxation will be emboldened by the findings. But the companies concerned will also comfort themselves with the thought that it is much easier to tell a survey of an intention to pursue a boycott than to stick one out in practice. The figures show a wide disparity by age. Whereas student campuses have often been associated with direct political action in the past, it is now the older part of the population that is more inclined to boycott companies over tax. Only 28% of the youngest voters, aged 18 to 24, say they would be likely to refuse to use tax-avoiding brands. This rises to 38% of those aged 25-34, 41% among those aged 35-64, and again, to become an overall majority of 54%, among the over-65s. This picture of consumer activism that increases with age is even starker among those who say they would be ""very likely"" to withdraw their custom over tax. The respective figures are: just 14% of the 18-24s; 15% of the 25s-34s; 22% of the 35-64s; and 30% of those aged 65 and up. Ipsos/MORI is publishing a separate report for the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust which finds grave pessimism among the young. The report finds ""common ground"" among Britons of all ages that ""it is the youngest generations … that are expected to bear the brunt of the current economic problems"" in terms of housing, job opportunities, benefit cutbacks and future pensions. The latest recorded an economy-wide unemployment rate of 7.8% rising to 20.7% among those aged 16-24, and Ipsos finds that the hardship that young people are experiencing in the slump is reshaping their attitudes. But some 49% of those born since 1980 point the finger at the recession as an important barrier in the way of unemployed people getting a job, compared with just 32% of the older voters born during or before the second world war. Whereas 79% of the prewar generation believe that their own generation has had a better life than their parents, among the youngest this figure drops to 42%. Bobby Duffy, who led the Ipsos research, said: ""Younger people are having a tougher time, and this makes them different. It's not that they don't care – but they are more pessimistic, more individualistic and perhaps that leaves them less clear about how to come together to get things changed."""
2559	2560	Supermarkets cut petrol prices again 	"The big supermarkets cut their petrol prices for the second time in less than a week – but the AA said there was still scope for further reductions. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury are slicing 2p off a litre of petrol as wholesale prices continue to fall amid lower crude oil values. The latest Asda cut will mean its customers will pay no more than 131.7p a litre of petrol from Saturdaymorning, with Asda diesel staying at 135.7p a litre. But the price of petrol can still depend on location. This week, a substantial number of supermarket and non-supermarket fuel stations were selling petrol at 132p-133p a litre in Staffordshire, London and some other areas, according to the AA. Edmund King, the president of the AA, repeated his call for the government to intervene and force oil companies to publish the price of wholesale petrol and diesel to help make pump prices more transparent. ""We are not calling for regulation but experience in the US, Australia and elsewhere shows that a bit more openness brings more stability. It might help remove the concerns of motorists that retail prices are quick to go up [when the wholesale price goes up] but slow to go down [when the opposite happens]"". Peter Cattell, Tesco's petrol category director, said both petrol and diesel could be reduced in price. ""As Britain's biggest fuel retailer, with 497 forecourts, more motorists make savings at Tesco petrol filling stations than any other fuel retailer,"" he added. Richard Crampton, Sainsbury's head of fuel, said: ""We're always looking for ways to help customers save money and we know that fuel is a big part of household budgets, so from tomorrow we will be reducing the price of unleaded at our 280 forecourts by up to 2p per litre."""

Wilson finally debuted Smile in a concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London in 2004, which presaged a fully fledged career revival.
